In other words, when the distance between the two points is equal to the width of the blur at half its height, that\u2019s about the limit of what the imaging system can resolve. Any closer, and the system can no longer distinguish the two points. This is why we say spatial resolution is the minimum separation at which two objects can still be seen as distinct.
