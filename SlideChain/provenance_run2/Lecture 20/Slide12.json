It looks like the frame of a cylindrical cage - a circular structure with evenly spaced conducting bars connected at both ends by rings. When an alternating current flows through these bars, it creates a rotating magnetic field inside the bore. This rotating field is the B-one field, which is applied perpendicular to the main magnetic field B-zero. The B-one field is responsible for exciting the protons and flipping the magnetization vector, M, away from its alignment with B-zero.",
