For a typical 1.5-tesla scanner, this voltage oscillates at around 63.9 megahertz-that's an extremely high frequency-and its strength is only a few microvolts. Because it's so high and so weak, it's very difficult to digitize the signal directly. To make digitization possible, we first have to demodulate the signal-in other words, we shift it from that very high Larmor frequency down to a much lower intermediate frequency, usually around 10.7 megahertz.",
