The equation looks straightforward: next year's population depends on this year's population and a growth rate factor, r. But because of the nonlinear term involving the population itself, the system's behavior changes dramatically depending on the value of r. When the population is small, growth is nearly linear. But as the population approaches the environment's limits, growth slows-resources become scarce, and the population stabilizes or even declines. This simple model reflects how nature regulates itself."
