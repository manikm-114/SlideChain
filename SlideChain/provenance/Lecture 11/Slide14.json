These numbers are very close to one, reflecting the fact that the images are almost identical to our eyes. On the bottom row, however, we see very different results. One image has been heavily pixelated, another blurred, and another corrupted with noise. When compared to the original, their SSIM values drop significantly - around 0.67, 0.69, and about 0.72. That means they retain only about two-thirds of the structural similarity. The important thing here is that SSIM values line up with what we visually perceive. Images that look good to us score close to one. Images that look distorted or degraded score much lower. That is the power of SSIM - it bridges the gap between mathematical measurement and human vision."
