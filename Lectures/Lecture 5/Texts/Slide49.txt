Up to this point, everything we’ve talked about has been in one dimension. But in real-world applications—especially in imaging—we usually work with two-dimensional data. Think about a photograph, a CT slice, or an MRI frame. These are functions of two variables, not just one.
So, does the Fourier series still apply? Absolutely. In fact, the transition to two dimensions is very smooth and intuitive.

Let’s start with the formula at the top. This is the 2D Fourier transform, or more precisely, the 2D discrete Fourier series. It converts a spatial domain function into a frequency domain representation.

We begin with a function f of m and n. Here, m and n are the spatial coordinates, like pixel row and column indices.
Then we compute the capital F of x and y, which is the frequency-domain representation of the image. We get it using a double summation—from m equals 0 to M minus 1, and from n equals 0 to N minus 1.
Each term in the sum includes f of m and n, multiplied by a complex exponential:e to the power negative j 2 pi times x times m over M plus y times n over N.
This is just the 2D extension of what we did before in 1D—now applied along both spatial directions.

Next, let’s look at the inverse transform—the formula at the bottom.
Here, we reconstruct the original image, f of m and n, from its frequency components, F of x and y. Again, we use a double summation ranging from 0 to M minus 1 and N minus 1.
And we add a normalization factor of 1 divided by M times N.
The exponential now becomes:e to the power positive j 2 pi times x times m over M plus y times n over N.

So once again, we’re projecting onto a set of complex exponential basis functions—just like in the 1D case, but now expanded to two dimensions.
This idea even extends naturally to three dimensions, which is useful for things like volumetric imaging, 3D scans, or dynamic time-sequence data in medical imaging.

So to summarize: the 2D Fourier series gives us a powerful way to analyze images in terms of spatial frequencies. It's conceptually the same as the 1D case—just applied in two directions simultaneously.
