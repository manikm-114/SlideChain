This representation makes that idea visual and intuitive.

Here, each person is holding a different sine wave — each wave has a different frequency or amplitude. When we add these waves together, we get a more complex waveform — something that might look jagged, or smooth, or anything in between.

And this is the foundation of the Fourier series. It tells us that any reasonable function — smooth or sharp — can be represented as a weighted sum of sine and cosine waves. These sinusoidal components differ in frequency, phase, and amplitude. But together, they can recreate signals of almost any shape.

So, just like we saw earlier that a function could be built from impulses, here we’re seeing that a function can also be built from waves. These are two complementary viewpoints — both valid, both powerful.
