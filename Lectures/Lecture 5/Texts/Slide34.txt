Now we arrive at a full summary of the real form of the Fourier series.
What we’ve seen so far is that many well-behaved functions — especially those that are continuous and square-integrable — can be expressed as a weighted sum of sine and cosine waves.And this formula at the top captures that structure precisely.

We start with the function f of t.Then we write it as the sum of three components:
First, the DC component, which is a naught over 2. That’s the constant or average value of the function — the non-oscillating part.
Next comes the cosine sum, where each term involves a coefficient a n times cosine of 2 pi n t.
And finally, we have the sine sum, where each term includes b n times sine of 2 pi n t.
These coefficients — a naught, a n, and b n — are what determine how much of each sine or cosine wave contributes to the reconstruction of f of t.
So how do we find them?

Well, we already know the answer from earlier in the lecture: we compute inner products.That is, we take the integral of the product of our function f of t with each basis function, over the interval from 0 to 1.
For the constant term, a naught over 2, we simply integrate f of t from 0 to 1.
To get a n, we multiply f of t by the cosine of 2 pi n t and integrate.
For b n, we do the same with the sine of 2 pi n t.

Once you have these values, you plug them back into the series.And when you sum it all up — the constants, the cosines, and the sines — you recreate your original function, or at least approximate it very closely.
It’s almost magical.You could be working with a smooth parabola, or a sharp triangular wave, or even a jagged, piecewise function — and yet, you can reconstruct it entirely using just sine and cosine waves. That’s the power of the Fourier series.

Now, remember earlier in the course we looked at functions in terms of discrete particles or impulses — like pixel-based representations. That gave us a kind of particle view of functions.
But this approach gives us a wave-based view — continuous, smooth, and grounded in frequency content.
Both are valid. And each is powerful in its own context.

But here’s a question worth asking:Why would we ever want to use the complex form of the Fourier series?
Well, look at this real version. It’s elegant, yes — but it involves three separate types of terms: one for the DC component, one for cosine, and one for sine.
By switching to the complex form, we can merge all of this into a single sum using Euler’s formula, where complex exponentials capture both sine and cosine behavior simultaneously.
This makes the whole formulation more compact and symmetrical.
The math becomes cleaner. The algebra gets easier. And in engineering applications, it often leads to more efficient computations.
So while the real form gives us intuitive clarity, the complex form offers analytical elegance.
That’s exactly where we’re headed next.
Let’s now explore how complex numbers help us take the Fourier series to the next level.
