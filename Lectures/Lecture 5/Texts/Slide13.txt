Now let’s step back and summarize what we’ve built so far — the formal structure of a vector space, especially in R-n, that is, n-dimensional real space.A vector in this space is just an ordered list of n numbers.
For example, we could define vector v as: v equals v1, v2, and so on, up to vn.And similarly, another vector w would be: w equals w1, w2, all the way to wn.
Now, the inner product of these two vectors is written as:v dot w equals v1 times w1, plus v2 times w2, plus all the way up to vn times wn.

This formula isn’t arbitrary. It’s grounded in both geometric intuition and practical applications — including signal detection and system analysis. But geometrically, it gives us the clearest picture of how vectors interact.
For example, if we take the inner product of a vector with itself, we get: v dot v equals the sum of the squares of its components. That is: v1 squared plus v2 squared, and so on, up to vn squared. Which is simply the squared length of the vector — or the norm squared. 

So we write: v dot v equals double bar v double bar squared.
This gives us the magnitude of a vector, which is fundamental to defining distance, angle, and orthogonality — even in very high-dimensional spaces.
Now, let’s talk about basis.In R-n, we use what’s called the natural basis. These are vectors of length one that point along each coordinate direction.So we define:e1 as 1, 0, 0, and so on,e2 as 0, 1, 0, and so on,and so on, up to en, which is 0, 0, and finally 1.

Each of these vectors is orthogonal to the others, meaning their inner product is zero unless you're comparing a vector with itself.
So any vector v can be written as a linear combination of these basis vectors. That is: v equals v1 times e1, plus v2 times e2, all the way up to vn times en.
And how do we get each of these coefficients?
Simple — by taking the inner product of v with the corresponding basis vector. So we say: v dot ek equals vk.
This structure — combining orthogonality, projection, and basis expansion — gives us a clean and consistent framework for working with any dimensional space. Whether we’re dealing with 3D vectors in physics, or a hundred-dimensional space in data analysis, the math works the same way.
And beneath it all is a visual, geometric idea: projecting, aligning, and reconstructing using components along axes.That’s the foundation of vector spaces.
