Let’s close this section with a powerful and elegant idea — something that ties everything we’ve learned so far into a single, intuitive picture.Every vector is a point.That’s right — a vector isn’t just a list of numbers. It represents a location in space.

For example, in two-dimensional space, a vector with components x and y — written as x, y — can be seen as a point on the plane.If this vector has unit length — meaning its magnitude is one — then it lies on the unit circle.As you move around that circle, each position corresponds to a different vector, but all with the same length.
Now in three dimensions, the same idea holds.A unit-length vector becomes a point on the surface of a unit sphere.Again, the magnitude is one, but the direction can vary.And every point on the sphere represents a different vector of unit length.
This concept scales beautifully to higher dimensions.
In general, if we’re in n-dimensional space, the collection of all vectors of the same length — say, length r — forms an n-sphere.
Mathematically, we write this as: S n equals open curly brace x in R n plus 1, such that double bar x double bar equals r close curly brace.
This simply means: we’re gathering all the vectors that are at a fixed distance r from the origin.Each of these vectors is also a point in space.They all have the same magnitude — r — but different directions.
So geometrically, a vector is just a point, and when we fix the length of these vectors, they trace out meaningful shapes like circles in 2D, spheres in 3D, or hyperspheres in higher dimensions.

This perspective becomes especially important as we move forward into signal processing and functional spaces, where even functions can be treated like vectors — and those vectors live in infinite-dimensional spaces.
But the core idea doesn’t change.A vector is a point. A point is a vector.And the same geometry that applies to physical space applies to abstract spaces as well — including the ones we’ll encounter next in our study of Fourier series.
