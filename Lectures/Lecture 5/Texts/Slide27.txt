Let’s now take a closer look at something we claimed earlier — that the set of sine and cosine functions, together with the constant function, form what we call an orthonormal basis.

Now, this idea might sound a bit abstract at first. But if we break it down, it’s very intuitive.
In the world of regular vectors — say, in two or three dimensions — we say vectors are orthogonal if they’re at right angles to each other. And if each one also has a length of one, we call them orthonormal.
The same idea applies in function space. But instead of using a dot product like we do for regular vectors, we use something called an inner product — which is defined using an integral. This inner product helps us measure both length and angle between functions.

Let’s walk through the specific relationships shown here.
First, the constant function — just the number one — has unit length. That means if we take its inner product with itself, we get one. So it’s normalized.
Now let’s see what happens when we compare the constant function with a cosine or a sine function. If we take the inner product of the constant with cosine of two pi times n times t, we get zero — for any positive integer n. The same is true for sine.

Why does this happen? Well, cosine and sine both oscillate above and below the horizontal axis, and over a full cycle, the positive and negative areas cancel out. So when you compare either of them with the constant, the result is zero — meaning they’re orthogonal.

Next, let’s compare sine and cosine functions with each other. Say, cosine of two pi times m times t and sine of two pi times n times t. Regardless of which frequencies m and n we choose, their inner product is zero. So sine and cosine are always orthogonal to each other.

Now here’s where it gets a bit more subtle.
If we compare cosine functions with other cosine functions — or sine with sine — the result depends on the frequencies.
If the frequencies are different, meaning m is not equal to n, the inner product is zero. They’re orthogonal.
But if the frequencies match — so m equals n — the inner product is one-half. That means the functions are not quite unit-length yet. They’re orthogonal but not normalized.

To fix that, we just scale the sine and cosine functions by the square root of two. Then, their inner product with themselves becomes exactly one, making the whole set orthonormal.
So here’s the big picture: we now have a set of functions — the constant, sine waves, and cosine waves — that are all mutually perpendicular and have unit length. Together, they form a complete orthonormal basis.

And once we have this basis, we can represent any periodic function as a combination of these building blocks. That combination is what we call the Fourier series, and the weights we use — the Fourier coefficients — tell us how much of each wave is present in the function.
Next, we’ll explore how to actually compute those coefficients using integrals.
Let’s keep going.
