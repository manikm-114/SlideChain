So far, we’ve been casually treating the inner product as a simple dot product — point-by-point multiplication followed by a sum. That works just fine when we’re dealing with real-valued vectors.
But when we step into complex vector spaces, things get a bit more subtle. In particular, we have to be careful with how we define the inner product. In the complex world, it’s not enough to just multiply and add — we also need to take the complex conjugate of one of the vectors before doing so.
Let’s break this down with a simple example.

Suppose we have two complex vectors. Let’s call them X and Y.
Vector X has two components:the first is a one plus b one times i,and the second is a two plus b two times i.
Similarly, vector Y has components:c one plus d one times i,and c two plus d two times i.
Now, how do we compute the length of vector X?
In complex space, we use the sum of the squared magnitudes of each component. So the magnitude of X is the square root ofa one squared plus b one squared plus a two squared plus b two squared.
We do the same for vector Y — square the real and imaginary parts of each component, add them up, and then take the square root.

Now, here’s the key idea.
If these two complex vectors — X and Y — are orthogonal, and we add them together to form a new vector Z, we expect the squared length of Z to equal the squared length of X plus the squared length of Y. That’s just the Pythagorean theorem in vector space.
But for that identity to hold, one critical condition must be met:the cross-term — the inner product between X and Y — must vanish. In other words, the inner product between X and Y has to be zero.
And this is where the complex conjugate becomes important.

In real vector spaces, we just take the dot product. But in complex spaces, we define the inner product as:X dot Y conjugate.
That means, we keep vector X as it is, and we take the complex conjugate of each component of Y before multiplying.
This adjustment ensures that everything works out mathematically:we preserve orthogonality, we maintain proper lengths, and we uphold the geometry of the space.
So, whenever we’re working with complex vectors — in signal processing, in quantum mechanics, or in Fourier analysis — this conjugation step is absolutely essential.

Now, don’t worry about memorizing the formulas. That’s why I added this green bubble here — it’s just a reminder that this is more about understanding the concept than remembering every detail.
Once you internalize this idea — that conjugation is needed to define meaningful inner products in complex space — everything that follows, including the complex form of the Fourier series, will feel much more natural.
Let’s now move forward and apply this idea in the Fourier domain.
