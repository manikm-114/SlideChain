Before that, here’s a really elegant and surprisingly powerful idea in mathematical analysis — something that’s often overlooked, but incredibly useful in practice.
No matter what function you're dealing with — call it f of x — you can always split it into two parts:an even part, and an odd part.

And here’s how that works.
We define the even part, denoted f e of x, as“f of x plus f of negative x, all divided by two.”
Mathematically, that’s:f e of x equals one-half times the sum of f of x and f of minus x.
If you plug in negative x into this expression, you’ll get:f e of minus x equals one-half times f of minus x plus f of x —which is exactly the same as f e of x.So this part is symmetric — it satisfies the condition of an even function.

Then, we define the odd part, written as f o of x,by subtracting instead of adding. So you get:f o of x equals one-half times f of x minus f of negative x.
Now, if you evaluate this at negative x, you’ll find that:f o of negative x equals negative f o of x.That’s the signature of an odd function — it’s antisymmetric about the origin.

So here’s the beauty:Every function, no matter how it looks, can be written as the sum of its even and odd parts.
In other words,f of x equals f e of x plus f o of x.
This is a universal decomposition — and it's not just a neat identity.
It plays a critical role in understanding symmetry in signals, especially in Fourier analysis, where even and odd functions relate directly to cosine and sine components, respectively.
So remember this trick.Whenever you’re working with a function — especially in signal processing or image analysis — it’s often helpful to ask:What’s its even part? What’s its odd part?And how can we take advantage of that symmetry?
We’ll put this idea to use shortly when we calculate the Fourier coefficients.
