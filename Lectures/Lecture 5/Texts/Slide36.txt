When we work with complex numbers, there are two very common ways to describe them:the Cartesian form and the polar form.Both are fully equivalent, and they each offer a different way of thinking about the same quantity.

Let’s begin with the Cartesian form. This is what we’ve seen already:A complex number is written as x plus i times y, where x is the real part, and y is the imaginary part.So we’re essentially giving the horizontal and vertical coordinates of a point in the complex plane — just like specifying a location on a map.

Now, in engineering, we often replace the symbol i with j to represent the imaginary unit. This is purely to avoid confusion — because in electrical engineering, i is usually reserved for current.But mathematically, i and j mean the same thing: they both satisfy the fundamental property that i squared equals negative one.
The other way to describe a complex number is through polar coordinates.Instead of saying how far right and up the point is, we describe the number by its magnitude and angle.
So what does that mean?

We draw a line from the origin to the point — that’s the complex number — and call its length r. That’s the magnitude, or modulus, and it’s calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:r equals the square root of x squared plus y squared.This is also written as the absolute value of z.

Next, we describe the angle that line makes with the positive real axis.That angle is called theta, and we compute it as the inverse tangent of y over x.So now, we have two pieces: r and theta — the magnitude and direction.
With that, we can now express the same complex number in polar form.
In place of x plus i y, we write:
r times cosine theta plus i times r sine theta.Or, factoring out the r:r times the quantity cosine theta plus i sine theta.

This is the foundation for something beautiful: Euler’s formula, which we’ll talk about in the next slide.Euler discovered that cosine theta plus i sine theta is equal to e to the i theta — giving us a powerful exponential representation of complex numbers.
Before we leave this slide, here’s one more important result:If you multiply a complex number by its conjugate — in other words, z times z bar — you get a purely real number.

Let’s walk through it:z is x plus i y, and its conjugate is x minus i y.When you multiply them together, you get x squared plus y squared, which is just the magnitude squared.
This shows that the conjugate cancels out the imaginary part, leaving only a real value — something very useful in analysis and signal processing.
So just like vectors, complex numbers let us switch back and forth between rectangular and polar systems.
Each form brings its own advantages, and we’ll soon see how this flexibility pays off — especially when we start rewriting Fourier series using complex exponentials.
Let’s move to Euler’s formula and take this further.
