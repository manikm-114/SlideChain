Let’s now take a step back and look at the inner product from a geometric perspective. This viewpoint helps us build strong intuition, especially as we move into higher dimensions.

Start by imagining two-dimensional space. You have a vector A, which we can think of as a point in that space. Now, add another non-zero vector, let’s call it vector B. Along with the zero vector — that’s the origin — these two define a straight line. This line contains all the scalar multiples of vector B. In other words, the line L of k equals k times vector B, where k is any real number.

Now here’s the key idea: we want to project vector A onto that line. In other words, we want to find the point on the line that’s closest to vector A. Mathematically, this means finding the value of k that minimizes the distance between vector A and k times vector B.

The expression shown here represents that squared distance. It’s written as the sum, from i equals 1 to N, of the square of the quantity ai minus k times bi. That’s essentially the Euclidean distance, squared — but applied component-wise in vector form.

This is an extension of the classic distance formula you saw in high school geometry: the square root of x one minus x two squared, plus y one minus y two squared. But now, we’re doing it in higher dimensions.

To minimize the distance, we take the derivative of that squared distance with respect to k, set it to zero, and solve for k. When we do that, we arrive at this important formula:
k equals the inner product of vector A and vector B, divided by the squared norm of vector B.
That gives us the scaling factor for the projection.And then, the distance from the origin to the projected point is:
D equals A dot B, divided by the norm of B.
This leads us back to a central identity in geometry:
A dot B equals the length of A times the length of B times the cosine of theta, where theta is the angle between the two vectors.
So what does this all mean geometrically?

The inner product tells us how much of vector A lies in the direction of vector B.It’s the projection of A onto B, scaled by how aligned the two are — and that alignment is captured by the cosine of the angle.
If A and B are orthogonal — that means they’re at a ninety-degree angle — then the cosine is zero, and so is the inner product.But if they point in the same direction, the cosine is one, and the projection is at its maximum.

So this isn’t just an abstract formula. It gives us a powerful visual interpretation of what the inner product is really doing — measuring alignment.
And this interpretation extends naturally into higher dimensions, which makes it especially useful as we transition into Fourier series.
