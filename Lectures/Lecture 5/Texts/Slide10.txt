Now let’s focus on a familiar and intuitive case — three-dimensional space.This diagram provides a clear geometric visualization that many of you have likely encountered before.
We’re looking at a vector — let’s call it vector A — situated in three-dimensional space.You can think of vector A as an arrow pointing from the origin to some point in space.
Alternatively, you can think of it simply as a collection of coordinates.
Either way, vector A is completely described by its three components —x A, y A, and z A —which correspond to its projections along the x, y, and z axes.

Now, here’s the key idea:Each of these components represents how much vector A "points" in the direction of one of the coordinate axes.
If you project vector A onto the x-axis, you get x A.Project it onto the y-axis, and you get y A.Project it onto the z-axis, and you get z A.
This method of description is based on an orthogonal basis,which simply means the axes are all perpendicular to each other —at right angles.
And here’s the important part:If you know x A, y A, and z A,you have everything you need to reconstruct the entire vector A.
That’s because vector A is just the sum of its three projections —each one scaled by a unit vector in the x, y, or z direction.

Mathematically, we write:vector A equalsx A times i-hat,plus y A times j-hat,plus z A times k-hat.
Here, i-hat is the unit vector along the x-axis,j-hat is the unit vector along the y-axis,and k-hat is the unit vector along the z-axis.
This idea generalizes beautifully to higher dimensions.Instead of working with x, y, and z,you’ll have more axes — more basis directions —but the principle stays the same.
And here’s where this becomes really exciting:
In Fourier analysis, we do something very similar,but instead of projecting onto spatial axes,we project onto a set of basis functions —like sine and cosine waves.
So, what you’re seeing here in 3Dis not just about vectors in space.It’s the same foundational idea that lets usanalyze and reconstruct complex signalsin the frequency domain.
Understanding this orthogonal representationsets us up perfectly for the world of Fourier series.
