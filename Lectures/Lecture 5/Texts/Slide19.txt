Sine and cosine waves show up everywhere in nature —and there's a beautiful reason for that.They arise naturally from circular motion.
Let’s take a simple example.
Imagine a point moving in a perfect circle —like the moon orbiting the Earth at constant speed.

Now, if you shine a light on that motionand watch the shadow it casts onto a flat surface —say, the x-axis —what do you get?
You get a sine wave.
That’s right —as the point moves around the circle,its horizontal position follows a smooth wave.That’s sine.
And if you project onto the y-axis instead,you get a cosine wave.

So these waveforms — sine and cosine —are really just the shadows of circular motion.
That’s a profound idea.
It tells us that sine and cosine functionsaren’t just mathematical inventions —they’re embedded in the geometry and physics of the real world.
They describe how things rotate, how waves travel,how springs vibrate, how light and sound move.
And because of this,sine and cosine waves form the foundation of somethingwe’ll explore in depth — the Fourier series.

So far, we’ve seen two major ways to represent functions:
First, as a sum of impulses —like tiny samples or pixel points in space.
And now, as a sum of sinusoids —waves that capture how a signal behaves across frequencies.
Both perspectives are incredibly powerful.They help us describe, analyze, and reconstruct datain ways that are both mathematically precise and physically meaningful.

In the next section, we’ll dive into howthese sine and cosine functions can be usedas a basis to build any function you like —just like we built vectors from orthogonal components.
