Let’s take a moment to reflect on something deeper — a principle that reaches beyond signal processing and touches the foundations of physics and information itself.

In physics, we talk about the wave-particle duality — the idea that entities like photons and electrons exhibit both particle-like and wave-like behavior. Depending on how you observe them, they might act like tiny particles... or spread out like waves.
Interestingly, we see a similar duality in information science.

On one side, we have the particle view: information as discrete units — like pixels in an image, impulses in a signal, or delta functions in a mathematical model. This is the pixel-by-pixel, sample-by-sample perspective. It's granular and local.
On the other side, we have the wave view: information described in terms of global, smooth, continuous oscillations — sinusoidal waves of varying frequency, amplitude, and phase. This perspective captures structure across space or time — the big picture.

So when we represent a function — or an image, or a signal — we can choose either perspective.
Using delta functions or impulses, we build the signal by assembling localized pieces — one sharp component at a time.
Using sinusoidal functions, we build it using smooth, periodic waveforms that span the domain.
Both approaches are valid. In fact, they are mathematically equivalent when used with the right basis. 
And this is the central idea of today’s lecture:
A function can be viewed as a vector in a high-dimensional space — and depending on our basis, we can represent that function in many different ways.
You can think of a delta basis: where each basis function is an impulse at a specific location.
Or a sinusoidal basis: where each basis function is a sine or cosine wave with a different frequency.
These are just two different coordinate systems for the same space — and by projecting the function onto the basis elements, we retrieve coefficients that let us reconstruct the original signal as a linear combination.

So in summary:The delta basis gives us a particle-like view.The sinusoidal basis gives us a wave-like view.And both help us understand information from complementary perspectives.

This concludes the first part of our discussion — building intuition through geometry and representation.
In the second half, we’ll go deeper into Fourier series, where we work with periodic functions, and learn how to express them precisely in terms of sine and cosine components. We’ll take a short break now — about ten minutes — and then dive right into the math.
See you shortly.
