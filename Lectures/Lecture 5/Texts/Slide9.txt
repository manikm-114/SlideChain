Now let’s take everything we’ve learned so far and generalize it to n-dimensional space — what we call “R n,” or more formally, R superscript n.
Suppose we have two vectors:Vector V has components v i,and vector W has components w i.

These indices — the little i — run from 1 to n, where n is the number of dimensions.So V and W are points in high-dimensional space.But just like in two or three dimensions, we can still calculate the distance between them.

That distance is given by this formula:D squared of V and W equals the sum over i of v i minus w i, squared.
This is just a generalization of the Pythagorean theorem.
In two dimensions, it gives the diagonal of a square.In three dimensions, it gives the diagonal of a cube.In n dimensions, it gives the straight-line — or Euclidean — distance between two points.

Next, let’s talk about projection — projecting one vector onto the line defined by the other.For instance, we can project vector V onto the direction of vector W.To do this, we find the scalar value k that minimizes the distance between V and the scaled version of W.
Mathematically, that means minimizing the squared distance —the sum over i of v i minus k times w i, squared.

The optimal value of k — the one that minimizes that distance — is given by:k equals V dot W, over the norm of W squared.
This result comes directly from taking the derivative of the squared distance with respect to k,setting it equal to zero, and solving.And look what appears naturally in the formula: the dot product, or inner product.So this isn’t a random definition — it’s rooted in geometry.
That brings us to another essential concept: angle and orthogonality.

We can also express the inner product as:V dot W equals norm of V times norm of W times cosine theta —where theta is the angle between the two vectors.
So when theta equals 90 degrees, cosine theta is zero, and the inner product is zero.That’s the condition for orthogonality — when vectors are perpendicular.

Even in R n — in any number of dimensions — the inner product continues to define distance, projection, angle, and orthogonality.These aren’t just abstract mathematical ideas.They are the foundation for understanding how high-dimensional geometry works.And they’re essential tools in areas like signal analysis, data science, and machine learning.
Finally, don’t forget about basis and dimensionality.
In two dimensions, you need two basis vectors — usually along the x and y axes.In n-dimensional space, you need n basis vectors to describe any direction or position fully.
And in our upcoming discussion of Fourier series, we’ll see how basis functions let us express complex signals as combinations of simple building blocks — just like coordinates in R n.
