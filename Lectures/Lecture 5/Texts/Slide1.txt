Welcome back, everyone. Let me remind you of the best way to get the most out of this course. First, make sure you read the assigned chapter before each lecture. Join the lecture with the preview in mind and listen carefully.  Ask if you have questions proactively. Afterward, work through the homework and revisit the material again. This layered approach — reading, watching, listening, asking, practicing — really helps deepen your understanding.

Today, we’re going to explore a very powerful concept in signal processing: the Fourier series. This topic takes us a step beyond convolution, both in complexity and in importance. It’s a bit more challenging, but it’s absolutely central to many applications in engineering, physics, and medical imaging. So, I’ll do my best to break it down and highlight the key ideas so that you can follow along with confidence.
Let’s get started.
