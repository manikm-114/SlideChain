From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo far, we’ve assumed that the function we’re analyzing is periodic with a period of one. But in real applications, that’s not always the case. The period might be two, five, or even some irrational number like pi. So how do we handle that?\n\nIt turns out the Fourier series still works perfectly—we just need to adjust our formula to account for the actual period, which we’ll call capital T.\nThe idea is simple: we scale the time variable by dividing it by T. That way, we bring the problem back into a familiar form—similar to what we did when the period was one.\n\nSo the Fourier series becomes:\nf of t equals the sum over all n from negative infinity to infinity of c n times e to the power i 2 pi n t over T.\n\nLet me say that again more slowly:\nWe write the function f of t as the sum of c n times e raised to the power i times two pi times n times t divided by T.\nNow what about the coefficients?\nWe compute c n using an integral over one full period. And we have two equivalent options for that:\n\nFirst option:\nc n equals one over T times the integral from zero to capital T of f of t times e to the power negative i 2 pi n t over T, integrated with respect to t.\nOr, second option:\nc n equals one over T times the integral from negative T over 2 to positive T over 2 of f of t times e to the power negative i 2 pi n t over T, again integrated with respect to t.\n\nEither form works. The only difference is the range of integration—whether you go from zero to T or from minus T over 2 to plus T over 2.\n\nSo what’s the takeaway?\nThis is just a change of variable. We're scaling time so that the period becomes one, applying all our previous results, and then scaling back.\n\nThis gives us a general version of the Fourier series that works for any period—not just the special case where the period is one.\nAnd this flexibility is exactly what makes the Fourier series so powerful. It adapts easily to the structure of whatever signal you're analyzing.\nUp next, we’ll take this idea even further and connect it to the Fourier transform, which is what happens when the period becomes infinitely large.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
