From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow that we understand the structure of the Fourier series — with its constant term, cosine terms, and sine terms — the next question is:\u000b\nHow do we actually calculate the coefficients?\nThese coefficients — which we call a n and b n — are essential.\u000bThey tell us exactly how much of each sine or cosine function we need in order to construct the original function.\u000bThink of them like weights — how much of each frequency should be included in our series.\nSo, how do we find them?\n\nThe answer is beautifully simple — we use inner products.\nRemember our earlier discussion: in vector spaces, you can isolate the contribution of a basis vector by projecting onto it.\u000bThe same logic applies here in the world of functions.\u000bBecause sine and cosine functions are orthogonal, we can project the function onto each basis element to extract the corresponding coefficient.\n\nLet’s look at this process in the context of the unit interval — from zero to one.\nFirst, to get the a naught coefficient — that’s the DC or constant component —\u000bwe take the inner product of f of t with the constant function 1.\n\nThis gives us:\na naught over 2 equals the integral from 0 to 1 of f of t d t.\nSo, it’s just the average value of the function over that interval.\nNext, for the cosine coefficients, a n,\u000bwe multiply f of t by the cosine of 2 pi n t, and integrate over the interval from 0 to 1.\u000bThen, we multiply the result by 2.\n\nSo we have:\na n equals 2 times the integral from 0 to 1 of f of t times cosine of 2 pi n t, d t.\nIn the same way, to compute the sine coefficients, b n,\u000bwe do the same thing — but using sine instead of cosine.\n\nSo the formula is:\nb n equals 2 times the integral from 0 to 1 of f of t times sine of 2 pi n t, d t.\nAnd that’s it.\nEach coefficient is computed by projecting the function onto its corresponding basis function — either constant, cosine, or sine.\nThis is the beauty of orthogonality:\u000bEach projection is independent of the others. So we can break the function into clean, non-overlapping components.\nIt’s like using X, Y, and Z axes in 3D space to describe a vector — but here we’re in an infinite-dimensional space, and our axes are made of smooth waveforms.\nNow that we know how to compute these coefficients, we’re ready to apply Fourier series to real examples — and see how they reconstruct signals, even sharp or irregular ones, using only smooth sine and cosine waves.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
