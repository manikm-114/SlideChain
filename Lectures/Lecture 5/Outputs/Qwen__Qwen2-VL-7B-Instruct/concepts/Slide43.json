From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s take a step back now and try to visualize everything we've been talking about.\nWhen we say we’re representing a function using a Fourier series, what does that mean? \n\nWell, it means we’re placing that function inside a kind of infinite-dimensional space. Each dimension in this space corresponds to a different basis function—just like in three-dimensional space, where we have the x, y, and z axes.\nOn the left side of this slide, you see the real basis. These are made up of the constant function 1, the cosine functions like cosine of 2 pi m t, and the sine functions like sine of 2 pi n t. These real functions are all orthonormal, and together, they span the space of all square-integrable periodic functions.\n\nNow notice the red arrow labeled f of t. That red arrow represents a function. And just like any vector in 3D space, we can express this function as a sum of its components in each direction. But in our case, the directions are sine, cosine, and the constant function.\nTo figure out how much of each component is present, we project the function onto each basis function. That’s exactly what we’re doing when we compute the Fourier coefficients. We're just asking: how much of cosine is in this signal? How much of sine? And so on.\n\nNow look at the right-hand diagram. It shows the same idea, but using a complex basis instead. Here, the directions are complex exponentials like e to the i 2 pi n t. These complex exponentials are also orthonormal and form a complete basis in the complex function space.\nThe red arrow here, labeled g of t, could represent the same function as f of t. But now, it’s decomposed using complex components instead of sines and cosines.\nSo whether we use real functions or complex exponentials, the concept is the same: we're decomposing a function into its “directional” components in function space—just like how you decompose a 3D vector into its x, y, and z parts.\n\nThis visualization helps us see Fourier series not just as a bunch of formulas—but as a geometric idea. A function is a vector, and we’re expressing it as a sum of basis vectors.\nThis is the heart of Fourier analysis.\nNext, let’s take a look at some concrete examples to see how this actually plays out in practice.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
