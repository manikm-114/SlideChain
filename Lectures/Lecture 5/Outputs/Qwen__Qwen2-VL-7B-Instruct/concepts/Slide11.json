From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nPreviously, we saw how a vector in three-dimensional space can be represented using its projections onto the x, y, and z axes. Now, let’s extend this same idea to n-dimensional space — using orthogonal basis vectors to represent any arbitrary vector.\n\u000bLet’s quickly review the 3D case first.\u000bWe have three standard unit vectors: along the x-axis, e x equals the vector 1, 0, 0, along the y-axis, e y equals 0, 1, 0, and along the z-axis, e z equals 0, 0, 1.\u000bAny 3D vector — let’s say vector v — with components x, y, and z, can be written as a weighted sum of these basis vectors.\u000bSo, we write: vector v equals v dot e x times e x, plus v dot e y times e y, plus v dot e z times e z.\u000bEach of these terms represents the projection of vector v onto one of the coordinate directions. Because our basis vectors are orthogonal and of unit length, we don’t need to normalize — the inner product directly gives us the component in that direction.\n\nNow let’s generalize to n dimensions.\u000bSuppose we have a vector — we’ll call it vector W — that lives in n-dimensional space. We can express this vector as a linear combination of n orthonormal basis vectors, denoted as e n, where n runs from 1 to capital N.\u000bThe formula looks like this: vector W equals the sum from n equals 1 to capital N of W dot e n times e n.\n\nIn words, for each basis direction e n, we project W onto that direction by computing the inner product W dot e n. That gives us the scalar coefficient for that direction. Then we scale e n by that coefficient and sum everything together.\u000b\nThis is a very powerful idea: you can express any vector — no matter how high the dimension — as a sum of projections onto orthonormal basis vectors.\u000bAnd what’s even more powerful is that those basis vectors don’t have to be just the standard coordinate axes.\u000bThey could be sine and cosine functions, as we use in Fourier series. Or they could be eigenvectors in principal component analysis. Or wavelets, or anything else — as long as they are orthonormal.\u000bSo what we’ve described on this slide is the general framework of orthogonal representation in n-dimensional space. It’s the core mathematical idea that underpins many tools in signal processing, data analysis, and machine learning.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
