From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s now take the next big step in our journey —\u000ba function can actually be treated like a vector.\n\nNow, when you first think about a function — for example, y equals f of x —\u000bYou can imagine a smooth curve on a graph.\u000bAs x changes, you get a continuous stream of y-values,\u000band these values trace out a flowing shape across the domain.\nThat’s the classical view — a function as a curve.\n\u000bBut here’s a shift in perspective that changes everything.\nSuppose you discretize the function.\u000bThat means instead of considering every possible x,\u000byou just pick a few specific values:\u000bx 1, x 2, all the way to x n.\nAt each of these points, you compute the function:\u000bf of x 1, f of x 2, and so on, up to f of x n.\nAnd now you have a finite list of numbers.\u000bThose function values — can be written as a vector.\u000bEach value becomes one component of that vector.\n\nIn the diagram here, you see a red curve — that’s the original function —\u000band below it, green bars showing sample values.\u000bIf we sample the function at 7 locations,\u000bwe can think of those 7 values as a 7-dimensional vector.\nTake more samples — say 700, or 7 million —\u000band the dimension of the vector simply increases.\u000bBut conceptually, it’s still just a point in some high-dimensional space.\n\nSo here’s the key idea:\u000ba function is just a vector — possibly a very high-dimensional one.\u000bAnd that means we can apply all the tools of vector analysis to functions.\u000bWe can talk about the length of a function,\u000bwe can project one function onto another,\u000band we can compute angles between functions,\u000bjust like we did with ordinary vectors in R-n.\nThis insight is exactly what powers Fourier analysis.\u000bIn a Fourier series, we project a function onto a set of orthogonal basis functions —\u000bfunctions like sine and cosine —\u000bjust as we projected ordinary vectors onto coordinate axes.\n\nSo let me leave you with this big takeaway:\nIf a vector is a point,\u000band a function is a vector,\u000bthen a function is also a point —\u000ba point living in a high-dimensional function space.\nThat’s the foundation of what we’ll build next —\u000brepresenting and analyzing functions using the powerful language of vectors.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
