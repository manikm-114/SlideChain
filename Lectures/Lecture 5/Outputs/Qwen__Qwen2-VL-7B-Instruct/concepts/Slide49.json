From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nUp to this point, everything we’ve talked about has been in one dimension. But in real-world applications—especially in imaging—we usually work with two-dimensional data. Think about a photograph, a CT slice, or an MRI frame. These are functions of two variables, not just one.\nSo, does the Fourier series still apply? Absolutely. In fact, the transition to two dimensions is very smooth and intuitive.\n\nLet’s start with the formula at the top. This is the 2D Fourier transform, or more precisely, the 2D discrete Fourier series. It converts a spatial domain function into a frequency domain representation.\n\nWe begin with a function f of m and n. Here, m and n are the spatial coordinates, like pixel row and column indices.\nThen we compute the capital F of x and y, which is the frequency-domain representation of the image. We get it using a double summation—from m equals 0 to M minus 1, and from n equals 0 to N minus 1.\nEach term in the sum includes f of m and n, multiplied by a complex exponential:\u000be to the power negative j 2 pi times x times m over M plus y times n over N.\nThis is just the 2D extension of what we did before in 1D—now applied along both spatial directions.\n\nNext, let’s look at the inverse transform—the formula at the bottom.\nHere, we reconstruct the original image, f of m and n, from its frequency components, F of x and y. Again, we use a double summation ranging from 0 to M minus 1 and N minus 1.\nAnd we add a normalization factor of 1 divided by M times N.\nThe exponential now becomes:\u000be to the power positive j 2 pi times x times m over M plus y times n over N.\n\nSo once again, we’re projecting onto a set of complex exponential basis functions—just like in the 1D case, but now expanded to two dimensions.\nThis idea even extends naturally to three dimensions, which is useful for things like volumetric imaging, 3D scans, or dynamic time-sequence data in medical imaging.\n\nSo to summarize: the 2D Fourier series gives us a powerful way to analyze images in terms of spatial frequencies. It's conceptually the same as the 1D case—just applied in two directions simultaneously.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
