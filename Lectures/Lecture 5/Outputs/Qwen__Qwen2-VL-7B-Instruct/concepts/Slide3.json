From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, let me share what I hope you'll take away from this lecture. We’re going to approach the Fourier series from a geometric perspective, starting with the idea of high-dimensional space. This means thinking about vectors, angles, distances, and inner products — not just in two or three dimensions, but in spaces with many dimensions.\n\nWhen we combine all of these geometric tools, we begin to see Fourier series and Fourier transforms not as abstract formulas, but as structured transformations — transformations that have a clear geometric interpretation.\n\nAnd that’s powerful. Because once you can visualize what’s going on, everything becomes more intuitive. You not only understand the formulas better, but you also remember them more easily. You know what each term is doing. You’re no longer just running code or solving equations without knowing why they work. You can see the big picture. In our last lecture, we talked about linear systems and their behavior in both continuous and discrete settings. \n\nWe introduced convolution and briefly touched on concepts such as the inner product and cross-correlation. Some of you might have found those connections a bit abstract, and that’s completely normal at first. But today, we’ll start bringing those pieces together, using geometry as our guide.\nLet’s dive in.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
