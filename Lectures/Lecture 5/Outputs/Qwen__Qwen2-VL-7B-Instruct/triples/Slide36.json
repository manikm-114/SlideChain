Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nWhen we work with complex numbers, there are two very common ways to describe them:\u000bthe Cartesian form and the polar form.\u000bBoth are fully equivalent, and they each offer a different way of thinking about the same quantity.\n\nLet’s begin with the Cartesian form. This is what we’ve seen already:\u000bA complex number is written as x plus i times y, where x is the real part, and y is the imaginary part.\u000bSo we’re essentially giving the horizontal and vertical coordinates of a point in the complex plane — just like specifying a location on a map.\n\nNow, in engineering, we often replace the symbol i with j to represent the imaginary unit. This is purely to avoid confusion — because in electrical engineering, i is usually reserved for current.\u000bBut mathematically, i and j mean the same thing: they both satisfy the fundamental property that i squared equals negative one.\nThe other way to describe a complex number is through polar coordinates.\u000bInstead of saying how far right and up the point is, we describe the number by its magnitude and angle.\nSo what does that mean?\n\nWe draw a line from the origin to the point — that’s the complex number — and call its length r. That’s the magnitude, or modulus, and it’s calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:\u000br equals the square root of x squared plus y squared.\u000bThis is also written as the absolute value of z.\n\nNext, we describe the angle that line makes with the positive real axis.\u000bThat angle is called theta, and we compute it as the inverse tangent of y over x.\u000bSo now, we have two pieces: r and theta — the magnitude and direction.\nWith that, we can now express the same complex number in polar form.\nIn place of x plus i y, we write:\nr times cosine theta plus i times r sine theta.\u000bOr, factoring out the r:\u000br times the quantity cosine theta plus i sine theta.\n\nThis is the foundation for something beautiful: Euler’s formula, which we’ll talk about in the next slide.\u000bEuler discovered that cosine theta plus i sine theta is equal to e to the i theta — giving us a powerful exponential representation of complex numbers.\nBefore we leave this slide, here’s one more important result:\u000bIf you multiply a complex number by its conjugate — in other words, z times z bar — you get a purely real number.\n\nLet’s walk through it:\u000bz is x plus i y, and its conjugate is x minus i y.\u000bWhen you multiply them together, you get x squared plus y squared, which is just the magnitude squared.\nThis shows that the conjugate cancels out the imaginary part, leaving only a real value — something very useful in analysis and signal processing.\nSo just like vectors, complex numbers let us switch back and forth between rectangular and polar systems.\u000b\nEach form brings its own advantages, and we’ll soon see how this flexibility pays off — especially when we start rewriting Fourier series using complex exponentials.\nLet’s move to Euler’s formula and take this further.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
