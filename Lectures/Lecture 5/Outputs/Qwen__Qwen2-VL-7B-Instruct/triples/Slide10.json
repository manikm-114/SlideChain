Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s focus on a familiar and intuitive case — three-dimensional space.\u000bThis diagram provides a clear geometric visualization that many of you have likely encountered before.\nWe’re looking at a vector — let’s call it vector A — situated in three-dimensional space.\u000bYou can think of vector A as an arrow pointing from the origin to some point in space.\u000b\nAlternatively, you can think of it simply as a collection of coordinates.\nEither way, vector A is completely described by its three components —\u000bx A, y A, and z A —\u000bwhich correspond to its projections along the x, y, and z axes.\n\nNow, here’s the key idea:\u000bEach of these components represents how much vector A \"points\" in the direction of one of the coordinate axes.\nIf you project vector A onto the x-axis, you get x A.\u000bProject it onto the y-axis, and you get y A.\u000bProject it onto the z-axis, and you get z A.\nThis method of description is based on an orthogonal basis,\u000bwhich simply means the axes are all perpendicular to each other —\u000bat right angles.\nAnd here’s the important part:\u000bIf you know x A, y A, and z A,\u000byou have everything you need to reconstruct the entire vector A.\nThat’s because vector A is just the sum of its three projections —\u000beach one scaled by a unit vector in the x, y, or z direction.\n\nMathematically, we write:\u000bvector A equals\u000bx A times i-hat,\u000bplus y A times j-hat,\u000bplus z A times k-hat.\nHere, i-hat is the unit vector along the x-axis,\u000bj-hat is the unit vector along the y-axis,\u000band k-hat is the unit vector along the z-axis.\nThis idea generalizes beautifully to higher dimensions.\u000bInstead of working with x, y, and z,\u000byou’ll have more axes — more basis directions —\u000bbut the principle stays the same.\nAnd here’s where this becomes really exciting:\u000b\nIn Fourier analysis, we do something very similar,\u000bbut instead of projecting onto spatial axes,\u000bwe project onto a set of basis functions —\u000blike sine and cosine waves.\nSo, what you’re seeing here in 3D\u000bis not just about vectors in space.\u000bIt’s the same foundational idea that lets us\u000banalyze and reconstruct complex signals\u000bin the frequency domain.\nUnderstanding this orthogonal representation\u000bsets us up perfectly for the world of Fourier series.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
