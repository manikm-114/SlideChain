Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAnd this brings us to your homework assignment.\n\nFirst, I’d like you to derive the formulas for the Fourier series coefficients using real-valued notation—just like we discussed today. Go through the reasoning step by step, and try to develop some familiarity with the structure of these expressions. Think of it as reinforcing what we’ve covered, not just repeating it.\nSecond, watch the YouTube video linked here, and use it as a guide to implement the square wave example we worked through. This will give you hands-on experience with how the Fourier series behaves—especially when approximating functions with sharp transitions. \n\nThis topic is a bit more involved than convolution, so I recommend reviewing the lecture carefully. But if you get the hang of it, you’ll find the transition to the Fourier transform much smoother in the next lecture.\nGood luck—and see you next time.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"Derive the formulas for the coefficients of the Fourier series in real notations\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\", \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}",
