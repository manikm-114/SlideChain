Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow that we’ve introduced the concept of inner products for complex vectors, let’s take a closer look at how the definition actually works — and more importantly, why it includes a conjugate.\n\nIn a real-valued vector space, things are simple. You multiply corresponding components and sum the results. But in a complex space, if we follow that same rule — just multiplying and summing — we may end up with a complex number. And that’s a problem, because when we’re measuring things like length, or comparing angles between vectors, we need real values.\n\nSo here’s what we do instead.\nWe define the inner product of two complex-valued functions, let’s say f of t and g of t, by integrating the product of f of t and the complex conjugate of g of t.\nSymbolically, we write:\u000b⟨f of t, g of t⟩ equals the integral from minus infinity to infinity of f of t times g star of t, d t.\n\nThat’s our general definition. But often, we work over a specific interval — for example, from zero to one. In that case, we write:\u000b⟨f of t, g of t⟩ equals the integral from 0 to 1 of f of t times g star of t, d t.\n\nNow, why is this conjugation so important?\nWell, imagine taking the inner product of a function with itself. We’d expect that result to be real and non-negative — something that represents the square of the function’s length or its energy. But without the conjugate, we might get a complex number, which doesn’t make physical sense in that context.\nThe conjugate takes care of that. It ensures the phase — or directional twist — of the complex function is canceled out. What’s left is the amplitude — the magnitude — and that’s what we care about when computing lengths or measuring how much two functions align.\n\nAnother way to see this is: the conjugate helps us ignore the phase and focus purely on the size or strength of the signal.\nSo this isn’t just a technical tweak — it’s what makes the geometry of complex spaces work. Thanks to the conjugate, we preserve all the essential properties:\u000borthogonality, projection, the norm — and more.\nSo when we say two complex-valued functions are orthogonal, we mean that their inner product — including the conjugate — is zero. That’s the complex equivalent of vectors being at right angles.\nThis is why conjugates appear everywhere in Fourier analysis and other areas involving complex functions. They ensure consistency and meaning across the entire framework.\n\nSo, to summarize:\u000bIn complex function spaces, an inner product is defined using integration with conjugation.\u000bThat’s the key idea — and it makes everything else fall neatly into place.\nUp next, we’ll use this inner product to compute the complex Fourier coefficients.\nLet’s move forward.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
