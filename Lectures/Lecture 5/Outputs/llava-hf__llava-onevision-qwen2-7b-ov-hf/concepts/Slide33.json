From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s now practically apply this idea — focusing specifically on how we calculate individual Fourier coefficients.\n\nSuppose we want to compute the coefficient b3 from the Fourier series of some known function — say f of t.\nWhat exactly do we do?\nWell, we take the sine function, sine of 2 pi times 3 t, which is one of our orthonormal basis functions, and we compute its inner product with f of t.\u000bThat means we integrate the product of f of t and sine of 2 pi times 3 t over the interval from 0 to 1.\nThat’s it.\u000b\nThe result of this integral is exactly the value of b 3.\u000bNo guessing. No curve fitting. Just a clean calculation using integration.\nAnd this same approach works for any other sine coefficient.\u000bTo compute b n, you use the sine of 2 pi n t as your basis function, multiply it by f of t, and integrate from 0 to 1.\nThe same logic applies to the cosine coefficients — the a n terms.\u000bTo find those, you simply take f of t and compute its inner product with cosine of 2 pi n t.\u000bEach integral gives you one specific Fourier coefficient.\n\nNow why does this work so beautifully?\nIt’s all thanks to the orthonormality of the sine and cosine functions.\nWhen we take an inner product between f of t and any basis function — say, sine of 2 pi times 3 t —\u000bonly the matching sine term in the Fourier expansion contributes to the result.\u000b\nAll the other basis functions — like the cosines, or sine terms with different frequencies — are orthogonal to this one,\u000bso their inner products are zero and they vanish from the computation.\nThis is exactly like projecting a vector in three-dimensional space.\u000b\nIf you want the x-component of a vector, you project it onto the x-axis.\u000bFor the y-component, you project onto the y-axis.\u000bSame idea here — but now, instead of axes, we have sine and cosine waves.\u000bAnd instead of finite dimensions, we’re working in an infinite-dimensional function space.\nSo again, orthonormality makes everything work cleanly.\u000bIt gives us a precise, mathematical way to extract each component of a function in the Fourier basis.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
