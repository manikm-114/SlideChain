From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThis impulse-based thinking becomes especially useful when we move into the world of digital imaging.\nWhen you capture a picture, what you really get is a grid of pixels — discrete samples of brightness or intensity at specific locations. Each pixel can be thought of as a weighted impulse. A brighter pixel contributes more to the image, a darker pixel contributes less. And when the pixel size gets smaller and smaller — approaching zero — you begin to approach the continuous version: the delta function.\n\nSo in this view, an entire image is just a sum of impulses, one per pixel, weighted by intensity.\nAnd this isn’t limited to 2D images.\n\nIn 3D medical imaging, for example, we deal with voxels — volume elements — which are essentially 3D pixels. Again, each voxel corresponds to an impulse in space.\nWhether it’s a 1D signal, a 2D image, or a 3D volume, we can represent the data using impulse-like basis functions. That’s one perspective.\nBut there’s another view — just as powerful — and that involves sinusoidal basis functions.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
