From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s now bring this idea to life with a demonstration.\n\nWhat you’re seeing here is called spectral synthesis — it’s the process of reconstructing a function by adding together sine and cosine waves.\nThe red curve represents the signal or shape we want to recreate. Under the hood, we’re combining multiple sinusoidal components — each one a wave with its own frequency and amplitude.\nAs we begin, the approximation looks rough. But as we add more and more sine and cosine terms — especially ones with higher frequencies — the red curve starts to take shape. We can even mimic sharp edges or jumps, like you see in square waves, just by stacking enough high-frequency components together.\nHere’s what’s important: each sine or cosine wave contributes a specific amount to the final signal. That amount is determined by its amplitude. If we were to graph those contributions — with frequency on the x-axis and amplitude on the y-axis — we’d get what’s known as the Fourier spectrum.\n\nThink of it as the signal’s fingerprint. It tells us exactly how much of each frequency is present in the original function.\n\nThis is the core idea behind one-dimensional Fourier analysis. But it doesn’t stop there. We can extend the same concept to two-dimensional signals, like images — and even to three dimensions, when we’re working with volumes.\nSo what begins as a sum of simple waves turns out to be a powerful way of analyzing and reconstructing complex signals in any dimension.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
