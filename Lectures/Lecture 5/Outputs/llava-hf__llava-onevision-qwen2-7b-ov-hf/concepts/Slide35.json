From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s take a step into the world of complex numbers, because they offer a beautifully compact and powerful way to handle Fourier analysis.\n\nWe begin with something that might feel a little strange at first — the definition of the imaginary unit, denoted by the letter i.\u000b\nBy definition, i squared equals negative one. That is:\ni squared equals minus one.\n\nNow, this seems counterintuitive, right? Because in the world of real numbers, squaring anything always gives you something non-negative. But here, we're stepping beyond the real line, into a new dimension — one that allows us to define numbers that include this imaginary unit.\nAnd that opens the door to complex numbers.\nA complex number, typically written as z, is defined as:\nz = x plus i times y,\nwhere x is the real part, and y is the imaginary part.\u000bGeometrically, you can think of this as a point on the complex plane — with x on the horizontal axis and y on the vertical axis.\nNow, for every complex number, we can define something called its conjugate.\u000bIf z is x plus i times y, then the conjugate of z, written with a bar over it, is:\nx minus I times y.\n\nThis is like flipping the point across the real axis — mirroring it vertically.\nNow, let’s look at how we add and multiply complex numbers.\u000bThe rules are very similar to regular algebra — you just have to remember that i squared is negative one. That’s the only twist.\nSo, for instance, if we add two complex numbers, we just add their real parts and their imaginary parts separately.\u000bIf we multiply them, we expand the product just like you would with binomials — but we substitute i squared with minus one when it appears.\nFrom here, we can also extract the real and imaginary parts of a complex number using its conjugate:\nThe real part is the average of the number and its conjugate — that’s z plus z bar divided by two.\nThe imaginary part is the difference between the number and its conjugate, divided by 2 i.\n\nNow, you might be wondering — how does all this tie back to Fourier analysis?\nWell, just as we defined inner products for real-valued functions, we can do the same for complex-valued functions.\u000bAnd when we do, we often need to deal with conjugates inside integrals.\n\nHere’s the rule:\u000bIf you take the complex conjugate of an integral — say, the integral of f of t times g of t — that’s equal to the integral of f conjugate times g conjugate.\nThis is especially important when we compute energy, projection, or coefficients in complex signal spaces.\n\nAlso, in engineering and physics, we frequently use the star notation — an asterisk — to indicate conjugation. So if you see a star on the outside of an integral, that means we’re conjugating the whole result.\u000bLikewise, when it’s applied to the functions inside, it means we're conjugating those functions individually.\nSo why go through all of this?\nBecause working with complex numbers — especially when combined with Euler’s formula, which we’ll see shortly — allows us to unify sine and cosine into a single, elegant expression. That’s a huge simplification.\n\nAnd that’s the real power of this approach:\u000bCleaner math, fewer terms, and deeper symmetry.\nSo with that, we’re now ready to look at the complex form of the Fourier series, which brings everything we've learned into one compact representation.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
