From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s take everything we’ve learned so far and generalize it to n-dimensional space — what we call “R n,” or more formally, R superscript n.\nSuppose we have two vectors:\u000bVector V has components v i,\u000band vector W has components w i.\n\nThese indices — the little i — run from 1 to n, where n is the number of dimensions.\u000bSo V and W are points in high-dimensional space.\u000bBut just like in two or three dimensions, we can still calculate the distance between them.\n\nThat distance is given by this formula:\u000bD squared of V and W equals the sum over i of v i minus w i, squared.\nThis is just a generalization of the Pythagorean theorem.\n\u000bIn two dimensions, it gives the diagonal of a square.\u000bIn three dimensions, it gives the diagonal of a cube.\u000bIn n dimensions, it gives the straight-line — or Euclidean — distance between two points.\n\nNext, let’s talk about projection — projecting one vector onto the line defined by the other.\u000bFor instance, we can project vector V onto the direction of vector W.\u000bTo do this, we find the scalar value k that minimizes the distance between V and the scaled version of W.\nMathematically, that means minimizing the squared distance —\u000bthe sum over i of v i minus k times w i, squared.\n\nThe optimal value of k — the one that minimizes that distance — is given by:\u000bk equals V dot W, over the norm of W squared.\nThis result comes directly from taking the derivative of the squared distance with respect to k,\u000bsetting it equal to zero, and solving.\u000bAnd look what appears naturally in the formula: the dot product, or inner product.\u000bSo this isn’t a random definition — it’s rooted in geometry.\nThat brings us to another essential concept: angle and orthogonality.\n\nWe can also express the inner product as:\u000bV dot W equals norm of V times norm of W times cosine theta —\u000bwhere theta is the angle between the two vectors.\nSo when theta equals 90 degrees, cosine theta is zero, and the inner product is zero.\u000bThat’s the condition for orthogonality — when vectors are perpendicular.\n\nEven in R n — in any number of dimensions — the inner product continues to define distance, projection, angle, and orthogonality.\u000bThese aren’t just abstract mathematical ideas.\u000bThey are the foundation for understanding how high-dimensional geometry works.\u000bAnd they’re essential tools in areas like signal analysis, data science, and machine learning.\nFinally, don’t forget about basis and dimensionality.\n\u000bIn two dimensions, you need two basis vectors — usually along the x and y axes.\u000bIn n-dimensional space, you need n basis vectors to describe any direction or position fully.\nAnd in our upcoming discussion of Fourier series, we’ll see how basis functions let us express complex signals as combinations of simple building blocks — just like coordinates in R n.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
