From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nBefore that, let’s talk about harmonics — a term you’ve probably heard in music, physics, or signal processing. In the context of Fourier series, harmonics refer to these beautifully smooth sinusoidal components, each oscillating at a different frequency.\nLet’s unpack that.\n\nThe red curve you see here is the first harmonic, or the fundamental frequency. It completes exactly one full oscillation over the interval from 0 to 1. This is what we call the n equals 1 term in the Fourier series.\nNow move down to the blue curve — that’s the second harmonic, where n equals 2. It oscillates twice as fast — so you get two full cycles in the same interval.\nThen the green one, with n equals 3, completes three full oscillations, and so on. As you move further down the harmonic ladder — to n equals 4, n equal 5, and beyond — the frequency keeps increasing, and the wave becomes more and more tightly packed.\n\nThis is the key idea behind the Fourier series: you build complex functions using simple, smooth building blocks. And those blocks are just sine and cosine waves with integer frequencies.\nHere’s something subtle but very important: look at how all these harmonic components start and end at the same value — specifically, at zero. Not only that, but their rate of change — or slope — at the beginning and end is also smoothly matched. That’s what allows them to blend so seamlessly when we stack them.\n\nWhy does this matter?\nBecause when you’re representing a periodic function, you want the end of one period to flow naturally into the start of the next. If there’s a mismatch — either in value or in slope — you get a jump, or a kink, which breaks the smoothness of the function. The harmonics are special because they ensure everything lines up perfectly — not just in position, but in motion.\n\nThat’s why we call these functions harmonic. They don’t just oscillate — they cooperate. And together, they can mimic anything from a square wave to the shape of a human voice, as long as you choose the right amplitudes and phases.\nThis is the genius of Fourier’s insight: no matter how jagged or irregular a periodic signal may appear, you can always think of it as being composed of pure tones — harmonics — each contributing its rhythm to the total pattern.\nAlright, now that we've built some intuition about harmonics, let's move on to the mathematical tools that allow us to compute their coefficients precisely.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
