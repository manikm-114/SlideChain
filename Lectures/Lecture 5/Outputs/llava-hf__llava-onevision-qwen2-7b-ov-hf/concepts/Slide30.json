From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nBefore that, here’s a really elegant and surprisingly powerful idea in mathematical analysis — something that’s often overlooked, but incredibly useful in practice.\nNo matter what function you're dealing with — call it f of x — you can always split it into two parts:\u000ban even part, and an odd part.\n\nAnd here’s how that works.\nWe define the even part, denoted f e of x, as\u000b“f of x plus f of negative x, all divided by two.”\nMathematically, that’s:\u000bf e of x equals one-half times the sum of f of x and f of minus x.\nIf you plug in negative x into this expression, you’ll get:\u000bf e of minus x equals one-half times f of minus x plus f of x —\u000bwhich is exactly the same as f e of x.\u000bSo this part is symmetric — it satisfies the condition of an even function.\n\nThen, we define the odd part, written as f o of x,\u000bby subtracting instead of adding. So you get:\u000bf o of x equals one-half times f of x minus f of negative x.\nNow, if you evaluate this at negative x, you’ll find that:\u000bf o of negative x equals negative f o of x.\u000bThat’s the signature of an odd function — it’s antisymmetric about the origin.\n\nSo here’s the beauty:\u000bEvery function, no matter how it looks, can be written as the sum of its even and odd parts.\nIn other words,\u000bf of x equals f e of x plus f o of x.\nThis is a universal decomposition — and it's not just a neat identity.\u000b\nIt plays a critical role in understanding symmetry in signals, especially in Fourier analysis, where even and odd functions relate directly to cosine and sine components, respectively.\nSo remember this trick.\u000bWhenever you’re working with a function — especially in signal processing or image analysis — it’s often helpful to ask:\u000bWhat’s its even part? What’s its odd part?\u000bAnd how can we take advantage of that symmetry?\nWe’ll put this idea to use shortly when we calculate the Fourier coefficients.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
