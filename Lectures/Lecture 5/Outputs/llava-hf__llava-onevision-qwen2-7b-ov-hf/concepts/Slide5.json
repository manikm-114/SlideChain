From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s now revisit the concept of a shift-invariant linear system, which we introduced earlier in the course. This diagram gives us a step-by-step breakdown of how such systems behave — and how the inner product plays a central role.\n\nHere’s the key idea: once you're given the impulse response of a system — that is, how it reacts to a single impulse — and you know the system is both linear and shift-invariant, then you can compute the system’s output for any input signal.\nThis is exactly where convolution comes into play.\n\nAs shown in the diagram, the input signal x of n can be represented as a weighted sum of shifted delta functions.\u000bThat is, x of n equals the sum over k, from negative infinity to infinity, of x of k times delta of n minus k.\n\nNow, for each of those shifted deltas — delta of n minus k — the system responds with a shifted impulse response:\u000bh of n minus k.\nAnd this response is scaled by the input value at that shift, which is x of k.\n\nSo what do we do next?\n\u000bWe add up all those scaled responses. The result is:\u000bx of n equals the sum over k, from minus infinity to infinity, of x of k times h of n minus k.\nThat’s the standard convolution formula.\n\nBut here’s what’s really important:\u000bWhen you compute the convolution at a particular time n, you are essentially performing an inner product.\nYou take the input signal and the flipped, shifted impulse response — multiply them element by element — and sum the result.\n\u000bThis process is just like computing the dot product of two vectors.\nThis same concept is used in matched filtering — like in radar signal processing.\n\u000bIn this process, we take a known pattern — which we refer to as the filter — and slide it across the incoming signal.\u000bWhen the filter aligns well with a portion of the signal, the inner product reaches a maximum value.\u000bThis peak indicates that a strong match has been detected.\n\nWhether we call it convolution or cross-correlation, the operation always boils down to computing inner products.\nSo once again, the inner product isn’t just a nice-to-have mathematical idea.\u000bIt is the fundamental engine behind convolution, filtering, correlation, and soon, our study of Fourier analysis.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
