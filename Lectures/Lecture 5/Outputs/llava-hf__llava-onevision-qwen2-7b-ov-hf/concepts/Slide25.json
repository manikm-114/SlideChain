From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s now begin our exploration of Fourier series by focusing on a special class of functions: periodic functions.\nA periodic function is one that repeats itself over and over again at regular intervals. Formally, we say that a function f of x is periodic if there exists a value — which we call the period, and usually denote with capital P — such that:\nf of x plus P equals f of x, for all values of x.\nThis repeating behavior is what allows us to use the Fourier series to represent such functions.\nTake a look at the top plot in this slide. It shows a one-dimensional example of a periodic function. It doesn't need to be a perfect sine or cosine wave — the key idea is that it repeats exactly after a fixed horizontal interval. In this case, that interval is P units.\n\nNow look at the image below it. That’s a real-world example — a two-dimensional periodic pattern. Patterns like this are common in materials science, digital imaging, or even textures. You can see how the structure repeats itself in both the horizontal and vertical directions — that’s spatial periodicity in two dimensions.\nSo what is our goal?\n\nWe want to understand how any periodic function — no matter how smooth, jagged, or irregular — can be represented as a sum of sine and cosine waves.\nThis is the heart of the Fourier series. Even if a function looks complicated, we can rebuild it precisely by combining a collection of smooth sinusoidal waves — each with its own frequency, amplitude, and phase.\n\nAnd here’s the beautiful part:\u000bIf we get just one period of the function right, the rest of the function falls into place, because it's simply repetition.\nSo moving forward, we’ll first focus on periodic functions in one dimension. We’ll go through the math, develop the intuition, and build the full Fourier series representation. Then, once we understand that, we’ll extend the same ideas to two-dimensional cases, and even three dimensions — which is especially useful for signals, images, and medical data.\nLet’s now dive into the mathematics and see how it all comes together.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
