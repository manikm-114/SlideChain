From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s take a moment now to understand what happens when we approximate a function using only a finite number of Fourier terms.\nIn theory, the Fourier series uses infinitely many sine or complex exponential terms to exactly reconstruct the original function. But in practice, we can only sum up a limited number of them. So what does that mean?\n\nWell, in regions where the function is smooth and continuous, like in the middle of a flat section of the square wave, the approximation is excellent. The series follows the shape of the function very closely, and the error becomes negligible as we include more terms.\nBut notice what happens at the discontinuities—those sudden jumps where the function goes from 1 to 1. That’s where the series begins to struggle.\n\nIf you look at the plot here, you’ll see a ripple near each jump. These ripples don’t go away even if we add more and more terms. This phenomenon is known as the Gibbs phenomenon, and we’ll explore it in detail shortly.\nFor now, focus on what the formula in the blue box is telling us. It describes the value that the Fourier series converges to at each point x.\nIf the function f of x is continuous at that point, then the Fourier series converges to f of x. That’s simple enough.\nBut if the function is discontinuous, then the series converges to the average of the left-hand and right-hand limits. Mathematically, that means:\nS of x equals one-half times f of x from the left, plus f of x from the right\n\nSo the series doesn’t “miss” the function entirely at the jump—it just lands at the midpoint. This is a subtle but important point: the Fourier series always converges to something, and that something is precisely defined.\nIn summary, finite Fourier series work very well across most of the domain, but they introduce oscillations and errors around jumps. That’s an inherent limitation of this type of approximation—and next, we’ll give this behavior a name and look more closely at its mathematical structure.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
