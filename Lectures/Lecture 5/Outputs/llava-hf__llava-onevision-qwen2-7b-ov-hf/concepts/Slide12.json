From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow here’s a very important point — and one that’s often overlooked.\u000bA basis is not unique.\n\nLet’s begin with a simple analogy in two-dimensional space.\u000bIn most problems, we use the standard coordinate system — with one unit vector along the x-axis and one along the y-axis.\u000bIn that system, the basis vectors are: 1, 0 for the x-direction, and 0, 1 for the y-direction.\nBut now imagine we rotate the coordinate system by some angle — let’s call it phi.\u000b\nAfter this rotation, we have a new set of axes — shown in red on the diagram.\u000bThese new axes define a new basis, one that’s rotated by the angle phi.\u000bAnd here’s the key: this rotated basis is just as valid as the original one.\nEvery point in the plane can still be represented using the new basis.\u000bThe point hasn’t moved — only the coordinate system has changed.\u000bSo the coordinates of the point relative to the new axes will be different, but the underlying geometry is the same.\nMathematically, the new coordinates, which we’ll call x-prime and y-prime, are computed from the original coordinates x and y using this rotation:\u000bx-prime equals x times cosine phi, plus y times sine phi.\u000by-prime equals negative x times sine phi, plus y times cosine phi.\n\nIn matrix form, this looks like:\u000bopcosine phi, sine phi; negative sine phi, cosine phi,\nThis is a classic rotation matrix — it rotates vectors by an angle phi in the plane.\nAnd this concept generalizes beautifully.\u000bIn three dimensions, you can rotate about the x-axis, the y-axis, or the z-axis, producing new orthogonal bases in each case.\u000bYou can also use combinations of these rotations — just like the lower diagram shows — rotating around alpha, beta, and gamma angles.\nAnd in n-dimensional space, the same principle applies.\u000b\nSo what’s the takeaway?\u000bThe basis you choose to describe vectors is not fixed.\u000bYou can rotate it, change it, or switch to one that better fits the problem.\u000bThis is especially useful in Fourier analysis, where we don’t just rotate axes — we build entirely new bases, like sine and cosine functions, to describe signals more effectively.\nSo while the geometry remains unchanged, the coordinate description of a point — or a signal — depends on the basis you choose.\u000bThat’s the power of flexible, non-unique bases in linear algebra and signal processing.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
