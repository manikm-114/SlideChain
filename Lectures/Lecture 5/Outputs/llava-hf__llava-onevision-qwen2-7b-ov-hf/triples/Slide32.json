Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s now walk through a concrete example to see how Fourier coefficients are actually computed in practice.\n\nSuppose you’re interested in finding a particular coefficient from the Fourier series — let’s say the coefficient b 3.\u000bThis is the number that scales the sine term with frequency 3 — in other words, sine of 2 pi times 3 t.\n\nSo the question is:\u000bHow much of this specific sine wave is present in the function f of t?\nTo answer this, we use a technique we've now seen several times — the inner product.\n\nHere’s what we do:\u000bWe take the inner product of f of t with sine of 2 pi times 3 t.\nNow keep in mind — this sine function is one of our basis elements.\u000bIt’s a fixed, known waveform. The function f of t is the one we’re analyzing.\u000bAnd because the basis functions are orthonormal, a wonderful thing happens:\n\nWhen we take this inner product, it acts like a filter.\nIt scans across the entire Fourier series of f of t, and picks out just the piece that exactly matches sine of 2 pi times 3 t.\nAll the other terms — the constant term, the cosine terms, and the sine terms with different frequencies like\u000bsine of 2 pi t, or sine of 2 pi times 2 t, or sine of 2 pi times 4 t —\u000ball of those vanish. Their inner products are zero, because they’re orthogonal to sine of 2 pi times 3 t.\nThe only term that survives is the one we care about — the one that involves b 3.\nSo this inner product tells us, precisely and cleanly, what b 3 must be.\nAnd this isn’t just a lucky trick.\u000b\nIt’s a fundamental feature of the Fourier basis —\u000bOrthogonality ensures that each coefficient can be extracted independently, with no interference from the others.\nIn short:\u000bTo find any Fourier coefficient — whether it’s a n or b n —\u000bYou simply project the function onto the corresponding sine or cosine basis function.\u000bThat’s it.\nAnd this is what makes the Fourier series so powerful.\u000bIt gives us a systematic, elegant way to peel apart the frequency content of a signal — one layer at a time.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
