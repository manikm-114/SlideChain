Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThis impulse-based thinking becomes especially useful when we move into the world of digital imaging.\nWhen you capture a picture, what you really get is a grid of pixels — discrete samples of brightness or intensity at specific locations. Each pixel can be thought of as a weighted impulse. A brighter pixel contributes more to the image, a darker pixel contributes less. And when the pixel size gets smaller and smaller — approaching zero — you begin to approach the continuous version: the delta function.\n\nSo in this view, an entire image is just a sum of impulses, one per pixel, weighted by intensity.\nAnd this isn’t limited to 2D images.\n\nIn 3D medical imaging, for example, we deal with voxels — volume elements — which are essentially 3D pixels. Again, each voxel corresponds to an impulse in space.\nWhether it’s a 1D signal, a 2D image, or a 3D volume, we can represent the data using impulse-like basis functions. That’s one perspective.\nBut there’s another view — just as powerful — and that involves sinusoidal basis functions.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"s\": \"pixel\",\n      \"p\": \"represents\",\n      \"o\": \"picture element\",\n      \"modalities\": [\n        \"text\",\n        \"image\"\n      ],\n      \"confidence\": 0.95,\n      \"evidence\": \"Pixel: Picture Element\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"s\": \"pixel\",\n      \"p\": \"represents\",\n      \"o\": \"weighted impulse\",\n      \"modalities\": [\n        \"text\"\n      ],\n      \"confidence\": 0.9,\n      \"evidence\": \"Each pixel can be thought of as a weighted impulse.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"s\": \"voxel\",\n      \"p\": \"represents\",\n      \"o\": \"volume element\",\n      \"modalities\": [\n        \"text\"\n      ],\n      \"confidence\": 0.9,\n      \"evidence\": \"voxels — volume elements — which are essentially 3D pixels.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
