Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s now return to the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, but this time through a more intuitive, geometric lens.\nEarlier, we explored the algebraic version. Now, let’s visualize what it really means. \n\nImagine two vectors, A and B, drawn as arrows in space. The inner product between them — also called the dot product — can be expressed as:\n\u000bA dot B equals norm of A times norm of B times cosine of the angle theta between them.\nNow, keep in mind: cosine theta is always between minus one and plus one. So unless theta is exactly zero degrees — which means the vectors are pointing in the exact same direction — the inner product is always strictly less than the product of the magnitudes. That’s why the inequality holds.\nBut what about equality? \n\nWell, equality happens when cosine theta is equal to one. In other words, when theta equals zero. Geometrically, that means vector A lies perfectly along the line defined by vector B. One vector is simply a scaled version of the other.\n\nIn mathematical terms, we say:\u000bbi divided by ai equals c, for all values of i.\n\u000bThis means each component of B is a constant multiple of the corresponding component of A.\nThat constant, c, tells us how much we stretch or shrink vector A to get to vector B. When that relationship holds for every component, the two vectors are not only aligned — they are perfectly aligned, differing only in length.\nThis concept is extremely useful in signal processing. Take matched filtering, for example. Imagine you transmit a radar pulse. That pulse travels, reflects off an object — say, an airplane — and comes back. Because of factors like distance or material type, the return signal may be delayed or weakened, but its shape stays the same.\n\nSo how do we detect it?\nWe use cross-correlation. That means we slide the known signal over the incoming data and measure how similar they are. When the alignment is strongest — that is, when the cross-correlation reaches its peak — the two signals are most similar in shape.\nThis is where the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality comes in. When two signals align perfectly, their inner product is maximized. Cosine theta approaches one. That tells us: these vectors — or signals — are almost perfectly matched.\n\nSo this triangle diagram isn't just a piece of geometry. It’s a powerful mental image that shows how the inner product captures alignment. And equality — the case when the inequality becomes an equality — only happens when vectors point exactly in the same direction. Whether you're in two dimensions, three dimensions, or even much higher-dimensional space — the story remains the same.\nThat’s the geometric heart of the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
