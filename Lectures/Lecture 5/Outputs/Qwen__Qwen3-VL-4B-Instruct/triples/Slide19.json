Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSine and cosine waves show up everywhere in nature —\u000band there's a beautiful reason for that.\u000bThey arise naturally from circular motion.\nLet’s take a simple example.\n\u000bImagine a point moving in a perfect circle —\u000blike the moon orbiting the Earth at constant speed.\n\nNow, if you shine a light on that motion\u000band watch the shadow it casts onto a flat surface —\u000bsay, the x-axis —\u000bwhat do you get?\nYou get a sine wave.\nThat’s right —\u000bas the point moves around the circle,\u000bits horizontal position follows a smooth wave.\u000bThat’s sine.\nAnd if you project onto the y-axis instead,\u000byou get a cosine wave.\n\nSo these waveforms — sine and cosine —\u000bare really just the shadows of circular motion.\nThat’s a profound idea.\n\u000bIt tells us that sine and cosine functions\u000baren’t just mathematical inventions —\u000bthey’re embedded in the geometry and physics of the real world.\nThey describe how things rotate, how waves travel,\u000bhow springs vibrate, how light and sound move.\nAnd because of this,\u000bsine and cosine waves form the foundation of something\u000bwe’ll explore in depth — the Fourier series.\n\nSo far, we’ve seen two major ways to represent functions:\nFirst, as a sum of impulses —\u000blike tiny samples or pixel points in space.\nAnd now, as a sum of sinusoids —\u000bwaves that capture how a signal behaves across frequencies.\nBoth perspectives are incredibly powerful.\u000bThey help us describe, analyze, and reconstruct data\u000bin ways that are both mathematically precise and physically meaningful.\n\nIn the next section, we’ll dive into how\u000bthese sine and cosine functions can be used\u000bas a basis to build any function you like —\u000bjust like we built vectors from orthogonal components.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
