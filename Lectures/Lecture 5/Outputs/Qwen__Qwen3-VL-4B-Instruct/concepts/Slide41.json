From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s take a moment now to fully understand what we mean by an orthonormal basis, especially when we’re working with complex exponentials.\n\nWe define a family of functions—denoted e n of t—where each function is written as:\u000b  \"e to the power two pi i n t.\"\u000bHere, n is any integer, and t is in the interval from zero to one.\u000b\nNow, to confirm that these functions actually form an orthonormal basis, we’ll compute the inner product between two of them. Let’s say we have e n t and e m t, and n is not equal to m.\nSince we’re in a complex function space, remember that we have to conjugate the second function when we compute the inner product.\u000bSo, the inner product between e n and e m is:\u000b  \"The integral from zero to one of e to the two pi i n t, times the complex conjugate of e to the two pi i m t.\"\u000b\nNow, taking the conjugate of an exponential just flips the sign in the exponent. So this product becomes:\u000b  \"e to the power two pi i times the quantity n minus m, all times t.\"\u000bWe’re now integrating this from zero to one.\u000bWhat happens?\nWell, if n is not equal to m, this exponential is rotating in the complex plane over the entire interval, and the total contribution over one period averages out to zero.\u000bSo, in that case, the inner product is zero. This confirms that the functions are orthogonal when n and m are different.\u000b\n\nNow, what if n equals m?\u000bThen the exponent becomes zero, so we’re simply integrating the constant function one, from zero to one. That gives us a value of one.\u000bSo this confirms that the functions are normalized when n equals m.\u000bPutting both of these observations together, we have the classic orthonormality condition:\u000b  \"The inner product of e n and e m is equal to one if n equals m, and zero otherwise.\"\u000bThat’s exactly what we expect from an orthonormal basis.\n\nThese complex exponential functions form the mathematical backbone of the Fourier series. Each function is like a “building block” that carries a particular frequency, and together they allow us to represent almost any function on the interval from zero to one.\u000bThis structure is elegant, efficient, and deeply powerful.\u000bAnd in the next step, we’ll use these building blocks to express the complex form of the Fourier series.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
