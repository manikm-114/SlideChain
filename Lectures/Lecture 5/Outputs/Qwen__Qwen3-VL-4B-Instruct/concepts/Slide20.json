From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s now take a closer look at the sinusoidal basis — especially the sine and cosine functions.\n\nIn the plot, the red curve represents the sine of x — written as sine x — and the green curve shows the cosine of x.\nThere’s a key difference in their symmetry. Cosine is an even function. That means if you reflect it across the vertical axis — the y-axis — it stays the same. In other words, the cosine of negative x equals the cosine of x.\n\nSine, on the other hand, is an odd function. That means it’s symmetric about the origin. So the sine of negative x equals the negative sine of x.\nBut here’s something subtle. Whether a function is “even” or “odd” actually depends on where you place the origin. If you shift your coordinate system, the symmetry can change. So this classification is based on our point of view — not an absolute property of the function.\n\nNow here’s the deeper idea: sine and cosine functions together form an orthogonal basis. That means you can use them to represent any reasonable function — just like we previously used delta functions or unit vectors.\nThis sets the stage for a powerful idea: instead of expressing a function as a sum of impulses, like a series of spikes, we can express it as a sum of waves — smooth, continuous, sinusoidal components.\nAnd that’s exactly what we’ll explore next through the lens of the Fourier series.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
