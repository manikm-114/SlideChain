From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSeems like we are going as per our schedule.\n\nIn some courses or textbooks, you might be handed a formula for Fourier analysis and told to apply it mechanically. And sure — you might be able to follow the steps, plug in numbers, and get the right answer. But that kind of approach often leaves you without a real understanding of what’s happening under the hood.\n\nHere, we’re going to do things differently. Instead of just giving you the equations, we’ll take the time to explore the why and how behind them. What does the Fourier series represent? Why does it work? And how does it help us understand complex signals?\n\nThis deeper understanding is especially important in a field like medical imaging, where you’re not just solving math problems — you’re working with real-world data that affects real people. So, our goal is not just to teach you the tools, but to help you develop a solid intuition for how and why they work.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
