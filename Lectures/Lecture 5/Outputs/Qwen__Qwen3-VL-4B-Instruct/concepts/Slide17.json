From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s now revisit a powerful concept —\u000brepresenting a function as a sum of impulses.\nHere’s the idea:\u000bInstead of describing a function as one smooth continuous curve,\u000bwe break it down into a series of impulses, or spikes.\nEach impulse is a shifted delta function —\u000bmeaning, a very narrow spike placed at a specific time location.\n\u000bWe scale each spike by the height of the function at that point.\u000bIn other words, the amplitude of the spike equals the value of f of t\u000bat that specific time t.\nSo we’re essentially saying:\u000bf of t equals the sum of delta functions,\u000beach multiplied by f at that location.\n\nLook at the diagram.\u000bThe smooth gray curve represents the original function,\u000band the red arrows show the delta spikes.\u000bEach spike points straight up, and its height\u000bmatches the value of the function at that moment.\n\nNow, if you add all of these weighted impulses together —\u000byou recover the entire shape of the original function.\nThis construction gives us a complete basis in one dimension.\u000bAnd we can take this idea further.\nIn two dimensions, we use impulses defined over x and y.\u000bThink of image pixels — each pixel acts like a 2D delta function,\u000bplaced at a specific location and scaled by intensity.\nIn three dimensions — like with medical images or 3D scans —\u000bwe build the signal from tiny volume elements, or voxels.\u000bEach voxel is just an impulse located at some point in 3D space,\u000bscaled by the value of the function there.\n\nSo no matter the dimensionality —\u000bone D, two D, or three D —\u000byou can think of a signal, image, or volume\u000bas being built from a grid of impulses.\nEach impulse contributes a small piece of the whole.\u000bAnd together, they form the complete function.\nThat’s the power of thinking in terms of delta functions —\u000bthey give us a clean, mathematical way to build up\u000bany function from the ground up, piece by piece.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
