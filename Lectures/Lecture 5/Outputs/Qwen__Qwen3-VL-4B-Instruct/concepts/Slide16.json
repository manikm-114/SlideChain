From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nWe’ve talked a lot about vectors — and how to compute their inner product\u000bby multiplying corresponding components and then adding them up.\u000bThat’s the basic operation in vector space.\n\nMathematically, for vectors A and B, the inner product is written as:\u000bA dot B equals the sum from i equals minus infinity to infinity\u000bof a i times b i.\n\nNow, let’s extend this idea to functions.\u000bIn functional space, instead of dealing with discrete components,\u000bwe’re dealing with continuous values defined over time or space.\nSo, instead of a summation, we use an integral.\u000bThe inner product of two functions, A of t and B of t, is defined as the integral from minus infinity to infinity\u000bof A of t times B of t, d t.\nThat’s our functional equivalent of the vector dot product.\u000bThe interpretation is exactly the same:\u000bwe’re measuring how much two signals align —\u000bwhether they point in similar directions in an infinite-dimensional space.\n\nNow here comes the big question:\u000bCan we find a basis for functions, just like we do in vector spaces?\nAnd the answer is yes.\u000bOne powerful basis uses something called the Dirac delta function —\u000bwritten as delta of x minus a.\n\nLet me explain.\nThere’s a key identity in signal processing that says:\u000bf of t equals the integral from minus infinity to infinity\u000bof delta of tau minus t, times f of tau, d tau.\n\nWhat does this mean?\nWell, the delta function is like a mathematical spike —\u000bIt’s zero everywhere, except at a single point.\u000bSo when we multiply f of tau by delta of tau minus t,\u000bWe’re isolating the value of f right at tau equals t.\u000bAnd by integrating over all tau, we’re reconstructing the full function\u000bby sweeping this spike across the domain.\nThink of it this way:\u000beach delta function — centered at a point a —\u000bacts like a basis vector.\u000bAnd each one is scaled by f of a —\u000bthe value of the function at that location.\nThis is just like saying:\u000bv equals v one times e one plus v two times e two, and so on.\nSo yes, even in this continuous, infinite-dimensional space,\u000bwe’re still using the same principle:\u000bBasis functions times coefficients gives you the full object.\nAnd this paves the way for what’s coming next —\u000bFourier series, where instead of spikes,\u000bwe’ll use smooth, oscillating waves as our basis functions.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
