From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow that we’ve built the full foundation, we’re finally ready to write down the complex form of the Fourier series.\u000bInstead of expressing our function f of t using separate sine and cosine terms, we now use complex exponentials as the basis functions. And the result is both beautiful and powerful.\u000bWe write:\u000b\"f of t equals the sum, from n equals negative infinity to positive infinity, of c n times e to the power i two pi n t.\"\u000bSo here, each term in the sum is a complex sinusoid at frequency n. And the corresponding coefficient, c n, tells us how much of that frequency is present in the signal.\u000b\nNow, how do we find each coefficient?\u000bBecause our basis functions are orthonormal, we can isolate any one coefficient simply by taking the inner product of f with the exponential function e to the i two pi n t. That gives us:\u000b\"c n equals the inner product of f of t and e to the i two pi n t,\"\u000b\"which equals the integral from zero to one of f of t times e to the negative i two pi n t, with respect to t.\"\u000bNotice here that minus sign in the exponent. That comes from taking the complex conjugate inside the inner product.\u000bThis formula is incredibly useful—it gives us a direct way to compute each coefficient without interference from the others.\u000b\nNow, if you recall the real Fourier series with cosine and sine terms, and if you rewrite cosine and sine using Euler’s formulas, and substitute them back into the real series, you’ll get the same expression—but now in terms of complex exponentials.\u000bAnd the coefficients come out as:\u000bFor non-zero n,\u000b\"c n equals a n over two, minus i times b n over two.\"\u000bFor n equals zero,\u000b\"c zero equals a zero over two.\"\u000b\nSo the complex coefficients still capture the exact same information as a n, b n, and a naught—but now in a more compact and unified form.\u000bAnd finally, if your function f of t is real-valued, then the Fourier coefficients have a special property called conjugate symmetry. That is:\u000b\"The complex conjugate of c n equals c negative n.\"\u000bThis symmetry ensures that when you sum the exponentials—both positive and negative frequencies—the imaginary parts cancel out, and you’re left with a real-valued function.\u000b\nSo to summarize, this complex form of the Fourier series gives us a cleaner expression, easier computation, and a deeper insight into the structure of signals. It’s no surprise this form is central in many areas, from signal processing to quantum mechanics.\u000bNext, we’ll build on this to explore how these complex exponentials serve as building blocks for signal decomposition and frequency-domain analysis.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
