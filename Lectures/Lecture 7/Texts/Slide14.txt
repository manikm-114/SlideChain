Now that we’ve seen why digital signals are so useful, let’s take a look at how real-world signals actually make their way into a computer.
This diagram shows the full journey — from a physical system to digital data inside your laptop.

Let’s walk through it step by step.
It all starts with the physical world — maybe we’re measuring temperature, pressure, light intensity, motion, or some other physical quantity.

To capture this, we need a sensor — or more specifically, a transducer.A transducer converts the physical phenomenon into an electrical signal — usually an analog one.This analog signal may be noisy, or it may contain extra fluctuations we don’t want.

So the next step is called signal conditioning.Here we might filter the signal, smooth it, amplify it, or perform other adjustments to get it into a clean, usable form.This step helps us reduce noise and make sure the signal is suitable for the next stage.

Now comes the critical component — the Analog-to-Digital Converter, or A-D converter for short.
This is where the continuous analog signal gets sampled and turned into a digital signal — a sequence of numbers the computer can store and process.

More specifically, to get a analog signal into the computer, let’s break down what happens during digitization with an A/D converter — using this visual example.

Here you see an analog signal, represented here as a smooth, continuous wave — like a sound wave moving across time.Actually, a digital computer can’t store this continuous curve directly.Instead, it must sample the signal at specific time points.

At each of these time points, we ask:What is the value of the signal right here?And that gives us a sequence of numbers.
In the rightmost illustration, you can see vertical bars that “catch” the wave at regular intervals.These bars represent sampling operations — and the height of each bar shows the value of the signal at that point in time.

Now, here's something important:The computer can’t store every possible value — like pi=3.14159 etc. or e=2.71828 etc. with infinite precision.Instead, it must round the values to the nearest available level.
This process is called quantization.It means converting a smooth, continuous range of amplitudes into a set of fixed, discrete values — often represented by whole numbers.

So here, we get a string of numbers like:3, 5, 6, 6, 4, 2, 1, 2.
And these numbers are what the computer stores.
But even these whole numbers aren’t stored in decimal form.Computers use binary — just zeros and ones to represent either an integral or a decimal number.

So each number gets translated into binary. For example:
1 becomes zero one,
2 becomes one zero,
3 becomes one one,
and so on.
This is how a continuous analog signal — like sound or temperature — becomes a digital signal inside a computer:First through sampling across time, then through quantization of amplitude, and finally through binary encoding.

Each step introduces a tradeoff:
More sampling points give better resolution in time.
More quantization levels give better precision in amplitude.
But more of both means more data to store and process.
This is the foundation of digital signal processing — and now you’ve seen how it all begins.

And finally, that digital data — made up of zeros and ones — enters the computer, where it can be displayed, analyzed, stored, or transmitted.

So again, the pipeline goes like this:
Physical system → transducer → signal conditioning → analog-to-digital conversion → computer.
This entire process happens in almost every modern system — from medical devices to smart homes to autonomous vehicles.
And the better we understand this chain, the better we can design systems that are accurate, efficient, and reliable.
