Let’s revisit the convolution theorem — this time with a concrete visual example to help reinforce the idea.
This theorem is incredibly important, and we’ll keep coming back to it.So it's essential to get comfortable with how it works — both mathematically and visually.

Let’s look at what we have here.
In the top row, we see three time-domain signals:
On the left is f of x, a simple rectangular function, also known as a gate function, centered at zero and extending from minus b over 2 to plus b over 2.
In the middle is h of x, which consists of two delta functions — located symmetrically around zero at minus a over 2 and plus a over 2.
On the right is the result of the convolution of f and h — which we’ll call g of x.

Now remember:When you convolve a function with a delta, the result is simply a shifted version of that function.
So here, convolving the gate function f of x with each of the two deltas in h of x gives us two shifted gate functions — one shifted left and one shifted right.
When we add them together, we get g of x — a pair of rectangular pulses.
Now let’s look at the bottom row — this is the frequency domain.
Here’s where the convolution theorem comes in.

According to the theorem:
Convolution in the time domain becomes multiplication in the frequency domain.
So we take the Fourier transforms of the three signals:
f of x becomes capital F of k, which is a sinc-shaped curve — smooth and localized in frequency.
h of x, which had two deltas in time, becomes a cosine wave in the frequency domain — that’s capital H of k, centered at zero, with oscillations depending on the spacing of the deltas.

Now, to get capital G of k, we multiply the two frequency-domain functions:
Capital F of k times capital H of k equals capital G of k.
And the result, shown on the right, is a modulated sinc — essentially the original sinc shape, but with oscillations introduced by the cosine multiplier.

So the key takeaway is this:
In time, the convolution added and shifted the pulses.
In frequency, the multiplication mixed the smooth sinc shape with oscillations.
This is a perfect visual illustration of what the convolution theorem does:
It transforms an operation that involves sliding and summing in time into a much simpler pointwise multiplication in the frequency domain.
Understanding this duality will help you immensely when working with signals — whether in analysis, filtering, or system design.
