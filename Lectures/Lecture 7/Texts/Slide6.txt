Now, let’s step back for a moment and ask a deeper question: Why does the convolution theorem work the way it does? What makes it so special?

In the last lecture, I mentioned something that gives us a clue.If you have a shift-invariant linear system, and you input a sinusoidal signal, what comes out is also a sinusoid, and — importantly — at the same frequency.
That’s a big deal.
It means the system doesn't generate any new frequencies. It doesn’t distort the sinusoid into some other shape. It simply scales it or shifts its phase — but the frequency stays the same.
This is a unique and powerful property of sinusoids.

Now let’s think about what that means for convolution and Fourier analysis.
In time-domain analysis, convolution is the operation that describes how a system responds to an input.
But if your input and your system are both described using sinusoids, and those sinusoids don’t change frequency, then it turns out convolution becomes multiplication in the Fourier domain.

Why?
Because in the Fourier domain, every signal is broken into sinusoids. And if each one stays intact — same frequency in, same frequency out — then multiplying their responses is all you need to compute the system output.
That’s exactly what the convolution theorem says:Convolution in time equals multiplication in frequency.
But — and this is important — this beautiful relationship only works because of the special behavior of sinusoids.
If your input signal isn’t made of sinusoids, or your system doesn’t treat them nicely, this property breaks down.
That’s why this theorem only exists for the Fourier transform, which is based entirely on sinusoids.Other transforms — like wavelets or polynomials — don’t have this same "in equals out" behavior, and so they don’t give us a convolution theorem in the same way.

If you’re curious, I actually encourage you to think about this more. You could even write a short paper or a reflection on it.
Here’s something to try:
Try proving that if a function goes into a system and the same form comes out — unchanged except for amplitude and phase — then that function must be a sinusoid.

And also prove the related idea:If sinusoids go in and come out with the same frequency, then convolution in time must match multiplication in frequency.
These are two different ideas — but together, they give us the foundation for the convolution theorem and explain why Fourier analysis is so powerful for linear systems.
