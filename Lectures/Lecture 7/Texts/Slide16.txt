Now, let’s go back and revisit the question we just posed:If we take a continuous signal and convert it into discrete samples, can we still reconstruct the original signal?
To explore that, let’s start with this example — a pure continuous wave.

Here, we’ve plotted the function5 times sine of 2 pi 4 tThat’s a simple sine wave with amplitude 5 and frequency 4 cycles per second — or 4 hertz.
And this signal is completely continuous in both time and amplitude.
That means it's defined for every instant in time, not just selected points, and the values can take on any number, not just a limited set.
This is the kind of signal you might get from an ideal microphone or sensor measuring vibration, sound, or light — in the real world, before any digital conversion takes place.

But here’s the key point:
The computer can’t store this curve as it is.So we need to figure out: How often do we need to sample this signal to capture all the important information?
How dense should our sampling be, so that we don’t lose critical features?
And that question brings us right to the Sampling Theorem — the mathematical foundation for how we digitize continuous signals without losing information.
That’s exactly what we’ll examine next.
