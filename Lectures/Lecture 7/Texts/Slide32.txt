Let’s go back to the real form of the Fourier series.

Here’s the idea: if you have a periodic function — let’s call it f of t — you can express it as a weighted sum of sines and cosines.

The formula goes like this:
f of t equalsa naught divided by 2,plus the sum, from n equals 1 to N,of a n times cosine of 2 pi n t,plus b n times sine of 2 pi n t.

In this expression, a naught is the average value of the function over one full period. That’s also called the DC component.
The rest of the terms — the cosine and sine parts — describe how the function varies over time. Each n corresponds to a different frequency: the higher the value of n, the higher the frequency.

Now, how do we compute those coefficients — a naught, a n, and b n?
Let’s start with a naught divided by 2.
That’s equal to the integral of f of t from 0 to 1.In other words, you’re just averaging the function over one period.
Next, to compute a n,you take 2 times the integral from 0 to 1of f of t times cosine of 2 pi n t.
And to compute b n,You take 2 times the integral from 0 to 1of f of t times sine of 2 pi n t.
Each coefficient tells you how much of that sine or cosine wave is present in the original function.

Now here's something important:The lowest frequency in this series appears when n equals 1. That corresponds to a frequency of 2 pi.The highest frequency depends on N, which is the upper limit of the sum — and that gives us a maximum frequency of 2 pi times N.
So by adjusting N, we can control how detailed our approximation is.
This is the real-valued Fourier series — a sum of sine and cosine waves, each scaled by how much of that frequency exists in your signal.
