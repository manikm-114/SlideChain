So here we have another view of that same example.
This wave has a frequency of 4 hertz — meaning it completes 4 full cycles per second.

Now we’re sampling it with a very small interval, or in other words, at a very high rate: 256 samples per second. That’s far more frequent than the wave itself changes.
And the result is what we call well-sampled data.

As you can see, the discrete dots — the sampling points — follow the shape of the original wave very closely.There’s no confusion. No ambiguity. No major information is lost.
This is exactly what we want when digitizing a signal — the samples capture the behavior of the original continuous signal with high accuracy.

Heuristically, you can just look at the plot and say: yes, these samples preserve the essence of the original wave.
So, in this case, we can confidently say: the sampling was successful.
But what if we sample too slowly?
Let’s take a look at that next.
