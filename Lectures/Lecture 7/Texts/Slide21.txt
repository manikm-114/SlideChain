Let’s now look at what’s happening in the spatial domain when we sample a signal.

Imagine you have a continuous signal — shown on the left. To sample this signal, what we’re really doing is multiplying it by a train of impulses. That’s the middle figure.
These impulses are spaced evenly along the axis, representing fixed sampling intervals. And when you multiply the continuous signal by this impulse train, the result is a set of discrete values. That’s what you see on the right: only the values of the signal at those impulse positions are preserved — the rest are discarded.

In the spatial domain, sampling is essentially a point-wise multiplication of the signal with an impulse train.
And here’s the key idea: this operation in the spatial domain has a direct consequence in the frequency domain. Multiplying by an impulse train in space corresponds to replicating the spectrum of the signal — creating a periodic train of delta functions in the frequency domain.
Just as we observe periodicity in time or space due to regular sampling, we also obtain periodicity in frequency. This connection — between operations in the spatial domain and their effects in the frequency domain — is fundamental in signal processing.
