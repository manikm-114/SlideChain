Now, let’s connect Fourier series with sampling.

Suppose you have a function, like the one shown here, and you want to represent it over time using a Fourier series. The key idea is this:
If your function is defined over a unit interval — let’s say from zero to one — then the standard real-form Fourier series can represent it as a sum of cosine and sine terms, just like we saw earlier.
That’s perfectly fine when your function repeats every one second. But in general, a real-world signal may repeat over a different period — maybe two seconds, or ten seconds, or any value we call capital P.

So, how do we handle that?
The answer is: you simply normalize your time axis. You scale the time so that the function fits into a unit interval. Then you apply the standard Fourier series there.
Once you’ve built the series, you can scale it back to its original time frame — from zero to capital P — and you get a Fourier expansion that models the function over its true period.

So to summarize: the Fourier series has the flexibility to represent any periodic function, no matter what its period is. You just need to adjust for that period in the formulation — and the structure stays exactly the same.
This makes Fourier analysis an incredibly powerful tool when dealing with signals of any repeating pattern.
