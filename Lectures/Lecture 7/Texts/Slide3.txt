Let me show you a logo I designed to help you understand the foundation of signal processing in a visual way.
Inside the circle, you’ll see the expression: delta multiplied by e to the power i theta.That’s delta times e to the i theta.
This might remind you of Euler’s formula, where e to the power i theta equals cosine theta plus i times sine theta.
So this single term includes both a real part — the cosine — and an imaginary part — the sine.
Now, the delta function here stands for an impulse — something that happens instantly, at a single point in time.
Together, the delta and the exponential show us two building blocks we’ll come back to again and again: sharp spikes and smooth waves.
But that’s not enough to build real-world signals.

To represent a general signal, we also need to be able to shift and scale these building blocks.
Shifting means moving a function left or right in time.Scaling means stretching or compressing it, or changing its amplitude.
For example, with sine waves, we can change the frequency — making them faster or slower.We can also shift them in time — or scale the height — to make them louder or softer.

So when we say “operators need to shift and scale,” we mean we need to move and adjust these basic functions — the delta and the sine wave — to create more complex signals.
And with that power, we can build up any continuous or piecewise continuous function.
That’s the big idea behind this logo — a visual summary of how signal processing works at its core.
