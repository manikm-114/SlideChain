Now here’s what happens when the sampling is too slow.
This plot shows a rapidly oscillating signal — it's a sine wave with a high frequency. But look at those red dots. Those are the actual points we sampled, and as you can see, there are only a few of them.
This is a classic case of under-sampling.

In this case, the original signal — that fine blue waveform — is oscillating at a frequency of 8 hertz. But the sampling rate is just 8.5 samples per second, which is not high enough to capture the details of the wave.

So what’s the problem?
Well, based on just the red dots, it might look like the wave is slowly rising and falling — as if it’s a low-frequency signal. But that’s not true at all.
This is known as aliasing — when a high-frequency signal gets misinterpreted as something much lower in frequency, simply because it was sampled too slowly.
So even though you're doing regular sampling — evenly spaced in time — the result can be very misleading if your sampling rate is too low.

This example shows why choosing the right sampling rate is critical.Too slow, and you could end up completely misrepresenting your signal.
Next, let’s talk about the theoretical limit — the Nyquist rate — and how it protects us from this problem.
