Let’s go through a helpful example using a two-dimensional rectangular function. This is a classic case to build intuition around how the Fourier transform behaves in two dimensions.

Imagine a rectangle that’s centered at the origin. It has a total width of capital X along the x-axis, and a total height of capital Y along the y-axis. The function value is constant — say, equal to 1 — inside this rectangle, and zero outside.

We now take the 2D Fourier transform of this rectangle. The formula looks a bit dense, but the steps are straightforward.

We start with the double integral of the original function times the complex exponential — e to the power minus j 2 pi times the quantity u x plus v y. That’s the standard definition of the 2D Fourier transform.
Since the function is separable — meaning it depends independently on x and y — we can break the double integral into two parts:
one over x, and one over y.
Evaluating each of these integrals separately gives us a product of two expressions.
Each part turns into a sinc function. In the x-direction, we get sin of pi times X u over pi X u — that’s sinc of pi X u. And in the y-direction, it’s sinc of pi Y v.

So the full 2D Fourier transform ends up as the product of these two sinc functions — one in the u-direction, and one in the v-direction — scaled by the area of the original rectangle, which is X times Y.
Now if you look at the plot here, you’ll see a 3D surface that shows the magnitude of the Fourier transform — the peak is at the center, and the ripples decay outward. That shape comes directly from the sinc functions.

Why are we showing this?
Because it mirrors the result we saw earlier: when a rectangular function is defined in one domain — here it’s the spatial domain — its transform becomes a sinc function in the other domain — in this case, the frequency domain.
This is closely related to the idea we discussed on the previous slide, where the rectangle — or gate — was in the frequency domain, and its transform was a sinc function in time. Whether you go forward or inverse, the core relationship stays similar.
So while this example is technically a bit different — it’s 2D, and it’s a forward transform — the intuition still applies. Rectangles and sinc functions are transform pairs. And we use that fact again and again in signal processing and imaging.
