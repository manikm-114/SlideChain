Let’s now take a closer look at the Fourier transform of this impulse train — and I’ll explain it in a way that’s easier to follow, even if not perfectly rigorous.

Suppose we have a signal made of delta functions spaced by a fixed interval, capital T. This is a periodic function, right? It repeats every T. So we can use a Fourier series to represent it.

We write this function, s T of t, as a sum of delta functions at every multiple of T:s T of t equals the sum over n of delta of t minus n T.
Now, since it's periodic, we can also express it as a sum of complex exponentials — that’s what a Fourier series does. So we write:s T of t equals the sum over n of c n times e to the power j 2 pi n t over T,where c n is the Fourier coefficient.
To compute c n, we take the standard approach:c n equals 1 over T times the integral over one period of s T of t multiplied by e to the power negative j 2 pi n t over T.
But here’s the trick — remember that s T of t is a train of delta functions. That means when you integrate, only the delta at t = 0 survives. 

The result is simply:c n equals 1 over T.
So when you plug this back in, your entire Fourier series becomes a sum of complex exponentials, each with coefficient 1 over T.
Now, there’s a well-known identity:A sum of complex exponentials with equal spacing and equal weights becomes a train of delta functions in the frequency domain.

So finally, we can write:s T of t transforms to (1 over T) times s 1 over T of u.That is, the train of impulses in time maps to another train of impulses in frequency, with flipped spacing and scaled amplitude.
This is what we call a Fourier pair. A comb in one domain becomes another comb in the other domain — with the spacing inverted and amplitude scaled.
This idea is fundamental in signal processing. You’ll see it over and over — whether you’re analyzing sampling, modulation, or reconstruction.

Now, I’ll admit — this version of the derivation is not entirely rigorous. It's a bit hand-wavy. A more precise proof would involve deeper mathematical tools, especially when it comes to convergence. But for our purposes, this intuitive explanation gives you the right picture.

So just keep this in mind:A periodic sequence of impulses in time transforms into another periodic sequence in frequency, and the spacing and amplitude follow a simple reciprocal relationship.
