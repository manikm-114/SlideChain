Let’s now apply Parseval’s theorem to a practical example — the average power of a periodic signal.

Here we’re working with a power signal, which is a signal that keeps oscillating over time, like a sine wave.
The average power P of such a signal over one period — from minus capital T over 2 to plus capital T over 2 — is given by:
P equals 1 over T, times the integral of the absolute value of x of t squared, d t.
According to Parseval’s theorem for power signals, we can also express this using the Fourier series coefficients.So, power equals the sum of the absolute value squared of all c  n — the Fourier coefficients — from n equals minus infinity to infinity.

Let’s go through the example.
Suppose we have this signal:
x of t equals 2 times sine of 100 t.
That’s just a sinusoidal wave with amplitude 2 and frequency 100.
Now, suppose this signal is the voltage across a unit resistor — that is, a resistor with resistance equal to 1 ohm.
Then the instantaneous power is just the voltage squared, and the average power is the integral of the squared signal over one period, divided by T.

Let’s calculate it first in the time domain:
We square the signal:2 times sine of 100 t becomes 4 times sine squared of 100 t.
When we compute the average of that over one period, we get:
P equals 2.

Now let’s do it in the frequency domain, using the Fourier series.
We rewrite the sine wave using Euler’s formula:
sine of 100 t equals e to the j 100 t minus e to the minus j 100 t, over 2 j.
So our signal becomes:
x of t equals 2 times that expression, which simplifies to:
minus j e to the j 100 t, plus j e to the minus j 100 t.
Comparing this to the general form of a Fourier series:
x of t equals the sum of c  n times e to the j n omega naught t,we can identify the coefficients:
c  1 equals minus j, andc  minus 1 equals plus j.

Now we apply Parseval’s theorem:
The total power is the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of these coefficients.
So we compute:
absolute value of c one squared, which is 1,plus absolute value of c minus one squared, also 1.
Adding them gives us 2 — the same result we got in the time domain.

This example shows how Parseval’s theorem works in practice.
You can either:
Square the signal and average it over time,or Decompose the signal into its sinusoidal components, square their coefficients, and sum them up.

Either way, you’ll get the same result. That’s the beauty of Fourier analysis — it gives you two consistent views of the same signal.
And this works not just for simple sine waves — it holds even when a signal is made up of many frequencies, including very high ones.Just square each coefficient, add them up, and you’ll know the total power of the signal.
