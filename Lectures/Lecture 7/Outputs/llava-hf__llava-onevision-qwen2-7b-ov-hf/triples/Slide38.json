Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s go through a helpful example using a two-dimensional rectangular function. This is a classic case to build intuition around how the Fourier transform behaves in two dimensions.\n\nImagine a rectangle that’s centered at the origin. It has a total width of capital X along the x-axis, and a total height of capital Y along the y-axis. The function value is constant — say, equal to 1 — inside this rectangle, and zero outside.\n\nWe now take the 2D Fourier transform of this rectangle. The formula looks a bit dense, but the steps are straightforward.\n\nWe start with the double integral of the original function times the complex exponential — e to the power minus j 2 pi times the quantity u x plus v y. That’s the standard definition of the 2D Fourier transform.\nSince the function is separable — meaning it depends independently on x and y — we can break the double integral into two parts:\none over x, and one over y.\nEvaluating each of these integrals separately gives us a product of two expressions.\nEach part turns into a sinc function. In the x-direction, we get sin of pi times X u over pi X u — that’s sinc of pi X u. And in the y-direction, it’s sinc of pi Y v.\n\nSo the full 2D Fourier transform ends up as the product of these two sinc functions — one in the u-direction, and one in the v-direction — scaled by the area of the original rectangle, which is X times Y.\nNow if you look at the plot here, you’ll see a 3D surface that shows the magnitude of the Fourier transform — the peak is at the center, and the ripples decay outward. That shape comes directly from the sinc functions.\n\nWhy are we showing this?\nBecause it mirrors the result we saw earlier: when a rectangular function is defined in one domain — here it’s the spatial domain — its transform becomes a sinc function in the other domain — in this case, the frequency domain.\nThis is closely related to the idea we discussed on the previous slide, where the rectangle — or gate — was in the frequency domain, and its transform was a sinc function in time. Whether you go forward or inverse, the core relationship stays similar.\nSo while this example is technically a bit different — it’s 2D, and it’s a forward transform — the intuition still applies. Rectangles and sinc functions are transform pairs. And we use that fact again and again in signal processing and imaging.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
