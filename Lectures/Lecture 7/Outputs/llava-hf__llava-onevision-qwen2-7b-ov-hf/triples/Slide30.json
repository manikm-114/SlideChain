Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s take a moment to revisit this important concept — the impulse train, or what we often call a \"comb\", and its mirror relationship in the Fourier domain.\n\nOn the left side, we see a train of delta functions spaced by a constant interval, capital T. This lives in the time domain. And on the right, we see another train of delta functions — this time in the frequency domain — spaced by one over T.\n\nThis is a classic Fourier pair. When you take the Fourier transform of a periodic train of impulses in time, you get another train of impulses in frequency. And the spacing in the frequency domain is the reciprocal of the spacing in the time domain.\n\nNow, let’s look at the lower pair of plots.\nHere, the red comb has impulses spaced by a small interval, delta t. In that case, the spacing in the frequency domain becomes capital P, which equals one over delta t.\nAgain, we see the same idea — spacing in one domain leads to reciprocal spacing in the other. This reciprocal relationship is a fundamental feature of the Fourier transform.\nThe height or amplitude also changes accordingly. Specifically, when the spacing decreases — say, from T to delta t — the impulses become more densely packed, and the total energy gets spread out more in frequency space. So the amplitudes must be adjusted accordingly to conserve energy.\n\nSo in summary:\u000bA periodic impulse train in time becomes a periodic impulse train in frequency.\u000bThe spacing flips — T becomes 1 over T.\u000bThe amplitudes are scaled appropriately.\nThis relationship is so central to sampling, reconstruction, and many other applications in signal processing. You’ll see it again and again — both in theory and in practice.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
