Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nWhen we want a practical alternative to the ideal or cheap sampling filters, a Gaussian filter offers a great compromise.\n\nNow, what makes the Gaussian special is this: its Fourier transform is also a Gaussian. That’s quite rare — most functions change significantly when transformed between the spatial and frequency domains. But the Gaussian stays in the same form, just scaled differently.\nSo, if you multiply by a Gaussian in the frequency domain, that corresponds to convolving with a Gaussian in the spatial or time domain — and vice versa.\n\nWhy is this helpful? Because the Gaussian function decays very quickly. That means we avoid the problem of infinite ringing, like we saw with the sinc function. Instead of having a sharp cutoff, which can cause artifacts, the Gaussian gives a smooth transition and localized effect — both in frequency and in space.\n\nIt's not mathematically perfect, but it’s practical. And in many real-world applications — especially in imaging and signal processing — that’s the trade-off we need.\nSo overall, the Gaussian sampling filter is a good, balanced choice that works well in both domains.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"Gaussian filter\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"Sampling filter\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"When we want a practical alternative to the ideal or cheap sampling filters, a Gaussian filter offers a great compromise.\"}\n  ]\n}",
