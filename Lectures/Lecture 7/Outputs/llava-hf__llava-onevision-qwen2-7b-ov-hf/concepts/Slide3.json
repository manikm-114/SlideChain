From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet me show you a logo I designed to help you understand the foundation of signal processing in a visual way.\nInside the circle, you’ll see the expression: delta multiplied by e to the power i theta.\u000bThat’s delta times e to the i theta.\nThis might remind you of Euler’s formula, where e to the power i theta equals cosine theta plus i times sine theta.\n\u000bSo this single term includes both a real part — the cosine — and an imaginary part — the sine.\nNow, the delta function here stands for an impulse — something that happens instantly, at a single point in time.\nTogether, the delta and the exponential show us two building blocks we’ll come back to again and again: sharp spikes and smooth waves.\nBut that’s not enough to build real-world signals.\n\nTo represent a general signal, we also need to be able to shift and scale these building blocks.\nShifting means moving a function left or right in time.\u000bScaling means stretching or compressing it, or changing its amplitude.\nFor example, with sine waves, we can change the frequency — making them faster or slower.\u000bWe can also shift them in time — or scale the height — to make them louder or softer.\n\nSo when we say “operators need to shift and scale,” we mean we need to move and adjust these basic functions — the delta and the sine wave — to create more complex signals.\nAnd with that power, we can build up any continuous or piecewise continuous function.\nThat’s the big idea behind this logo — a visual summary of how signal processing works at its core.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"delta function\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"exponential function\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"impulse\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"shifting\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"scaling\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"sine wave\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"complex signals\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"operators\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"shift and scale\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"continuous or piecewise continuous function\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"That’s delta times e to the i theta.\", \"Together, the delta and the exponential show us two building blocks we’ll come back to again and again: sharp spikes and smooth waves.\", \"But that’s not enough to build real-world signals.\", \"To represent a general signal, we also need to be able to shift and scale these building blocks.\", \"Shifting means moving a function left or right in time",
