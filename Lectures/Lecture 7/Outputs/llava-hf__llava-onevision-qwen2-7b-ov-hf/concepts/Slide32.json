From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s go back to the real form of the Fourier series.\n\nHere’s the idea: if you have a periodic function — let’s call it f of t — you can express it as a weighted sum of sines and cosines.\n\nThe formula goes like this:\nf of t equals\u000ba naught divided by 2,\u000bplus the sum, from n equals 1 to N,\u000bof a n times cosine of 2 pi n t,\u000bplus b n times sine of 2 pi n t.\n\nIn this expression, a naught is the average value of the function over one full period. That’s also called the DC component.\nThe rest of the terms — the cosine and sine parts — describe how the function varies over time. Each n corresponds to a different frequency: the higher the value of n, the higher the frequency.\n\nNow, how do we compute those coefficients — a naught, a n, and b n?\nLet’s start with a naught divided by 2.\nThat’s equal to the integral of f of t from 0 to 1.\u000bIn other words, you’re just averaging the function over one period.\nNext, to compute a n,\u000byou take 2 times the integral from 0 to 1\u000bof f of t times cosine of 2 pi n t.\nAnd to compute b n,\u000bYou take 2 times the integral from 0 to 1\u000bof f of t times sine of 2 pi n t.\nEach coefficient tells you how much of that sine or cosine wave is present in the original function.\n\nNow here's something important:\u000bThe lowest frequency in this series appears when n equals 1. That corresponds to a frequency of 2 pi.\u000bThe highest frequency depends on N, which is the upper limit of the sum — and that gives us a maximum frequency of 2 pi times N.\nSo by adjusting N, we can control how detailed our approximation is.\nThis is the real-valued Fourier series — a sum of sine and cosine waves, each scaled by how much of that frequency exists in your signal.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
