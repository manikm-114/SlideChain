From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere we’re looking at the difference between a continuous signal and its discrete version.\n\nOn the left, we have a smooth, continuous function — like something you might see in the physical world, such as a sound wave or a voltage signal. It's defined at every instant in time.\n\nBut to work with this signal on a computer, we can't use all those infinite points. Instead, we select only a finite number of values, spaced out at regular intervals. That's what's shown on the right.\nThis process is called sampling.\n\nIf we sample densely enough — meaning, if the points are close together — then the discrete version can represent the continuous signal fairly accurately. The more samples we take, the more detail we preserve from the original waveform.\n\nSo the idea is: start with a smooth, continuous signal and convert it into a sequence of numbers that still captures the shape and behavior of the original. That's what makes signal processing on computers possible.\nUp next, we’ll explore how often we need to sample to preserve that accuracy — and what happens if we don't.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
