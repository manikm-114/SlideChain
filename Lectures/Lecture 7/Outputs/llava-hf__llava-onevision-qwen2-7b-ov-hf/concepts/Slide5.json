From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow that we’ve covered the basics of the Fourier series and transform, let’s talk about a very important result: the Convolution Theorem.\nThis theorem creates a beautiful bridge between two worlds — the time domain and the frequency domain.\n\nHere’s what it says:\u000bConvolution in the time domain becomes multiplication in the frequency domain.\nIn simple terms, if you have a linear, time-invariant system, the output is the convolution of the input signal with the system’s impulse response.\u000bBut instead of computing that convolution directly — which can be messy — you can switch to the frequency domain, where it becomes much easier.\n\nSo, let’s say:\nf of t is your input signal,\ng of t is the system’s impulse response,\nand f star g means the convolution of f and g.\nThen, in the frequency domain, their Fourier transforms — call them F of s and G of s — satisfy this simple rule:\nThe Fourier transform of the convolution equals the product of the individual Fourier transforms.\n\nOr in math:\u000bFourier of f star g equals F of s times G of s.\nThat means you now have two ways to compute the system’s output:\nYou can do convolution in the time domain.\nOr — you can transform both the input and the impulse response into the frequency domain, multiply them there, and then take the inverse Fourier transform to go back to the time domain.\nNow, let’s look at a simple example.\n\nSuppose you convolve two rectangular functions, also called gate functions. Each one looks like a block or a box.\nTo compute the convolution, you flip one function, shift it, multiply the overlapping parts, and add the result.\nWhen the two rectangles perfectly overlap, the area under the curve reaches its maximum. As they move apart, the overlapping area decreases linearly — and what you get is a triangle-shaped function.\nSo, two rectangles convolved give you a triangle.\n\nNow let’s look at this in the frequency domain.\nWe know the Fourier transform of a rectangular function is a sinc function — that’s sinc of s, which comes from sine of pi s over pi s.\nSo when we convolve two rectangles in the time domain, we get a triangle. That means, in the frequency domain, we multiply two sinc functions — and we get sinc squared.\nSo: Triangle in time domain means sinc squared in frequency domain.\n\nThis is a powerful example that helps you visualize the convolution theorem in action. It shows how the shapes in time relate to the shapes in frequency — and why this theorem is such a key tool for signal processing and systems analysis.\nKeep this visual and mathematical link in mind — it will come up again and again.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
