From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo here we have another view of that same example.\nThis wave has a frequency of 4 hertz — meaning it completes 4 full cycles per second.\n\nNow we’re sampling it with a very small interval, or in other words, at a very high rate: 256 samples per second. That’s far more frequent than the wave itself changes.\nAnd the result is what we call well-sampled data.\n\nAs you can see, the discrete dots — the sampling points — follow the shape of the original wave very closely.\u000bThere’s no confusion. No ambiguity. No major information is lost.\nThis is exactly what we want when digitizing a signal — the samples capture the behavior of the original continuous signal with high accuracy.\n\nHeuristically, you can just look at the plot and say: yes, these samples preserve the essence of the original wave.\nSo, in this case, we can confidently say: the sampling was successful.\nBut what if we sample too slowly?\nLet’s take a look at that next.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
