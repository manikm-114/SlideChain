From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nWe’ve now come to a natural turning point in our discussion.\nSo far, everything we’ve studied — from Fourier series and Fourier transforms, to convolution and delta functions — has been in the continuous domain.\n\nBut now we need to ask a very important question:\u000bWhy do we work with digital signals? Why go digital?\n\nWell, here are some good reasons.\nFirst — digital signals are exact.\u000bThey’re stored as numbers, so they don’t degrade over time the way analog signals do.\n\nSecond — errors can be detected and corrected.\u000bDigital systems can automatically check for mistakes during transmission or storage — and even fix them.\n\nThird — noise and interference can be filtered out more easily.\u000bIn a digital system, it's much simpler to distinguish real data from unwanted signals.\n\nFourth — with digital transmission, we can send multiple types of information over the same line — audio, video, text — all bundled together efficiently.\n\nAnd finally — digital systems support data compression, which lets us send more information using less bandwidth.\n\nAll of this is why most modern communication, computation, and imaging systems have moved to the digital domain.\nAnd that brings us to the next part of our journey.\nLet’s study how to process digital signals next.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"digital signals\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"exact\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"errors\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"noise\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"compression\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"digital\", \"category\": \"communication\"},\n    {\"term\": \"digital systems\", \"category\": \"communication\"},\n    {\"term\": \"data\", \"category\": \"data_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"bandwidth\", \"category\": \"communication\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"'But now we need to ask a very important question: Why do we work with digital signals?
