From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s now apply Parseval’s theorem to a practical example — the average power of a periodic signal.\n\nHere we’re working with a power signal, which is a signal that keeps oscillating over time, like a sine wave.\nThe average power P of such a signal over one period — from minus capital T over 2 to plus capital T over 2 — is given by:\nP equals 1 over T, times the integral of the absolute value of x of t squared, d t.\nAccording to Parseval’s theorem for power signals, we can also express this using the Fourier series coefficients.\u000bSo, power equals the sum of the absolute value squared of all c  n — the Fourier coefficients — from n equals minus infinity to infinity.\n\nLet’s go through the example.\nSuppose we have this signal:\nx of t equals 2 times sine of 100 t.\nThat’s just a sinusoidal wave with amplitude 2 and frequency 100.\nNow, suppose this signal is the voltage across a unit resistor — that is, a resistor with resistance equal to 1 ohm.\nThen the instantaneous power is just the voltage squared, and the average power is the integral of the squared signal over one period, divided by T.\n\nLet’s calculate it first in the time domain:\nWe square the signal:\u000b2 times sine of 100 t becomes 4 times sine squared of 100 t.\nWhen we compute the average of that over one period, we get:\nP equals 2.\n\nNow let’s do it in the frequency domain, using the Fourier series.\nWe rewrite the sine wave using Euler’s formula:\nsine of 100 t equals e to the j 100 t minus e to the minus j 100 t, over 2 j.\nSo our signal becomes:\nx of t equals 2 times that expression, which simplifies to:\nminus j e to the j 100 t, plus j e to the minus j 100 t.\nComparing this to the general form of a Fourier series:\nx of t equals the sum of c  n times e to the j n omega naught t,\u000bwe can identify the coefficients:\nc  1 equals minus j, and\u000bc  minus 1 equals plus j.\n\nNow we apply Parseval’s theorem:\nThe total power is the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of these coefficients.\nSo we compute:\nabsolute value of c one squared, which is 1,\u000bplus absolute value of c minus one squared, also 1.\nAdding them gives us 2 — the same result we got in the time domain.\n\nThis example shows how Parseval’s theorem works in practice.\nYou can either:\nSquare the signal and average it over time,\u000bor Decompose the signal into its sinusoidal components, square their coefficients, and sum them up.\n\nEither way, you’ll get the same result. That’s the beauty of Fourier analysis — it gives you two consistent views of the same signal.\nAnd this works not just for simple sine waves — it holds even when a signal is made up of many frequencies, including very high ones.\u000bJust square each coefficient, add them up, and you’ll know the total power of the signal.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
