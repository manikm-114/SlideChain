From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s now turn to a beautiful result in Fourier analysis called Parseval’s Identity.\nThis identity tells us that the total energy of a signal — measured in the time domain — is exactly equal to the total energy in the frequency domain.\n\nMathematically, it says:\nThe integral of the absolute value squared of f of t, over all time, equals the integral of the absolute value squared of f hat of s, over all frequencies.\n\nIn simpler words:\u000bIf you take a signal and square its amplitude at each point in time, then add up all those values — you get the total energy of the signal in the time domain.\nNow do the same thing in the frequency domain:\u000bTake the Fourier transform of the signal, square the magnitude of each frequency component, and integrate — and you get the same total.\n\nThis is not just a coincidence. It’s a direct consequence of the fact that the Fourier transform is a unitary operator — it preserves the “length” of the function, just like a rotation in vector space.\nThink of f of t and f hat of s as infinite-dimensional vectors.\u000bThen, this identity is telling you that their norms — or their lengths — are the same.\u000bSo, the energy stays the same when you move from one domain to the other.\nThis is why we sometimes say that the Fourier transform conserves energy.\n\nThe bottom part of the slide walks through the proof. Let me summarize the key steps:\nWe start with the inner product:\nIntegral of f of t times the complex conjugate of g of t.\nThen, we apply the inverse Fourier transform to g of t.\u000bThis gives us an expression involving f of t and the Fourier transform of g, which we call F g of s.\nThen we do some algebra — using properties of complex conjugation, and switching the order of integration — until we end up with:\nThe integral of f of s times the complex conjugate of g of s.\nSo in the end, the inner product in the time domain equals the inner product in the frequency domain.\n\nThat’s Parseval’s Identity in action — and it works for all functions in an inner product space, not just in signal processing.\nIt’s one more reason why the Fourier transform is not just a clever trick — it’s a deep and powerful tool grounded in geometry and physics.\nIf you’re interested, you can think of it this way:\u000bEvery time you transform a signal into the frequency domain, you’re rotating it into a new basis — and the energy stays exactly the same.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
