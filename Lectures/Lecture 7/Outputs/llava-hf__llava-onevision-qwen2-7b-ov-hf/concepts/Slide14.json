From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow that we’ve seen why digital signals are so useful, let’s take a look at how real-world signals actually make their way into a computer.\nThis diagram shows the full journey — from a physical system to digital data inside your laptop.\n\nLet’s walk through it step by step.\nIt all starts with the physical world — maybe we’re measuring temperature, pressure, light intensity, motion, or some other physical quantity.\n\nTo capture this, we need a sensor — or more specifically, a transducer.\u000bA transducer converts the physical phenomenon into an electrical signal — usually an analog one.\u000bThis analog signal may be noisy, or it may contain extra fluctuations we don’t want.\n\nSo the next step is called signal conditioning.\u000bHere we might filter the signal, smooth it, amplify it, or perform other adjustments to get it into a clean, usable form.\u000bThis step helps us reduce noise and make sure the signal is suitable for the next stage.\n\nNow comes the critical component — the Analog-to-Digital Converter, or A-D converter for short.\nThis is where the continuous analog signal gets sampled and turned into a digital signal — a sequence of numbers the computer can store and process.\n\nMore specifically, to get a analog signal into the computer, let’s break down what happens during digitization with an A/D converter — using this visual example.\n\nHere you see an analog signal, represented here as a smooth, continuous wave — like a sound wave moving across time.\u000bActually, a digital computer can’t store this continuous curve directly.\u000bInstead, it must sample the signal at specific time points.\n\nAt each of these time points, we ask:\u000bWhat is the value of the signal right here?\u000bAnd that gives us a sequence of numbers.\nIn the rightmost illustration, you can see vertical bars that “catch” the wave at regular intervals.\u000bThese bars represent sampling operations — and the height of each bar shows the value of the signal at that point in time.\n\nNow, here's something important:\u000bThe computer can’t store every possible value — like pi=3.14159 etc. or e=2.71828 etc. with infinite precision.\u000bInstead, it must round the values to the nearest available level.\nThis process is called quantization.\u000bIt means converting a smooth, continuous range of amplitudes into a set of fixed, discrete values — often represented by whole numbers.\n\nSo here, we get a string of numbers like:\u000b3, 5, 6, 6, 4, 2, 1, 2.\nAnd these numbers are what the computer stores.\nBut even these whole numbers aren’t stored in decimal form.\u000bComputers use binary — just zeros and ones to represent either an integral or a decimal number.\n\nSo each number gets translated into binary. For example:\n1 becomes zero one,\n2 becomes one zero,\n3 becomes one one,\nand so on.\nThis is how a continuous analog signal — like sound or temperature — becomes a digital signal inside a computer:\u000bFirst through sampling across time, then through quantization of amplitude, and finally through binary encoding.\n\nEach step introduces a tradeoff:\nMore sampling points give better resolution in time.\nMore quantization levels give better precision in amplitude.\nBut more of both means more data to store and process.\nThis is the foundation of digital signal processing — and now you’ve seen how it all begins.\n\nAnd finally, that digital data — made up of zeros and ones — enters the computer, where it can be displayed, analyzed, stored, or transmitted.\n\nSo again, the pipeline goes like this:\nPhysical system → transducer → signal conditioning → analog-to-digital conversion → computer.\nThis entire process happens in almost every modern system — from medical devices to smart homes to autonomous vehicles.\nAnd the better we understand this chain, the better we can design systems that are accurate, efficient, and reliable.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
