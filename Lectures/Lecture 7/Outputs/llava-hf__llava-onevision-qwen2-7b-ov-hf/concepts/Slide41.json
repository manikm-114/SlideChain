From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s focus on the last few steps of the derivation and clarify what’s happening here, line by line.\nPreviously, we had the convolution of two time-domain signals: one was a sinc function, the other was a sum of scaled impulses. That brought us to this expression:\nf of t equals sinc of pi P t, divided by pi P t, convolved with the sum from k equals minus infinity to infinity of f of t times delta of t minus k over P.\nLet’s unpack that.\nFirst, remember that this sum is what we call a delta train — an infinite series of delta functions spaced at intervals of 1 over P.\n\nNow you might ask — wait a minute, where did the 1 over P factor go?\nGood observation.\nOriginally, the delta train had a scaling factor of 1 over P. But earlier in the derivation, we also had a P multiplying the sinc function. So those two terms — P and 1 over P — cancel out. That’s why we don’t see the 1 over P anymore in the final expression.\n\nSo what do we have now?\nWe have a continuous function — that’s the sinc — multiplying a series of impulses that are sampling the original function at regular intervals.\nThis is the essence of the sampling process.\nThe function f of t is being sampled at every t equals k over P, and the result is a series of weighted sinc functions. Each one is centered at t equals k over P and scaled by the corresponding sample value, f of k over P.\nAnd that brings us to the final expression:\nf of t equals the sum from k equals minus infinity to infinity of f of k over P, multiplied by sinc of pi P times t minus k over P, divided by pi P times t minus k over P.\nThat’s the sampling theorem.\n\nIt tells us that if a signal is band-limited — that is, its frequency content is restricted — then we can reconstruct the entire continuous-time signal exactly from its samples, as long as the sampling rate is high enough.\nEach sample contributes a scaled sinc function, and the sum of all those sinc functions reconstructs the original signal.\nThis formula is both elegant and powerful — and it lies at the foundation of all modern digital signal processing.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
