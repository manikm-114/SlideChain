Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s take a moment to review this important concept — how a continuous function can be represented using delta functions.\nYou may remember that the delta function plays a central role in signal processing.\u000b\nAnd here's the key idea:\u000bWhen you multiply a delta function with a continuous function f of t, and integrate over all time, the result is just the value of f at the point where the delta is centered.\n\nMathematically, we write:\nThe integral from minus infinity to infinity of delta of t minus t naught, times f of t, d t — equals f of t naught.\nThis tells us that the delta function samples the value of f at t naught.\u000bIt picks out that one value and ignores everything else.\n\nNow, you might wonder how this works — so here’s an intuitive explanation.\nThink of the delta function as the limit of a very narrow and very tall pulse — getting narrower and taller, but always keeping the same area, which is 1.\n\nSo if we take that narrow pulse, center it at t naught, and multiply it with f of t, we get a tiny slice of the function near t naught.\nWhen we integrate over that narrow region, the result becomes:\nf of t star, where t star is some point very close to t naught.\nAnd in the limit — as the width goes to zero — that becomes exactly:\nf of t naught.\nSo this is how we record a sample.\n\nIt also leads us to a deeper interpretation:\nWe can reconstruct the entire function f of t by summing up all these infinitesimal slices — each one represented by a delta function, placed at the right location, and scaled by the value of the function at that point.\n\nThat’s what this second formula is saying:\nf of t equals the integral from minus infinity to infinity of delta of tau minus t, times f of tau, d tau.\nIt’s a kind of weighted sum of deltas — where the weights are just the values of the function itself.\n\nYou can think of this as a very fine-grained, particle-like view of a continuous function.\u000bEach point — each “particle” — contributes through a delta function, and together, they rebuild the original signal.\nThis is not just a mathematical trick — it connects deeply with how we sample, record, and reconstruct signals in the real world.\nAnd once again, it highlights why the delta function is so important — both in theory and in practice.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
