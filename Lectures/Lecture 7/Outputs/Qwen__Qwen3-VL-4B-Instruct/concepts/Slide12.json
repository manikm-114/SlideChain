From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s revisit the convolution theorem — this time with a concrete visual example to help reinforce the idea.\nThis theorem is incredibly important, and we’ll keep coming back to it.\u000bSo it's essential to get comfortable with how it works — both mathematically and visually.\n\nLet’s look at what we have here.\nIn the top row, we see three time-domain signals:\nOn the left is f of x, a simple rectangular function, also known as a gate function, centered at zero and extending from minus b over 2 to plus b over 2.\nIn the middle is h of x, which consists of two delta functions — located symmetrically around zero at minus a over 2 and plus a over 2.\nOn the right is the result of the convolution of f and h — which we’ll call g of x.\n\nNow remember:\u000bWhen you convolve a function with a delta, the result is simply a shifted version of that function.\nSo here, convolving the gate function f of x with each of the two deltas in h of x gives us two shifted gate functions — one shifted left and one shifted right.\u000b\nWhen we add them together, we get g of x — a pair of rectangular pulses.\nNow let’s look at the bottom row — this is the frequency domain.\nHere’s where the convolution theorem comes in.\n\nAccording to the theorem:\nConvolution in the time domain becomes multiplication in the frequency domain.\nSo we take the Fourier transforms of the three signals:\nf of x becomes capital F of k, which is a sinc-shaped curve — smooth and localized in frequency.\nh of x, which had two deltas in time, becomes a cosine wave in the frequency domain — that’s capital H of k, centered at zero, with oscillations depending on the spacing of the deltas.\n\nNow, to get capital G of k, we multiply the two frequency-domain functions:\nCapital F of k times capital H of k equals capital G of k.\nAnd the result, shown on the right, is a modulated sinc — essentially the original sinc shape, but with oscillations introduced by the cosine multiplier.\n\nSo the key takeaway is this:\nIn time, the convolution added and shifted the pulses.\nIn frequency, the multiplication mixed the smooth sinc shape with oscillations.\nThis is a perfect visual illustration of what the convolution theorem does:\nIt transforms an operation that involves sliding and summing in time into a much simpler pointwise multiplication in the frequency domain.\nUnderstanding this duality will help you immensely when working with signals — whether in analysis, filtering, or system design.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
