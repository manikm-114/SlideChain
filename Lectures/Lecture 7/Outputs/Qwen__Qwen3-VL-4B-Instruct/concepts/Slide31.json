From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s dive into the process of sampling a signal — how we go from the continuous world to the digital one.\n\nLook first at the top-left plot. That’s our original continuous signal, shown over a finite interval, from minus T over 2 to plus T over 2. Our goal is to digitize this — to convert it into a form that we can process on a computer.\nAnd to do that, we take measurements at evenly spaced time intervals. This step is crucial, because without any prior knowledge about the signal, we don't know where we should sample more densely or more sparsely — so we just use uniform sampling.\n\nWe model this sampling process mathematically by multiplying the signal with a train of impulses — those red vertical lines spaced by delta t. This models a measurement being taken at regular intervals — just like a thermometer recording temperature every hour.\n\nWhen we multiply the continuous function by this comb of impulses, we’re essentially pulling out values at those discrete points. The result is a sampled signal, where the values are available only at those locations. That’s what you see in the next plot below — the discrete signal.\n\nNow shift your attention to the right-hand side — to the frequency domain.\nThe original continuous signal, when transformed using the Fourier transform, gives us a spectrum — and here it's shown to be concentrated between minus W and plus W. That’s the bandwidth of the signal — most of its energy lies within that frequency range.\nAnd here’s something interesting: if a signal is limited in time — meaning it's non-zero only within a certain interval — then its Fourier transform will spread out infinitely. But if the time-domain signal is smooth, then the energy in its spectrum decays very fast. So in practice, we can often ignore the tiny tails and just focus on the dominant part within minus W to W.\n\nNow, here comes the key insight.\nWhen we sample the time-domain signal using a comb — a series of impulses spaced by delta t — then in the frequency domain, the Fourier transform becomes a convolution. That convolution replicates the original spectrum at regular intervals — and those intervals are one over delta t, which we denote as capital P.\nSo in the frequency domain, we now have multiple copies of the original spectrum, all spaced by P. These are sometimes called spectral replicas.\n\nAnd here’s the big question: how small should delta t be? Or in other words — how dense should our sampling be — so that these spectral copies don’t overlap?\nBecause if they overlap, we get aliasing, and the original signal can’t be recovered. But if P — that is, one over delta t — is large enough, then these copies stay nicely separated, and we can isolate just one of them to recover the original signal perfectly.\n\nSo in short, if we sample densely enough, we don't lose any information. We can convert a continuous signal to a digital one and then reconstruct it — as if nothing was lost.\nAnd that naturally brings us to the next topic — what is the minimum sampling rate we need to guarantee perfect recovery?\nLet’s take a look.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
