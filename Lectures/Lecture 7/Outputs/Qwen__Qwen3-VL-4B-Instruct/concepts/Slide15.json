From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo now that we’ve brought our signal into the computer, let’s take a closer look at what’s really happening during analog-to-digital conversion.\n\nAs you can see in the top plot, we start with a smooth, continuous signal — x of t — defined for all time and with continuous amplitude.\nBut the computer can’t store that continuous curve — it needs discrete data.\nSo we begin with the first major step: sampling, also called discretization in time.\nThis means we only record the value of the signal at selected time points — evenly spaced along the horizontal axis.\u000bAt each of these points, we “catch” the value of the signal, just like placing a pin at that instant.\n‘\nNow, the second step is quantization — converting the amplitude of each sample into a finite-precision value.\nWe can’t store irrational numbers like pi or e with infinite precision.\u000bInstead, we round them to a reasonable approximation — say, 3.14 for pi.\u000bAnd for our purposes, we assume this rounding is accurate enough to not affect the result significantly.\nSo in our analysis, we mostly ignore the quantization error and focus on sampling — the time discretization.\n\nThe bottom diagram shows how the sampled signal looks:\u000bIt’s now a series of impulses — each one located at a sample time and scaled to the value of the original signal at that moment.\nThis sequence of impulses is what we work with in digital signal processing.\n\nBut here’s something important to remember:\nThe real signal — the one that matters in the physical world — is still continuous.\nWhat we do with computers is a second-best approximation, based on discrete samples.\n\nSo the key question becomes:\nCan we process these sampled values in a way that still lets us understand or recover the original continuous signal?\nThis is the challenge at the heart of signal processing — bridging the gap between discrete computation and continuous reality.\nAnd that’s what we’ll be exploring in the next steps of our journey.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
