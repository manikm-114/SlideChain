From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s now walk through an example to help us better understand why the convolution theorem works — especially when sinusoids are involved.\n\nWe’ll use a one-dimensional, shift-invariant linear system.\u000bIn such a system, the output — which we’ll call o of t — is the convolution of the system’s impulse response h of t with the input signal, i of t.\nSo we write:\no of t equals h of t convolved with i of t.\nAccording to the convolution theorem, when we take the Fourier transform of both sides, this convolution becomes multiplication.\nSo we have:\ncapital O of u equals capital H of u times capital I of u,\u000bwhere capital O, H, and I are the Fourier transforms of the output, impulse response, and input, respectively, and u is the frequency variable.\n\nNow, let’s suppose we feed the system a complex sinusoidal input.\u000bThat is:\u000bi of t equals e to the power i 2 pi u naught t,\u000bwhere u naught is the frequency of the sinusoid.\nAs we learned earlier, the Fourier transform of a pure sinusoidal signal is a delta function.\u000bSo, in the frequency domain:\ncapital I of u equals delta of u minus u naught.\nThis delta function tells us the signal contains only one frequency — u naught — and no others.\n\nNow, using the convolution theorem:\ncapital O of u equals capital H of u times delta of u minus u naught.\nMultiplying anything by a delta function simply picks out the value at that point.\u000bSo this simplifies to:\ncapital O of u equals H of u naught times delta of u minus u naught.\nThis tells us that the output, in the frequency domain, also consists of a single frequency — the same one as the input — and it’s just scaled by the system’s transfer function at that frequency, which is H of u naught.\nNow we go back to the time domain.\n\nIf the Fourier transform of the output is a scaled delta function in frequency, then the time-domain output must also be a sinusoid — at the same frequency.\nSo, we have:\no of t equals H of u naught times e to the power i 2 pi u naught t.\nThis shows that the output is still a complex sinusoid — same frequency as the input — but scaled by a factor, H of u naught, which may include amplitude and phase changes.\nThe key idea here is:\nThe frequency doesn't change.\nNo new frequencies are generated.\nThe output stays sinusoidal if the input was sinusoidal.\n\nThis confirms that a shift-invariant linear system preserves frequency when the input is a pure sinusoid.\nAnd we were able to demonstrate this clearly and quickly — thanks to the convolution theorem and the properties of the Fourier transform.\nIt’s a great example of how math gives us not just a result, but deep insight into how signals behave in systems.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
