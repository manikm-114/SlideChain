From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s now talk about estimating the DC component in a signal.\n\nSuppose we have a continuous function, and we sample it over the interval from zero to one. The first question we should ask is: how can we estimate the DC term?\n\nRemember, in a Fourier series, the DC component is the constant part of the signal — and mathematically, it’s given by the average value of the function over one full period. So, for a continuous function, that just means integrating from zero to one and dividing by the length of the interval.\n\nNow, in practice, we don't work with continuous signals — we sample them. That means we take a finite number of measurements, evenly spaced across the interval. So how do we estimate the DC component from those samples?\nVery simply: we add up all the sampled values, and then we take the average. That average gives us a good estimate of the DC component — the constant term in the Fourier series. \nSo once we’ve taken care of the DC term, we still need to determine the coefficients for the sine and cosine terms — the oscillating parts of the signal.\n\nLet’s say we want to recover N cosine coefficients and N sine coefficients. That gives us a total of 2 times N unknowns. And to solve for 2N unknowns, we’ll need at least 2N independent equations — meaning 2N sampled values.\nSo the takeaway is this: to fully recover a periodic signal using its Fourier series up to N harmonics, you need at least 2N equally spaced sample points. That gives you just enough information to solve for all the Fourier coefficients.\nAnd again, the DC component is simple — just average your samples.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
