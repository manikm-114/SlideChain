From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s shift gears and talk about conditioning in the spatial domain.\n\nSuppose you start with a signal that has a lot of sharp changes — a noisy or high-frequency function, like the one shown on the left. Before sampling or further processing, we often want to smooth out the extremes. This helps avoid issues like aliasing or instability in reconstruction.\n\nSo what do we do?\nWe multiply the signal by a smooth, bell-shaped function — something like a Gaussian. That’s the curve shown in the middle. This operation acts like a soft window. It suppresses the values at the edges and emphasizes the center part of the signal.\nThe result, shown on the right, is a conditioned signal. It’s still based on the original data, but now it’s more concentrated, more stable, and less prone to causing problems downstream.\n\nThis process is called conditioning — and in the spatial domain, it’s done by pointwise multiplication. We’re not changing the signal globally — just shaping it locally to make it behave better.\nThis idea becomes even more powerful when we look at its effect in the frequency domain — and that’s where we’re headed next.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
