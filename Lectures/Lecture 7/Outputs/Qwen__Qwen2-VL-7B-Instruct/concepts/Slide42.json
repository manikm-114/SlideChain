From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s take a step back now and look at how analog signals are converted to digital.\nAt the top, we have a smooth, continuous signal — this is your analog signal — represented here as f of t, where t is time.\n\nNow, to digitize this signal, we begin with the process of sampling. In the middle plot, you see a train of delta functions — these are evenly spaced impulses in time. Each one of them marks a point where we will sample the analog signal.\n\nNext, what do we do?\nWe multiply the continuous signal by this train of impulses. That’s shown in the bottom figure.\nThis multiplication essentially picks out the values of the original signal at those discrete time points — and sets everything else to zero. In other words, it’s like punching holes in the continuous function, keeping only the values at regular intervals.\nThe result is a series of weighted impulses, where the height of each spike corresponds to the signal’s value at that instant.\nAnd this is the essence of analog-to-digital conversion.\n\nWe’ve turned a smooth, continuous-time signal into a discrete-time representation — something that can now be stored, processed, and transmitted digitally.\nThis is the first key step in digital signal processing — and it's entirely grounded in the mathematics of the sampling theorem we just discussed.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
