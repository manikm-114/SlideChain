From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nWe’ve now come to a natural turning point in our discussion.\nSo far, everything we’ve studied — from Fourier series and Fourier transforms, to convolution and delta functions — has been in the continuous domain.\n\nBut now we need to ask a very important question:\u000bWhy do we work with digital signals? Why go digital?\n\nWell, here are some good reasons.\nFirst — digital signals are exact.\u000bThey’re stored as numbers, so they don’t degrade over time the way analog signals do.\n\nSecond — errors can be detected and corrected.\u000bDigital systems can automatically check for mistakes during transmission or storage — and even fix them.\n\nThird — noise and interference can be filtered out more easily.\u000bIn a digital system, it's much simpler to distinguish real data from unwanted signals.\n\nFourth — with digital transmission, we can send multiple types of information over the same line — audio, video, text — all bundled together efficiently.\n\nAnd finally — digital systems support data compression, which lets us send more information using less bandwidth.\n\nAll of this is why most modern communication, computation, and imaging systems have moved to the digital domain.\nAnd that brings us to the next part of our journey.\nLet’s study how to process digital signals next.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
