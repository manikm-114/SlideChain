From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet me now show you the other direction of this idea — and this time, we’re not going to rely on the convolution theorem directly.\n\nWe’ll start with a simple question:\u000bCan any function other than a sinusoid go into a system and come out unchanged in shape — just scaled by a constant?\nLet’s think about that.\n\nSuppose the impulse response of the system is a delta function. Then, any signal you put into that system just passes through exactly as it is — unchanged. The system does nothing.\u000bThis is an ideal system — it responds instantly and perfectly.\n\nFor example, if a camera had a perfect delta-function impulse response, every point in the scene would be captured exactly — with perfect sharpness, no blur at all.\nBut in real life, that doesn’t happen. No camera has a true delta response.\n\nIn practical systems, the impulse response is not a delta function — it’s more spread out. That means the system blurs things.\u000bEven if you feed it a sharp impulse, the output will be a wider, smeared version — not the same as the input.\nSo what does that mean in the frequency domain?\n\nWell, we know that the Fourier transform of a delta function is a constant — it's just one everywhere.\u000bThat’s because a delta contains all frequencies equally.\nBut if your impulse response is not a delta — if it’s more spread out — then its Fourier transform won’t be constant.\u000bIt will vary in frequency. That’s key.\n\nNow, let’s suppose you have some input signal — let’s call it i of t — and this signal goes into the system.\u000bYou get an output o of t, and let’s say the output has the exact same shape as the input, just scaled by some number alpha.\n\nThat is:\no of t equals alpha times i of t.\nThat sounds simple, but let’s look at what it means in the frequency domain.\nIf we take the Fourier transform of both sides, we get:\nCapital O of u equals alpha times capital I of u.\nBut from the convolution theorem, we also know:\nCapital O of u equals capital H of u times capital I of u.\nIf we compare those two expressions, we find:\nCapital H of u must equal alpha — a constant.\nBut as we just said, that would only be possible if h of t — the impulse response — is a delta function.\u000bAnd we assumed it's not.\nSo we have a contradiction.\n\nThat tells us:\u000bNo function other than a sinusoid can go through a general shift-invariant linear system and come out with the same shape — unless the system is trivial, like an ideal delta.\nOnly sinusoids have this amazing property:\u000bSinusoid in, sinusoid out — same frequency, just scaled and shifted in phase.\nThat’s what makes them so special in Fourier analysis.\u000bThat’s why convolution in the time domain becomes multiplication in the frequency domain — because the system affects each sinusoidal component independently and proportionally.\n\nSo what you see here is not just a bunch of equations — it’s a deeper logic behind the theorem.\u000bUnderstanding this helps you move beyond just memorizing formulas — it helps you truly see why Fourier analysis works the way it does.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
