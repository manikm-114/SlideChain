From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet me show you a logo I designed to help you understand the foundation of signal processing in a visual way.\nInside the circle, you’ll see the expression: delta multiplied by e to the power i theta.\u000bThat’s delta times e to the i theta.\nThis might remind you of Euler’s formula, where e to the power i theta equals cosine theta plus i times sine theta.\n\u000bSo this single term includes both a real part — the cosine — and an imaginary part — the sine.\nNow, the delta function here stands for an impulse — something that happens instantly, at a single point in time.\nTogether, the delta and the exponential show us two building blocks we’ll come back to again and again: sharp spikes and smooth waves.\nBut that’s not enough to build real-world signals.\n\nTo represent a general signal, we also need to be able to shift and scale these building blocks.\nShifting means moving a function left or right in time.\u000bScaling means stretching or compressing it, or changing its amplitude.\nFor example, with sine waves, we can change the frequency — making them faster or slower.\u000bWe can also shift them in time — or scale the height — to make them louder or softer.\n\nSo when we say “operators need to shift and scale,” we mean we need to move and adjust these basic functions — the delta and the sine wave — to create more complex signals.\nAnd with that power, we can build up any continuous or piecewise continuous function.\nThat’s the big idea behind this logo — a visual summary of how signal processing works at its core.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
