Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo here we have another view of that same example.\nThis wave has a frequency of 4 hertz — meaning it completes 4 full cycles per second.\n\nNow we’re sampling it with a very small interval, or in other words, at a very high rate: 256 samples per second. That’s far more frequent than the wave itself changes.\nAnd the result is what we call well-sampled data.\n\nAs you can see, the discrete dots — the sampling points — follow the shape of the original wave very closely.\u000bThere’s no confusion. No ambiguity. No major information is lost.\nThis is exactly what we want when digitizing a signal — the samples capture the behavior of the original continuous signal with high accuracy.\n\nHeuristically, you can just look at the plot and say: yes, these samples preserve the essence of the original wave.\nSo, in this case, we can confidently say: the sampling was successful.\nBut what if we sample too slowly?\nLet’s take a look at that next.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"Well Sampled\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\", \"o\":\"data\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"The result is what we call well-sampled data.\"}\n  ]\n}",
