Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, let’s continue line by line and see how each step connects.\nWe’re now looking at this part of the derivation — specifically the fourth equation on the slide.\n\nHere, we have the product of two terms:\na sinc function, written as sine of pi P t over pi P t,\nand the convolution with another function in square brackets.\nLet’s first focus on the sinc part. This comes from taking the inverse Fourier transform of the rectangular function in the frequency domain — the gate function we introduced earlier. When we take its inverse Fourier transform, we get a sinc function in the time domain. That’s because a rectangle in frequency always corresponds to a sinc in time. So that’s where this sine of pi P t over pi P t comes from — it’s our sinc kernel.\n\nNow, let’s turn to the function inside the brackets.\nHere, we’re performing an inverse Fourier transform on the product of two terms:\nthe Fourier transform of our original function,\nand a periodic impulse train in frequency, with spacing capital P.\nBy the convolution theorem, multiplying two functions in the frequency domain is equivalent to convolving their inverse transforms in the time domain. So we convolve the original function f of t with the inverse transform of this impulse train in the frequency domain.\n\nAnd what is the inverse transform of a periodic impulse train in frequency?\nIt gives us another periodic impulse train — this time in time — with spacing equal to one over capital P. So this entire expression simplifies to f of t convolved with a sum of shifted delta functions, spaced by one over P.\nWe can express that more clearly on the next line. The equation now becomes:\nf of t equals sinc of pi P t multiplied by the sum over all k from minus infinity to infinity of f of t times delta of t minus k over P.\nAnd because convolution with a delta function simply samples the function, this expression simplifies further — giving us the familiar formula for signal reconstruction.\n\nSo finally, we arrive at the last equation on this slide:\nf of t equals the sum over k, from negative to positive infinity,\u000bof f evaluated at k over P,\u000btimes sinc of pi times the quantity t minus k over P.\nThis is the reconstruction formula for band-limited signals. It tells us that if the signal was sampled at or above the Nyquist rate — meaning no aliasing occurred — then we can recover the original continuous function perfectly by summing shifted sinc functions, each scaled by the sampled value.\n\nThat’s the power of the sampling theorem. It doesn’t just allow us to digitize signals — it tells us exactly how to recover them.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
