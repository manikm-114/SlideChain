Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s now take a moment to revisit a topic that you’ve likely seen before — linear systems.\n\nHere, we’re looking at the classic equation: A x equals b.\u000bThat’s a system of linear equations, where A is your matrix, x is the unknown vector, and b is the observed result or measurement.\nNow, solving for x in this system is something you’ve probably done many times before — especially if you've worked through a textbook like Elementary Linear Algebra by Howard Anton, shown here.\n\nBut here's the key question for us:\u000bWhat if the unknown vector x is sparse?\nIn other words, what if most of the elements in x are actually zero — and only a few are nonzero?\nThis situation comes up a lot in modern signal processing and imaging. We no longer assume that a signal is densely sampled or has energy spread all over. Instead, we often find that signals have a sparse structure, especially when we represent them in a suitable basis, like wavelets or gradients.\n\nNow, here’s where it gets really interesting — and this is where modern theory breaks free from traditional Nyquist sampling.\nInstead of sampling a signal very densely — at twice its maximum frequency — we can sample much more sparsely, and still recover the full signal.\n\nHow?\nWe change our assumption.\u000bInstead of assuming the signal is band-limited, we assume it's sparse in some transform domain. Maybe it's sparse in the wavelet domain, or maybe the total variation is small — meaning the signal changes smoothly, or only has a few sharp transitions.\nThen, among all possible solutions that match the measurements, we choose the sparsest one.\n\nThis is the idea behind compressed sensing, and it has revolutionized the way we think about sampling and recovery.\nSo that green button on the slide — it’s there to say: pause and think. This is a major shift in the traditional mindset. It opens the door to powerful new methods for signal reconstruction from limited data — especially in imaging and beyond.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
