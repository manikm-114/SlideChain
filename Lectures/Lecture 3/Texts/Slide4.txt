Let’s build on that by comparing systems to something you’re already familiar with—functions. A function is a mathematical rule that maps each input from one set, called the domain, to an output in another set, called the range. Systems work in a similar way. They take an input, process it through interconnected elements, and produce an output.
These elements could represent anything: parts of a social system, components of a physiological system, or pieces of a mechanical system. The important point is that both functions and systems describe relationships between inputs and outputs. Our goal is to define these relationships clearly so that we can apply them to engineering and medical imaging problems.
