As engineers, much of our work revolves around systems, and one of the first things we need to do is measurement. Without measurement, we can’t really understand or control anything. In fact, measurement is at the heart of both engineering and physics. For example, in quantum mechanics, measurement plays a critical role—until we measure, we don’t truly know a system’s state. It’s like the famous thought experiment with Schrödinger’s cat: is the cat alive or dead? Only measurement collapses the uncertainty into reality.
When we perform measurements, we typically have input variables and sometimes a reference. Consider weighing an object: we place a known weight on one side of a balance and the object on the other. If the balance is level, we know the object’s weight equals the standard. Similarly, in electrical measurements, we might compare an unknown resistance or voltage against a reference using an ohmmeter or a multimeter. These devices let us measure things like current, resistance, and capacitance with precision.
More broadly, think of an instructor as a system: when the calendar says it’s time for class, that’s the input. The output is the lecture. But if something changes—say, the instructor is unwell or called away—the output changes too. This is a reminder that systems can have modifiers that influence their behavior.
