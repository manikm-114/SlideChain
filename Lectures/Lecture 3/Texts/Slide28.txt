A capacitor introduces a bit more complexity. Its voltage depends on the integral of the current over time, plus an initial condition. If we focus on the relative change—the change from that initial state—the system behaves linearly. This shows how initial conditions affect our view of linearity, and why considering relative changes can be so useful.
