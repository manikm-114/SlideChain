Welcome to this lecture on medical imaging. In our earlier sessions, we introduced some general concepts in medical imaging and provided a brief overview of essential tools, including MATLAB programming. Today, we begin what I consider the foundation section of this course. This foundation will help you build the knowledge needed to understand the major medical imaging modalities we’ll explore throughout the semester.
