Another type of system is the control system. Unlike simple measurement systems, control systems don’t just generate an output—they use that output as feedback to adjust the input or the system’s behavior.
For instance, think of a radar tracking an airplane. The radar detects the plane’s position and adjusts itself to keep the target within view. This feedback loop helps the system achieve its goal, even as conditions change. Control systems are essential in engineering whenever we want systems to adapt or correct themselves in real time.
