Together, additivity and homogeneity form what we call the superposition principle. This principle allows us to break down complex inputs and predict how the system will respond by summing simpler outputs.
Linear systems are easier to work with than nonlinear ones, and tools like Fourier analysis and convolution give us powerful ways to study them. Importantly, even nonlinear systems can often be approximated as a collection of piecewise linear systems—so mastering linear systems lays the groundwork for handling more complex situations.
