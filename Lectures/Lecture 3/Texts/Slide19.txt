Now consider homogeneity, or the scaling property. If a system produces output K1 for input F1, then scaling the input—multiplying it by some factor—should scale the output by the same factor. For example, if we double the brightness of an image input, the output image should also be twice as bright.
These two properties—additivity and homogeneity—are at the heart of linear systems. Understanding them clearly is essential, because they allow us to predict how systems behave, simplify complex problems, and build reliable imaging technologies.
