In fact, for most practical purposes, we’re satisfied with linear functions. In one dimension, this means a straight line; in two dimensions, it’s a plane; and in higher dimensions, we extend the idea further. These simple, linear relationships are easy to work with and provide the foundation for much of engineering analysis—including in medical imaging.
