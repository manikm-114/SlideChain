If a project doesn’t interest you, that’s perfectly fine—you can focus on the regular course structure of lectures, exams, and homework. Speaking of which, I’ll upload today’s homework assignment for you to download. Please submit your solutions by midnight next Tuesday. After the deadline, we’ll post the answers for your review.
Thank you for your attention today!
