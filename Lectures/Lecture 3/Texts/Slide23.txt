However, equivalence doesn’t always hold. Consider the complex conjugate operation. This system satisfies additivity: the conjugate of a sum equals the sum of the conjugates. But it fails homogeneity when the scalar is complex, because conjugating a scalar times a complex number doesn’t give the same result as scaling the conjugate by that scalar. This shows that additivity doesn’t always imply homogeneity—you really do need to check both.
