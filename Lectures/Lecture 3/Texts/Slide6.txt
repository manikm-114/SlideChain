Functions come in many forms—like sinusoidal functions, linear functions, and even more complex structures such as those defined recursively in fractal geometry. If you’re unfamiliar with fractals, they’re fascinating patterns that repeat at every scale, and I encourage you to explore them further if you’re curious. But for our purposes, it’s enough to be comfortable with regular functions and their properties.
