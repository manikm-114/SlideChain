For continuous functions, additivity and homogeneity can indeed be shown to be equivalent. For example, if a system satisfies additivity, you can use that property repeatedly to demonstrate homogeneity for integer scalars, rational scalars, and ultimately for all real scalars, thanks to continuity. Conversely, if a system satisfies homogeneity, you can reason your way back to additivity.
But this also points to a larger truth: when building formal systems—whether in mathematics or engineering—we must ensure they are logically consistent. This is no trivial task, and it’s part of what makes formal reasoning so challenging and rewarding.
