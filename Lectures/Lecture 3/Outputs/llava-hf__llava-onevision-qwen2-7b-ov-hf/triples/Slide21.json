  "raw_output": "user \nSystem:\nYou are extracting factual relations from a medical imaging lecture. Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nOver the years, some have argued that the definition of a linear system might be redundant—perhaps additivity alone implies homogeneity, or vice versa. This is an intriguing idea, and it reminds us that crafting precise definitions, like those in mathematics or geometry, is both an art and a science. Just as Euclid defined geometry with five foundational postulates, and mathematicians later debated whether all were independent, we can ask similar questions about system properties.\nIn the next few slides, we’ll look at when additivity and homogeneity are truly independent and when they might be connected. This kind of deep thinking helps us build stronger foundations for engineering practice.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"linear system\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"homogeneity\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"Some have argued that the definition of a linear system might be redundant—perhaps additivity alone implies homogeneity, or vice versa.\"}\n  ]\n}",
