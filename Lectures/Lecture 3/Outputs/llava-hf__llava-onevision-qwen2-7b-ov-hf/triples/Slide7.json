Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAnother powerful tool in mathematics is the Taylor expansion. This allows us to approximate any smooth, well-behaved function using a sum of terms: starting with a constant (the function’s value at a point), then adding linear terms based on the first derivative, and quadratic terms based on the second derivative, and so on.\nEach added term improves the approximation, as long as certain conditions are met to ensure the series converges. In engineering practice, though, we often stop at the simpler terms—constant or linear—because they offer a good balance of accuracy and simplicity. This idea of building approximations is central to how we model systems efficiently.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"Taylor expansion\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"approximation\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"This allows us to approximate any smooth, well-behaved function using a sum of terms: starting with a constant (the function’s value at a point), then adding linear terms based on the first derivative, and quadratic terms based on the second derivative, and so on.\"}\n  ]\n}",
