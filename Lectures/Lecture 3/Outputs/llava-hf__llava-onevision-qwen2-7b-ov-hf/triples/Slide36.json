Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nWhat’s remarkable about the logistic map is how its behavior changes as the growth rate increases. At low rates, the population settles to a single stable value. As the rate rises, the population starts oscillating between two values, then four, then many—and eventually behaves unpredictably, in what’s called chaotic behavior.\nThis is chaos in a mathematical sense: a deterministic system, governed by precise rules, but with outputs that seem random because they’re so sensitive to initial conditions. This is why long-term predictions, like weather forecasts, become unreliable—small differences in starting conditions can lead to dramatically different outcomes. This idea ties back to quantum mechanics, where we see that at a fundamental level, nature behaves probabilistically.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"logistic map\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"behavior\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"At low rates, the population settles to a single stable value.
