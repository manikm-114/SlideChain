Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAnother example of a nonlinear system is the biological neuron. A neuron accumulates inputs over time—small signals have no effect, but once inputs surpass a certain threshold, the neuron fires, sending an electrical impulse. This threshold mechanism helps the nervous system filter out noise and only respond to meaningful stimuli.\nWe can model this mathematically as an artificial neuron, where inputs are combined through a weighted sum (the linear part), and this sum is passed through a nonlinear function that decides whether or not to fire. This is the basic building block of artificial neural networks.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"neuron\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"artificial neuron\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"This threshold mechanism helps the nervous system filter out noise and only respond to meaningful stimuli.
