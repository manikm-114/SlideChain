Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere’s a simple illustration of what a function does. Imagine selecting a value from the domain—say, a number—and applying the function to find its corresponding value in the range. This basic idea of mapping inputs to outputs might seem simple, but it’s fundamental to everything we’re discussing.\nIn my slides, I use symbols to highlight key points: a red diamond marks something essential—concepts you should remember clearly. A green circle points out interesting but optional material, things that go beyond what you strictly need for engineering purposes. While we don’t aim to become mathematicians in this course, understanding these key ideas deeply will strengthen your grasp of medical imaging systems.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"function\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"mapping\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"Imagine selecting a value from the domain—say, a number—and applying the function to find its corresponding value in the range.
