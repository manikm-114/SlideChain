Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nToday’s lecture is straightforward. We’re going to talk about the concept of a system—a core idea that underpins everything we’ll cover in this course. If you’ve downloaded the draft of my textbook, you’ll see that this topic forms the first chapter. Reading just the first ten pages will give you a solid grasp of the key ideas.\nIn each chapter, I aim for a balanced structure: we start with three main sections, followed by a concluding section with remarks and points for deeper thought. In this lecture, we’ll begin with general systems, then narrow our focus to linear systems—which, as the name suggests, behave in a straightforward, predictable way, much like linear functions in mathematics.\nTo qualify as a linear system, two properties must be satisfied: additivity and homogeneity. Together, these form what we call the superposition principle. We’ll break these ideas down, explore when one property implies the other, and consider whether they are truly independent requirements. Lastly, we’ll touch on nonlinear systems—which are simply systems that don’t meet these linearity conditions. This will give you a broad overview of the system concepts essential for medical imaging.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"system\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"linear system\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"To qualify as a linear system, two properties must be satisfied: additivity and homogeneity.
