Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAn imaging system is a specialized type of measurement system. Consider an MRI scanner: its purpose is to measure and produce an image of a cross-section of the body’s anatomy. Ideally, this image is a faithful representation—a sharp, clear point corresponds exactly to a sharp point in the body.\nBut not all systems are created equal. A high-quality system will produce sharp, high-contrast images, while a less precise system might blur details, much like how a low-resolution camera produces softer, less defined pictures. This blurring is a key characteristic of the system and tells us a lot about its performance. In essence, imaging systems, sensing systems, and measurement systems all belong to the same family—they process inputs to produce meaningful outputs through measurement.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"MRI scanner\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"cross-section of the body’s anatomy\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"an imaging system is a specialized type of measurement system.
