Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s look at additivity first. If you know how a system responds to input F1, producing output K1, and separately how it responds to input F2, producing K2, then additivity tells us the system’s response to F1 + F2 is simply K1 + K2. This property allows us to analyze complex inputs by breaking them into simpler parts—a key advantage in engineering.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"additivity\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"system’s response to complex inputs\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"If you know how a system responds to input F1, producing output K1, and separately how it responds to input F2, producing K2, then additivity tells us the system’s response to F1 + F2 is simply K1 + K2.
