Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nOne famous example of a nonlinear system is the logistic map, a simple but powerful mathematical model. It describes how a population—say, of rabbits—evolves over time. The equation looks straightforward: next year’s population depends on this year’s population and a growth rate factor, r. But because of the nonlinear term involving the population itself, the system’s behavior changes dramatically depending on the value of r.\nWhen the population is small, growth is nearly linear. But as the population approaches the environment’s limits, growth slows—resources become scarce, and the population stabilizes or even declines. This simple model reflects how nature regulates itself.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"logistic map\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"population of rabbits\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"One famous example of a nonlinear system is the logistic map, a simple but powerful mathematical model.
