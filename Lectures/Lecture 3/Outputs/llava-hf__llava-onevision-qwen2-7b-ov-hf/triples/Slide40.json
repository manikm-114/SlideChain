Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nIf a project doesn’t interest you, that’s perfectly fine—you can focus on the regular course structure of lectures, exams, and homework. Speaking of which, I’ll upload today’s homework assignment for you to download. Please submit your solutions by midnight next Tuesday. After the deadline, we’ll post the answers for your review.\nThank you for your attention today!\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<SLIDE_TEXT>\",\"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<SLIDE_TEXT>\",\"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}",
