Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nGiven the vast complexity of all these systems, we need to narrow our focus. That’s why in this course, we concentrate on linear systems—the simplest and most important class of systems, especially in medical imaging. Linear systems are manageable to study, yet powerful in their applications. Once we master them, we’ll be ready to tackle the greater complexity of nonlinear systems.\nIn a linear system, two key properties must hold: additivity and homogeneity. Together, these form the superposition principle. We’ll explore these in detail, starting with simple cases and building up to more rigorous requirements.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"linear systems\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"simplest and most important class of systems\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"especially in medical imaging\"}\n  ]\n}",
