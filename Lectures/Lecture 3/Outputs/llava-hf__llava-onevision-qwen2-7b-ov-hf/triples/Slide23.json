Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHowever, equivalence doesn’t always hold. Consider the complex conjugate operation. This system satisfies additivity: the conjugate of a sum equals the sum of the conjugates. But it fails homogeneity when the scalar is complex, because conjugating a scalar times a complex number doesn’t give the same result as scaling the conjugate by that scalar. This shows that additivity doesn’t always imply homogeneity—you really do need to check both.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<complex conjugate operation>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<sum of complex numbers>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<additivity: the conjugate of a sum equals the sum of the conjugates.
