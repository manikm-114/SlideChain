Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nIn medical imaging and other engineering applications, we often focus not just on linear systems, but on shift-invariant linear systems. This means that if the input shifts—say, you move an object from one location to another—the output shifts in the same way.\nFor example, if I take your picture in this room, then take it again in my office, the image of you should look the same. The system’s response stays consistent despite the shift in location. This stability, or shift invariance, is a key property of many imaging systems.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1].
