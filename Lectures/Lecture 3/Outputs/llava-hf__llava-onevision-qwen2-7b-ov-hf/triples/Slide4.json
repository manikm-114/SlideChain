Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s build on that by comparing systems to something you’re already familiar with—functions. A function is a mathematical rule that maps each input from one set, called the domain, to an output in another set, called the range. Systems work in a similar way. They take an input, process it through interconnected elements, and produce an output.\nThese elements could represent anything: parts of a social system, components of a physiological system, or pieces of a mechanical system. The important point is that both functions and systems describe relationships between inputs and outputs. Our goal is to define these relationships clearly so that we can apply them to engineering and medical imaging problems.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"input\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"output\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"Systems work in a similar way.
