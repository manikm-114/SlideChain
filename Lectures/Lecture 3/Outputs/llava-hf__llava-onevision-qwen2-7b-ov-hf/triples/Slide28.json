Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nA capacitor introduces a bit more complexity. Its voltage depends on the integral of the current over time, plus an initial condition. If we focus on the relative change—the change from that initial state—the system behaves linearly. This shows how initial conditions affect our view of linearity, and why considering relative changes can be so useful.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"capacitor\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"integral\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"Its voltage depends on the integral of the current over time, plus an initial condition.\"}\n  ]\n}",
