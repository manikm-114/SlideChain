From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nWhat’s remarkable about the logistic map is how its behavior changes as the growth rate increases. At low rates, the population settles to a single stable value. As the rate rises, the population starts oscillating between two values, then four, then many—and eventually behaves unpredictably, in what’s called chaotic behavior.\nThis is chaos in a mathematical sense: a deterministic system, governed by precise rules, but with outputs that seem random because they’re so sensitive to initial conditions. This is why long-term predictions, like weather forecasts, become unreliable—small differences in starting conditions can lead to dramatically different outcomes. This idea ties back to quantum mechanics, where we see that at a fundamental level, nature behaves probabilistically.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
