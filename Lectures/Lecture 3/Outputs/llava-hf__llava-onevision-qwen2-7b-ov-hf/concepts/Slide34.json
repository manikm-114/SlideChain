From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s finish this part of our discussion by touching briefly on nonlinear systems. This is a topic marked with a green button—so it’s something nice to know, not required at the core level of this course. Nonlinear science is a relatively new and complex area. Unlike linear systems, nonlinear equations are often difficult, or even impossible, to solve exactly. But thanks to modern computing, we can discretize these equations and compute solutions numerically—even if we have to do so through brute force.\nBeyond practical applications, nonlinear systems are fascinating because they produce surprising, often counterintuitive phenomena. And anything that defies our intuition naturally grabs our interest.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"nonlinear\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"nonlinear equations\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"numerical solutions\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"discretization\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"brute force\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"counterintuitive phenomena\", \"category\": \"physics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"intuition\", \"category\": \"psychology\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"Unlike linear systems, nonlinear equations are often difficult, or even impossible, to solve exactly.
