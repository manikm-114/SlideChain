  "raw_output": "user \nSystem:\nYou are an expert educator in medical imaging. From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nFunctions come in many forms—like sinusoidal functions, linear functions, and even more complex structures such as those defined recursively in fractal geometry. If you’re unfamiliar with fractals, they’re fascinating patterns that repeat at every scale, and I encourage you to explore them further if you’re curious. But for our purposes, it’s enough to be comfortable with regular functions and their properties.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"sinusoidal functions\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"linear functions\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"fractal geometry\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"functions\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"regular functions\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"properties\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"If you’re unfamiliar with fractals, they’re fascinating patterns that repeat at every scale, and I encourage you to explore them further if you’re curious.
