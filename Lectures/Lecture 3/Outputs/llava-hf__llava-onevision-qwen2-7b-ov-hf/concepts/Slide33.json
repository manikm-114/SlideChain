From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nMathematically, shift invariance means that if the input shifts by some amount—say a—the output shifts by the same amount. The system’s operation stays consistent, no matter where or when the input occurs.\nShift invariance, combined with linearity, gives us powerful tools for analyzing systems. Together, they allow us to model and predict system behavior with confidence, whether in medical imaging, signal processing, or other fields of engineering.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"shift invariance\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"linearity\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"systems\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"confidence\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"modeling\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"predicting\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"behavior\", \"category\": \"physics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"medical imaging\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"signal processing\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"frequency domain\", \"category\": \"frequency_domain\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"Mathematically, shift invariance means that if the input shifts by some amount—say a—the output shifts by the same amount.
