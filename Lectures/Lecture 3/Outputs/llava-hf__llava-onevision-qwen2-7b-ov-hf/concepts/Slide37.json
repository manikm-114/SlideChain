From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAnother example of a nonlinear system is the biological neuron. A neuron accumulates inputs over time—small signals have no effect, but once inputs surpass a certain threshold, the neuron fires, sending an electrical impulse. This threshold mechanism helps the nervous system filter out noise and only respond to meaningful stimuli.\nWe can model this mathematically as an artificial neuron, where inputs are combined through a weighted sum (the linear part), and this sum is passed through a nonlinear function that decides whether or not to fire. This is the basic building block of artificial neural networks.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"neuron\", \"category\": \"anatomy\"},\n    {\"term\": \"threshold mechanism\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"artificial neuron\", \"category\": \"ai_ml\"},\n    {\"term\": \"weighted sum\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"nonlinear function\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"artificial neural network\", \"category\": \"ai_ml\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"Another example of a nonlinear system is the biological neuron.\", \"This threshold mechanism helps the nervous system filter out noise and only respond to meaningful stimuli.\", \"We can model this mathematically as an artificial neuron, where inputs are combined through a weighted sum (the linear part), and this sum is passed through a nonlinear function that decides whether or not to fire.
