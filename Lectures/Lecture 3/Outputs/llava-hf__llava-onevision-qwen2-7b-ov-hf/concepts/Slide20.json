From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s test these ideas with a few examples. Suppose we have a system that maps positive numbers, x, to the square root of x. Is this system linear? Well, while the output is zero when the input is zero, that alone doesn’t make a system linear. Remember, true linearity requires both additivity and homogeneity. The square root function doesn’t satisfy either—if you take two inputs and sum their square roots, that doesn’t equal the square root of the sum, and scaling the input doesn’t scale the output proportionally.\nOn the other hand, consider a linear transformation in three-dimensional space, like multiplying a vector by a 3×3 matrix. This kind of operation satisfies both additivity and homogeneity, making it a linear system. Similarly, mathematical operations like integration and differentiation also qualify as linear operators. They obey the superposition principle, which combines both key properties of linearity in a compact form.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
