From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSimilarly, it’s possible to have homogeneity without additivity. Imagine a function that applies one slope if the input is rational and another slope if it’s irrational. Scaling works consistently because multiplying by a rational scalar preserves the input’s type (rational or irrational), so homogeneity holds. But if you add two irrational inputs that sum to a rational number, the slopes change—and additivity breaks down.\nThese examples remind us why linear systems require both properties. We can’t shortcut the definition by assuming one implies the other in all cases.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
