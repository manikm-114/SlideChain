From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAs engineers, we often think of the world in terms of systems. We use mathematical operators—like L or O—to describe how a system transforms an input into an output. If you feed an input signal, V, into a system, the output, W, represents how that signal is modified.\nThese inputs and outputs can take many forms: time-dependent signals, images, tensors, or even discrete data sets like color values in an image. The concept is general: a system processes an input and produces an output, just as a function maps domain to range.\nIn medical imaging, we apply this thinking to devices like CT scanners, where the entire system transforms physical signals into diagnostic images. And as we analyze these systems, we rely on mathematical relationships to describe their behavior in precise terms. This distinction between thinking as engineers about systems and as mathematicians about abstract functions is subtle but important as we move forward.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
