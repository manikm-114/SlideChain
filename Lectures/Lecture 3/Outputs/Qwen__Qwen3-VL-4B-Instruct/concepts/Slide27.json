From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s consider classic electrical components. A resistor follows Ohm’s law: V = IR. This is a linear relationship—double the current, and the voltage doubles. Whether we write V = IR or I = V/R, the linearity remains clear. This is a simple, familiar example of a linear system.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
