From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s finish this part of our discussion by touching briefly on nonlinear systems. This is a topic marked with a green button—so it’s something nice to know, not required at the core level of this course. Nonlinear science is a relatively new and complex area. Unlike linear systems, nonlinear equations are often difficult, or even impossible, to solve exactly. But thanks to modern computing, we can discretize these equations and compute solutions numerically—even if we have to do so through brute force.\nBeyond practical applications, nonlinear systems are fascinating because they produce surprising, often counterintuitive phenomena. And anything that defies our intuition naturally grabs our interest.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
