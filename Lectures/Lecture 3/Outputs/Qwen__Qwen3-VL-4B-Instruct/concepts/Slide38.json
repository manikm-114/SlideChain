From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nWhen we connect these artificial neurons in layers, we create a neural network. With many layers, we have what’s called a deep neural network—the foundation of modern deep learning.\nIn these networks, the lower layers detect simple features, like edges or corners, while higher layers learn more abstract patterns, like faces or traffic signs. Deep neural networks now drive advances in fields from facial recognition to self-driving cars. This is a powerful example of combining linear and nonlinear elements to solve complex problems.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
