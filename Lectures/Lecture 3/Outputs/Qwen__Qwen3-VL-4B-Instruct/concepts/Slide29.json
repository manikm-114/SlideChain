From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAn inductor works similarly, but with current depending on the integral of voltage over time, or voltage depending on the derivative of current. Again, if we account for initial conditions, we can apply linear system theory to analyze these components effectively.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
