From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s look at additivity first. If you know how a system responds to input F1, producing output K1, and separately how it responds to input F2, producing K2, then additivity tells us the system’s response to F1 + F2 is simply K1 + K2. This property allows us to analyze complex inputs by breaking them into simpler parts—a key advantage in engineering.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
