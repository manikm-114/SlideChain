From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nIn fact, for most practical purposes, we’re satisfied with linear functions. In one dimension, this means a straight line; in two dimensions, it’s a plane; and in higher dimensions, we extend the idea further. These simple, linear relationships are easy to work with and provide the foundation for much of engineering analysis—including in medical imaging.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
