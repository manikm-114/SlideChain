From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLooking ahead, we can expect increasing convergence between robotic systems and human systems. Technologies like brain-machine interfaces are already emerging, with the potential to enhance memory, reasoning, and other cognitive functions. This merging of neuroscience and artificial intelligence represents an exciting frontier. As I once heard in a talk: physics helps us understand the external world, while neuroscience helps us understand ourselves. Bringing these fields together may fundamentally reshape what it means to be human.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
