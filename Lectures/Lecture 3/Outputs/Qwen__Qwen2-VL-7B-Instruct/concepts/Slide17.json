From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nGiven the vast complexity of all these systems, we need to narrow our focus. That’s why in this course, we concentrate on linear systems—the simplest and most important class of systems, especially in medical imaging. Linear systems are manageable to study, yet powerful in their applications. Once we master them, we’ll be ready to tackle the greater complexity of nonlinear systems.\nIn a linear system, two key properties must hold: additivity and homogeneity. Together, these form the superposition principle. We’ll explore these in detail, starting with simple cases and building up to more rigorous requirements.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
