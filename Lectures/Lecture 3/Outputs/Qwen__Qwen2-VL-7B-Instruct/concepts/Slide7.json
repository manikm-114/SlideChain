From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAnother powerful tool in mathematics is the Taylor expansion. This allows us to approximate any smooth, well-behaved function using a sum of terms: starting with a constant (the function’s value at a point), then adding linear terms based on the first derivative, and quadratic terms based on the second derivative, and so on.\nEach added term improves the approximation, as long as certain conditions are met to ensure the series converges. In engineering practice, though, we often stop at the simpler terms—constant or linear—because they offer a good balance of accuracy and simplicity. This idea of building approximations is central to how we model systems efficiently.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
