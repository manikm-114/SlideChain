From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nOne famous example of a nonlinear system is the logistic map, a simple but powerful mathematical model. It describes how a population—say, of rabbits—evolves over time. The equation looks straightforward: next year’s population depends on this year’s population and a growth rate factor, r. But because of the nonlinear term involving the population itself, the system’s behavior changes dramatically depending on the value of r.\nWhen the population is small, growth is nearly linear. But as the population approaches the environment’s limits, growth slows—resources become scarce, and the population stabilizes or even declines. This simple model reflects how nature regulates itself.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.

      "One famous example of a nonlinear system is the logistic map, a simple but powerful mathematical model. It describes how a population-say, of rabbits-evolves over time. The equation looks straightforward: next year's population depends on this year's population and a growth rate factor, r. But because of the nonlinear term involving the population itself, the system's behavior changes dramatically depending on the value of r. When the population is small, growth is nearly linear. But as the population approaches the environment's limits, growth slows-resources become scarce, and the population stabilizes or even declines.
