From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAnother example of a nonlinear system is the biological neuron. A neuron accumulates inputs over time—small signals have no effect, but once inputs surpass a certain threshold, the neuron fires, sending an electrical impulse. This threshold mechanism helps the nervous system filter out noise and only respond to meaningful stimuli.\nWe can model this mathematically as an artificial neuron, where inputs are combined through a weighted sum (the linear part), and this sum is passed through a nonlinear function that decides whether or not to fire. This is the basic building block of artificial neural networks.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
