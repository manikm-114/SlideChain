From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nIf a project doesn’t interest you, that’s perfectly fine—you can focus on the regular course structure of lectures, exams, and homework. Speaking of which, I’ll upload today’s homework assignment for you to download. Please submit your solutions by midnight next Tuesday. After the deadline, we’ll post the answers for your review.\nThank you for your attention today!\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
