From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHowever, equivalence doesn’t always hold. Consider the complex conjugate operation. This system satisfies additivity: the conjugate of a sum equals the sum of the conjugates. But it fails homogeneity when the scalar is complex, because conjugating a scalar times a complex number doesn’t give the same result as scaling the conjugate by that scalar. This shows that additivity doesn’t always imply homogeneity—you really do need to check both.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
