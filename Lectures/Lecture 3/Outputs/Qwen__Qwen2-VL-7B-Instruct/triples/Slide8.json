Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nIn fact, for most practical purposes, we’re satisfied with linear functions. In one dimension, this means a straight line; in two dimensions, it’s a plane; and in higher dimensions, we extend the idea further. These simple, linear relationships are easy to work with and provide the foundation for much of engineering analysis—including in medical imaging.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
