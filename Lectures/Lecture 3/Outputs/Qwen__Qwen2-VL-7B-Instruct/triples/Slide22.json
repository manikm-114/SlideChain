Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nFor continuous functions, additivity and homogeneity can indeed be shown to be equivalent. For example, if a system satisfies additivity, you can use that property repeatedly to demonstrate homogeneity for integer scalars, rational scalars, and ultimately for all real scalars, thanks to continuity. Conversely, if a system satisfies homogeneity, you can reason your way back to additivity.\nBut this also points to a larger truth: when building formal systems—whether in mathematics or engineering—we must ensure they are logically consistent. This is no trivial task, and it’s part of what makes formal reasoning so challenging and rewarding.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"Continuous functions\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"Additivity and homogeneity\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"For continuous functions, additivity and homogeneity can indeed be shown to be equivalent.\"}\n  ]\n}",
