Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nOne subtle idea is relative linearity. A system’s behavior might depend on the chosen coordinate system or reference point. For example, a linear function with an intercept (like y = mx + b) is still linear in its relative changes. If you redefine the origin to subtract out b, it behaves like a linear function passing through zero.\nSimilarly, for systems, we often focus on relative changes in input and output rather than absolute values. This helps us apply linear system theory even when the system’s baseline isn’t perfectly aligned with the origin.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
