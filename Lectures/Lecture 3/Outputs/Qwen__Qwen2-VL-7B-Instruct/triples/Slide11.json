Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAn imaging system is a specialized type of measurement system. Consider an MRI scanner: its purpose is to measure and produce an image of a cross-section of the body’s anatomy. Ideally, this image is a faithful representation—a sharp, clear point corresponds exactly to a sharp point in the body.\nBut not all systems are created equal. A high-quality system will produce sharp, high-contrast images, while a less precise system might blur details, much like how a low-resolution camera produces softer, less defined pictures. This blurring is a key characteristic of the system and tells us a lot about its performance. In essence, imaging systems, sensing systems, and measurement systems all belong to the same family—they process inputs to produce meaningful outputs through measurement.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
