Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nToday, robotic systems represent a hot area of control system development. From robots that provide assistance in hotels or nursing homes to those that help care for infants, these systems combine control with a degree of machine intelligence. Their adaptability and responsiveness open up incredible possibilities in both industry and healthcare.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
