Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s move on to our second example — the triangle function.\n\nThis function, often called the triangular function, is shaped just like its name suggests — a triangle. It peaks at 1 when x equals 0, and then it decreases linearly to zero as x moves out to minus 1 and plus 1. Outside of that range, the value is zero.\n\nMathematically, it’s defined like this: one minus the absolute value of x when x is between negative 1 and 1, and zero otherwise.\nSo what we want to do now is find its Fourier transform.\n\nIn other words, we want to express this smooth, non-periodic triangular function as a combination of infinitely many sinusoidal waves — just like we did with the gate function.\n\nWe’ll add up all these waves — each with a different frequency and amplitude — and by doing so, we’ll be able to reconstruct this triangle shape exactly.\nThat’s the idea behind Fourier transform: take a function, no matter how it looks, and rewrite it as a sum of wave components. Each component carries part of the shape — and when you combine them all, you get the original back.\nLet’s see what that looks like in this case.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"s\": \"triangle function\",\n      \"p\": \"reconstructs_with\",\n      \"o\": \"infinitely many sinusoidal waves\",\n      \"modalities\": [\"text\", \"image\"],\n      \"confidence\": 0.95,\n      \"evidence\": \"We’ll add up all these waves — each with a different frequency and amplitude — and by doing so, we’ll be able to reconstruct this triangle shape exactly.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"s\": \"triangle function\",\n      \"p\": \"represents\",\n      \"o\": \"a triangle\",\n      \"modalities\": [\"text\", \"image\"],\n      \"confidence\": 0.95,\n      \"evidence\": \"This function, often called the triangular function, is shaped just like its name suggests — a triangle.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"s\": \"triangle function\",\n      \"p\": \"produces\",\n      \"o\": \"a combination of sinusoidal waves\",\n      \"modalities\": [\"text\", \"image\"],\n      \"confidence\": 0.95,\n      \"evidence\": \"We want to express this smooth, non-periodic triangular function as a combination of infinitely many sinusoidal waves.\"\n    }",
