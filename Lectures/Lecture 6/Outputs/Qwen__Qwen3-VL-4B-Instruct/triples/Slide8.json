Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nBy now, you might be wondering — why go through all this? Why even bother with the Fourier transform?\nWell, let’s take a step back and think with common sense.\n\nWe started with a function — f of t — and we’ve looked at several ways to represent it. First, we saw it as a sum of impulses. Then, as a sum of waves — sines and cosines. Each of these views gives us a different lens to understand the same signal.\nAnd that’s the point. Multiple perspectives give us more flexibility and smarter strategies for solving problems.\n\nIn real life, when you're facing a tough task, what do you usually do? You don’t try to tackle it head-on in the hardest way possible. You try to simplify it. You look for shortcuts. You use tools that make the problem easier.\nThat’s exactly what we’re doing with Fourier analysis.\nSometimes a problem looks really messy in the time domain — but if we switch to the Fourier domain, that same problem might become simple and elegant.\n\nHere’s an analogy: imagine trying to do multiplication using Roman numerals. It’s a nightmare! But switch to Arabic numerals — or even binary — and suddenly, multiplication becomes easy. Especially for computers.\nSo choosing the right representation can make all the difference.\nThat’s what the Fourier transform is all about. It gives us a new way to look at a function — in terms of its frequency content — and often, that view makes analysis or computation much simpler.\n\nThere’s also a deeper strategy here:\u000bSometimes a function is complicated as a whole, but if we break it down into smaller, simpler parts, we can understand it better.\nThis is the classic divide and conquer approach.\nWe’ve already seen this with impulse decomposition. If you know how a system responds to a single impulse, then you can figure out how it will respond to a complicated signal — just by adding up the responses to each impulse.\nThe same logic applies to sine waves — if you understand how a system reacts to one sine wave, and you can express a signal as a sum of sine waves, then you’ve got the whole picture.\n\nSo, in short, Fourier analysis follows two powerful principles:\nUse simple tools to solve complex problems.\nDivide big problems into small, manageable pieces.\nAnd that’s what we’re building toward with the Fourier transform.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
