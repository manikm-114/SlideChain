Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s take this a step further and look at low-pass and high-pass filtering using the Fourier transform.\n\nStart with the image on the far left — this is our original image of a building. Below it, you see the corresponding frequency spectrum. It contains both low-frequency components, which encode smooth variations like brightness and shading, and high-frequency components, which capture edges and fine details.\n\nNow look at the middle column.\nHere, we’ve applied a low-pass filter. That means we kept only the low-frequency components — those near the center of the Fourier spectrum — and removed the rest. You can see the filtered spectrum just below. The result, shown in the middle image above, is a smoothed version of the original — the fine details are gone, and only the broad, soft structures remain.\n\nNext, we move to the rightmost column.\nThis time we’ve done the opposite. We removed the low frequencies and kept only a selected band of high-frequency components. You can see that in the frequency plot — a ring where the center is zeroed out. The corresponding spatial image above now reveals only the edges — the sharp transitions in intensity.\nSo by simply choosing which frequency bands to preserve or remove, we can control the kind of information we keep — soft versus sharp, background versus boundary.\n\nThis is another powerful reason why we often work in the frequency domain — filtering becomes intuitive and flexible.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
