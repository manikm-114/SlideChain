Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAlright — now let’s take the next step together.\nEarlier, we learned how to calculate the Fourier coefficient c n for a function with arbitrary period T. Now, we’re going to insert that expression for c n directly into the Fourier series formula.\n\nWhat happens when we do that?\nWell, here’s what we get: we take the formula for c n — which is an integral — and plug it into the sum. So now, each term in the series contains an inner product multiplied by a complex exponential.\n\nNotice this part out front: 1 over capital T. This shows up because we’re working over a general period T, not the unit interval. So we need to normalize — or average — over the full interval from minus T over 2 to plus T over 2.\nThis 1 over T acts like a scaling factor — a way of balancing the sum so that everything works out correctly.\nNow look inside the brackets. What we’re really doing here is taking the inner product of two functions:\nOne is f of t,\nAnd the other is the complex exponential e to the power minus i 2 pi n t over T.\n\nYou multiply them together point by point, and then integrate over the interval. That’s what we mean by an inner product in this context.\nAnd we’re doing this for many values of n, both negative and positive. So you can imagine we’re computing inner products at a whole series of frequency points — where each frequency is n divided by T.\n\nAs T becomes large, the spacing between these frequencies — that is, the difference between one n over T and the next — becomes smaller and smaller. Eventually, this sum will start to resemble an integral over a continuous range of frequencies, and that’s the key idea behind the Fourier transform.\n\nSo, to summarize:\u000bWe’re inserting the formula for c n, and that gives us a series of inner products across many frequencies, with a spacing of delta u equals 1 over T. This step sets us up perfectly to move from a discrete sum to a continuous integral — which is what the Fourier transform is all about.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
