From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo let’s take a step back and ask—why is convolution in the time domain equivalent to multiplication in the frequency domain?\n\nTo understand this, let’s think about a shift-invariant linear system. If you feed a sinusoidal signal into such a system, the output will also be sinusoidal. And—here’s the key—it will be at the same frequency. The system might change the amplitude or the phase, but it doesn’t generate new frequencies. That’s the hallmark of a shift-invariant, or time-invariant, linear system.\nThis leads to a deep and beautiful conclusion. If sinusoidal signals are preserved in shape and frequency, then the effect of the system on each frequency component can be described by a single number—just a scaling factor that depends on frequency.\n\nSo, imagine you take any general signal, and you decompose it into a sum of sinusoidal components. The system acts on each component individually, scaling each one by a different amount. That’s exactly what multiplication looks like in the Fourier domain. Each frequency is being multiplied by its own gain factor.\nThat’s why convolution in the time domain turns into multiplication in the frequency domain.\n\nNow, here's something important: this only works because of that special property of sinusoids. Among all functions, only sinusoids maintain their shape when passing through a shift-invariant linear system. Delta functions, for instance, don’t behave that way—they get transformed into something entirely different. But a cosine remains a cosine. A sine remains a sine. Just possibly scaled or phase-shifted.\nAnd this is what makes the Fourier transform so unique. It’s the only transform for which the convolution theorem holds—because only sinusoids have this invariance.\n\nYou might wonder—could we define a similar convolution theorem using other transforms, like wavelet transforms or Hadamard transforms? The answer is no. Those basis functions don’t have this shape-preserving property under linear shift-invariant systems. So the convolution theorem doesn’t hold for them.\n\nNow if you’re curious, you can actually find some advanced papers on this. Try searching for “characterization of the convolution theorem.” You’ll find rigorous mathematical proofs that ultimately say the same thing: the convolution theorem is special to the Fourier transform.\nBut you don’t need pages of math to get the intuition. If a function keeps its shape through a system, and we can describe the system’s effect with a frequency-dependent multiplier, then that’s multiplication in the Fourier domain.\nAnd if you're passionate about the math behind this, you could even write a short paper exploring this idea. I'd be happy to discuss it with you.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
