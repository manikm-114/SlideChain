From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s now look at a powerful application of the 2D Fourier transform — noise suppression.\nTake a look at the image on the left. It’s a noisy version of a familiar test image — lots of random graininess, especially in the background and darker areas.\n\nNow, if we perform a 2D Fourier transform — which we indicate here by \"F T\" — we move from the spatial domain to the frequency domain. The result is this bottom-left image, which shows the frequency spectrum of the noisy image.\nNotice something important: most of the meaningful image information is concentrated around the center, which corresponds to the low-frequency components. But the noise is spread out — especially toward the edges — as high-frequency speckles.\nAnd this gives us an idea.\n\nWhat if we simply suppress or remove those high-frequency components? That’s what we’re doing on the bottom-right: we apply a mask — setting the noisy high-frequency regions to zero, while keeping only the central, low-frequency region.\n\nThen we perform the inverse Fourier transform — marked here as \"I F T\" — to convert back to the spatial domain.\nAnd just like that, we get a much cleaner version of the original image. Most of the noise is gone, and the essential structure is preserved.\nThis is one of the key strengths of working in the frequency domain. Certain operations — like filtering or noise removal — can be done more easily, more effectively, and sometimes more intuitively after transformation.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
