From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo now that we’ve covered the Fourier series — and we’ve seen why changing representations can make problems easier — it’s time to dive into the main topic of today’s lecture: the Fourier transform.\n\nThis corresponds to Chapter 4 in the book draft I shared with you. I do plan to revise it soon — polish up some explanations and fix a few typos — and I’ll send you the updated version once it’s ready.\n\nHere’s how we’ll structure today’s lecture:\nFirst, in Section 1, we’ll talk about how the Fourier transform is derived from the Fourier series. This transition is logical and elegant, and it gives us a solid foundation for everything that follows.\n\nThen, in Section 2, we’ll explore some of the most important properties of the Fourier transform. These properties aren’t just mathematical curiosities — they’re practical tools used in signal processing, imaging, and many other fields.\n\nAfter that, in Section 3, we’ll extend our thinking to higher dimensions. I’ll show you how the Fourier transform applies not just to one-dimensional signals, but also to images — and beyond. I’ll even walk you through an example where converting an image to the Fourier domain makes it easy to remove noise.\n\nFinally, in Section 4, we’ll wrap things up with a few remarks and reflections.\n\nSo by the end of this lecture, you should not only understand the mathematical structure of the Fourier transform, but also see its real-world value, especially in areas like medical imaging.\nLet’s get started with the first section: the derivation of the Fourier transform.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
