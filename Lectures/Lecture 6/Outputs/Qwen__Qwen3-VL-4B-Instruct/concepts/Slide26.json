From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s take a closer look at the scaling property of the Fourier transform.\nHere’s the idea. Suppose we have a function, f of t. And now, instead of f of t, we look at f of a times t, where a is just some constant — not zero.\n\nWe’re changing the time scale. The question is: what happens to its Fourier transform?\nWell, this depends on whether a is positive or negative. But in both cases, something interesting happens.\nFirst, let’s say a is greater than zero.\nWe plug f of a t into the Fourier transform formula. If you do the math — which involves changing variables and rearranging terms — you end up with this:\nThe Fourier transform of f of a t becomes\u000bone divided by a, times F of s divided by a.\n\nSo what does that mean?\nIf we stretch the function in time — that is, make it slower — its frequency content gets compressed.\u000bAnd if we squeeze it in time — make it faster — the frequency content stretches out.\n\nNow, what if a is less than zero?\nIn that case, the same formula still works, but with a minus sign that comes from flipping the limits of integration.\n\nSo we just take the absolute value of a, and the final result becomes:\nThe Fourier transform of f of a t equals\u000bone over the absolute value of a, times F of s over a.\n\nSo in short:\u000bScaling in time causes the opposite effect in frequency.\u000bThat’s the scaling property.\nAnd this is one more way to see how time and frequency are tightly connected in the Fourier world.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
