From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nWelcome back, everyone.\n\nToday, we move one step further in our journey — from the Fourier series to the Fourier transform. This is a big transition, and it’s a powerful one. So, what exactly changes when we move from a series to a transform? That’s what we’ll uncover together in this lecture.\n\nBefore we begin, I want to emphasize something important. You need to have a solid understanding of the Fourier series first. The transform builds directly on those ideas. If you’re still feeling confused about Fourier series — don’t worry — but do take action. You can interact with ChatGPT, discuss with your classmates, review the lecture materials, and review the chapter I wrote. You can also search online for different explanations or examples that make more sense to you. Group discussions can be constructive.\n\nFourier analysis is fundamental — not just for this course, but for understanding medical imaging technologies down the line. I want to make sure no one gets left behind here. Because if you miss this foundation, the rest of the material will feel considerably harder.\nAlright — let’s dive in.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
