From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s now talk about one of the most powerful tools in the Fourier world — the convolution theorem.\n\nIn plain terms, the convolution theorem says this:\nConvolution in the time domain becomes multiplication in the frequency domain.\n\nLet me say that again, but clearly:\u000bIf you have two functions — let’s call them f of t and g of t — and you convolve them together, then their Fourier transform is simply the product of their individual transforms.\nSo:\u000bIf the Fourier transform of f of t is capital F of s,\u000band the transform of g of t is capital G of s,\u000bthen the transform of f convolved with g is F of s times G of s.\nThat’s the core idea.\n\nNow why does this matter?\nBecause convolution — though useful — is often hard to compute directly.\u000bIt involves flipping one function, shifting it, multiplying, and integrating. That’s a lot of work!\nBut thanks to this theorem, we can skip all that.\u000bInstead, we go to the frequency domain, multiply two functions — much simpler — and then just come back to the time domain using an inverse transform.\n\nLet’s walk through a concrete example.\nThink about a gate function — also called a rectangular pulse. Its Fourier transform is a sinc function — which looks like a smooth wave with side ripples.\nNow, if we take two gate functions and convolve them in time, we get a triangle function.\n\nSo what happens in the frequency domain?\nEach gate becomes a sinc function. When we multiply the two sinc functions together, we get sinc squared.\nThat is — sinc of s times sinc of s gives you sinc squared of s.\n\nSo the triangle function — which was a convolution of two gates — has a Fourier transform equal to sinc squared.\nThat’s a beautiful result, and it all comes from the convolution theorem.\nIt also shows how Fourier analysis turns complicated operations into simpler ones, especially in engineering, signal processing, and physics.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
