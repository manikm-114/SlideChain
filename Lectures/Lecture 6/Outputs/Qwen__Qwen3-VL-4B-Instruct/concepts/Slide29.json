From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow here's one of the most important Fourier transform pairs — the impulse train, also called the comb function.\nThink of it this way:\u000b\nWe place delta functions at evenly spaced intervals — for example, every delta t along the time axis.\u000bThis gives us a repeating sequence of sharp spikes — like the teeth of a comb — so we call it a comb function in time.\nMathematically, we write this as the sum of delta of t minus n delta t, summed over all integers n.\u000bThat just means we have delta functions at 0, at delta t, at 2 delta t, and so on, going both directions.\n\nNow here’s the key:\u000bWhen we take the Fourier transform of this comb in time, what do we get?\nSurprisingly, we get another comb — this time in the frequency domain.\u000bBut the spacing changes — instead of delta t, the spikes are now spaced by 1 over delta t.\nSo if we sample more tightly in time, the frequency comb spreads out.\u000bAnd if we stretch out the spacing in time, the frequency spikes get closer together.\nThis is exactly the scaling property we saw earlier — a tight structure in one domain leads to a broad structure in the other.\n\nNow you might be wondering — how do we handle all these delta functions?\u000bThey’re not ordinary functions — they’re distributions or generalized functions.\u000bAnd we’re dealing with an infinite sum of them.\nThis touches on deeper mathematics — involving convergence and rigor — but for our purposes, this formula holds and is extremely useful.\u000bWe’ll come back to this paired comb concept again in the next lecture, especially when we talk about sampling theory and the Fourier series.\n\nSo just remember:\u000bA comb in time transforms to a comb in frequency.\u000bAnd their spacing is inversely related — one over the other.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
