From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nYou’ve actually seen this slide before — it’s a summary of what we covered in the last lecture, and now it serves as our starting point for deriving the Fourier transform.\n\nLet’s quickly revisit the main idea:\nWe said that any arbitrary function can be treated as if it were periodic, defined over a fixed interval. In this case, we’re looking at a symmetric interval — from minus capital T over 2 to plus capital T over 2.\n\nWithin this interval, we can represent the function f of t as a sum of sinusoidal components — specifically, complex exponentials of the form:\ne to the power i times 2 pi n, times t over T.\nThis is a compact way to write sine and cosine waves using Euler’s formula. So even though the expression looks complex, it represents a mix of sine and cosine waves at various frequencies, where n runs from minus infinity to plus infinity.\nAnd just like before, each component has a corresponding coefficient, which tells us how much of that wave appears in the overall function.\n\nTo compute the coefficient c n, we use the formula at the bottom:\nc n equals 1 over capital T, times the integral from minus T over 2 to T over 2, of e to the minus i 2 pi n t over T, times f of t, with respect to t.\nThis is just an inner product — projecting f of t onto a complex exponential basis function. That projection gives us the weight, or the contribution, of that particular frequency.\n\nSo, this slide wraps up all the key ideas from the Fourier series — including:\nTreating functions as periodic,\nExpressing them with complex exponentials,\nAnd computing coefficients through integration.\nWith this solid foundation in place, we’re now ready to take the next step — and derive the Fourier transform, which generalizes everything we’ve done so far.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
