From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow that we’ve built up all the ideas step by step, let’s bring it all together into one elegant concept — the Fourier transform pair.\nWhat you see on this slide captures the very heart of Fourier analysis.\n\nLet’s begin with the first equation, which is the forward Fourier transform.\u000bSuppose you have a signal in the time domain, which we’ll call f of t. The goal is to understand how much of each frequency is present in that signal.\n\nSo how do we do that?\nWe project f of t onto a family of complex exponential functions. These functions look like e to the power minus i, 2 pi, u, t, where u is the frequency. This projection acts like an inner product, telling us how strongly f of t resonates with each frequency component.\nWhen we integrate this product across all time, we obtain f hat of u, also called the frequency spectrum or the Fourier transform of f of t.\nSo this first equation maps the signal from the time domain to the frequency domain.\n\nNow look at the second equation. This is the inverse Fourier transform.\nHere, we take all those frequency components — that is, each f hat of u — and multiply them by their corresponding complex exponential, this time e to the power i, two pi, u, t. Then, we integrate over all frequencies.\nAnd what do we get?\u000bWe reconstruct the original signal — f of t — exactly.\nSo in summary, the forward transform takes you from time to frequency, and the inverse transform brings you back from frequency to time.\u000bThat’s the two-way mapping shown symbolically at the bottom:\u000bf of t goes to f hat of u, and back again.\n\nNow, a few mathematical notes to make this complete:\nFirst — this transform assumes that f of t is square-integrable, meaning if you square the function and integrate it over all time, the total is finite. This ensures convergence and makes the math work properly.\n\nSecond — even though we’re dealing with a non-periodic function here, the idea still grows out of the Fourier series. Remember what happens when the period of a function becomes very large — the discrete set of frequency components becomes a continuous spectrum. The Fourier transform is essentially the limit of the Fourier series as the period tends to infinity.\nAnd finally — here’s a nice geometric interpretation.\nThink of projecting a 3D vector onto the x, y, and z axes.\u000b\nIn the same way, when we apply the Fourier transform, we’re projecting our function onto an infinite set of sine and cosine waves — or more precisely, complex exponentials. Each frequency contributes a tiny slice of the original signal.\u000bAnd by adding all those slices back together — using integration — we reconstruct the full signal.\n\nThis isn’t just a clever trick.\u000bIt’s one of the most powerful tools in all of engineering, physics, and mathematics.\u000bIt lets us analyze and manipulate signals in both time and frequency — without losing any information.\nWith this foundational concept in place, we’re ready to explore some practical examples and dive deeper into the properties of the Fourier transform.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
