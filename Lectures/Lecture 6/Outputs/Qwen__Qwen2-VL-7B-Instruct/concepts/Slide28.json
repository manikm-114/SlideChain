From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s talk about a beautiful and surprising property of the Fourier transform — its connection to derivatives.\nSuppose we start with a function, f of t, and its Fourier transform is capital F of s.\n\nNow you might ask:\u000bWhat happens if we take the derivative of f — that is, f prime of t — and then perform the Fourier transform?\nThe answer is elegant:\u000bTaking a derivative in time becomes multiplication in the frequency domain.\n\nMore precisely,\u000bThe Fourier transform of f ' of t is just 2 pi i s times the Fourier transform of f.\u000bSo again, taking a derivative becomes a simple multiplication — and the factor depends on frequency.\nThere’s also a second version of this rule:\u000bIf you take the derivative of the Fourier transform itself with respect to s,\u000bThat’s the same as applying -2 pi i t to f of t — and then transforming it.\n\nSo in summary:\nDerivatives in one domain correspond to multiplications in the other domain.\nAnd this duality works both ways — from time to frequency, or frequency to time.\nThis relationship is incredibly useful in practice, especially in physics and engineering, where differentiation often pops up in systems and signals.\n\nAnd best of all, it’s not magic — you can prove this directly from the Fourier transform formula, just by carefully taking the derivative under the integral.\nSo this derivative property really adds to our collection of powerful tools in the Fourier toolbox.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
