From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow that we understand the Fourier transform in one dimension, let’s take it a step further — to two dimensions.\n\nJust like in the 1D case, the idea is to take a function — in this case, a function of two variables, x and y — and express it in terms of its frequency content. But instead of waves traveling along a line, now we’re dealing with wave patterns that extend in all directions across a plane.\n\nThe 2D Fourier transform lets us analyze how these wave components — traveling in the x direction, the y direction, or even diagonally — contribute to the overall structure of the signal or image.\nThe formula here tells us how to compute the 2D Fourier transform. The function f of x and y is transformed into capital F of u and v, where u and v represent the spatial frequencies in the horizontal and vertical directions.\nAnd just like before, there’s an inverse formula that lets us go back from the frequency domain to the original spatial domain.\nNow, why is this so useful?\n\nBecause in many real-world applications — like medical imaging, computer vision, or signal processing — we deal with 2D data. Think of an image, for example. Each pixel represents a value at some x and y location. When we apply the 2D Fourier transform, we can analyze the texture, orientation, and frequency content of that image.\n\nOn the left side of the slide, we see a simple geometric object — like a bar. On the right is its 2D Fourier spectrum. Notice how the orientation of the object affects the direction of the frequency response.\nSo just like in one dimension, we’re decomposing a complex signal into simpler, sinusoidal components — but now in two dimensions. And that opens up a whole new world of possibilities.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
