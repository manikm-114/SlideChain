From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nWelcome back, everyone.\n\nToday, we move one step further in our journey — from the Fourier series to the Fourier transform. This is a big transition, and it’s a powerful one. So, what exactly changes when we move from a series to a transform? That’s what we’ll uncover together in this lecture.\n\nBefore we begin, I want to emphasize something important. You need to have a solid understanding of the Fourier series first. The transform builds directly on those ideas. If you’re still feeling confused about Fourier series — don’t worry — but do take action. You can interact with ChatGPT, discuss with your classmates, review the lecture materials, and review the chapter I wrote. You can also search online for different explanations or examples that make more sense to you. Group discussions can be constructive.\n\nFourier analysis is fundamental — not just for this course, but for understanding medical imaging technologies down the line. I want to make sure no one gets left behind here. Because if you miss this foundation, the rest of the material will feel considerably harder.\nAlright — let’s dive in.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Reject filler or administrative text.\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"Fourier series\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"Fourier transform\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"Fourier analysis\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"medical imaging technologies\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"Fourier series foundation\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"Fourier transform foundation\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"Fourier analysis foundation\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"Fourier series understanding\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"Fourier transform understanding\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"Fourier analysis understanding\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"Fourier series and transform\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"Fourier series to transform\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"Fourier series to transform transition\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"Fourier series to transform big transition\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"Fourier series",
