From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo now, let’s bring this scaling idea to life with a visual example.\n\nTake a look at the top plot. This shows different versions of a triangular function — blue, orange, and green. They all have the same shape, but different widths.\nThe blue triangle is the narrowest.\u000bThe orange one is a little wider.\u000bAnd the green one is the widest of all.\nNow, let’s look at what happens in the frequency domain — shown in the bottom plot.\n\nHere’s the key idea:\u000bWhen the function gets wider in time, its frequency content gets narrower.\nYou can see that clearly:\nThe narrow blue triangle has the widest Fourier transform — that’s the blue curve in the bottom plot.\nThe medium-width orange triangle gives a more focused frequency response — that’s the orange curve.\nAnd the wide green triangle gives a sharp, tall peak in the frequency domain — the green curve below.\nThis is the heart of the scaling property.\u000bWider in time means tighter in frequency, and vice versa.\n\nIt’s a kind of duality — as if time and frequency are pulling on opposite ends of a rope.\nAnd as a special case, if you use a delta function — which is infinitely narrow in time — its Fourier transform becomes perfectly flat, spread across all frequencies.\nOn the other hand, a Gaussian function is balanced — it’s the only shape where both the time and frequency profiles remain Gaussian.\nSo visually, scaling is not just a math trick — it’s a powerful way to understand how functions behave in both domains.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
