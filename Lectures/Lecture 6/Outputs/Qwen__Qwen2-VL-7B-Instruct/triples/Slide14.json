Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s bring things down to earth a bit and look at a concrete example — something visual, something simple.\nThis function right here is called the rectangular function, or sometimes the gate function. You’ll also see it written as pi of t.\nAnd as you can see from the graph — it really does look like a gate.\n\nLet’s break it down:\nThe value of the function is 1 when the absolute value of t is less than one-half — that is, between minus one-half and plus one-half.\nOutside that interval, the function drops to zero.\nSo, the entire “on” region is one unit wide, and the height is 1, which means the area under the curve is also 1.\nThis function is simple, but it’s also very important — and we’re going to use it often in later examples.\n\nNow here’s the key point:\u000bThis is a non-periodic function.\nAnd back when we only had Fourier series — which apply to periodic functions — we couldn’t directly express this kind of shape using sines and cosines.\nBut now, thanks to the Fourier transform, we can.\n\nWe’re no longer limited to repeating signals. We can now handle functions like this — compact, finite, non-repeating — and still express them in terms of sinusoidal components, just over a continuous range of frequencies.\nSo this rectangular function — although it’s simple — gives us a great opportunity to visualize the power of the Fourier transform.\nLet’s keep going and see what it looks like in the frequency domain.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
