Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAlright, to wrap up today’s session, here’s your homework assignment.\n\nFirst, I’d like you to read about the uncertainty principle of the Fourier transform. This is a fascinating and important concept. Summarize it in your own words, but keep it concise — no more than three sentences.\n\nSecond, I want you to analytically compute the Fourier transform of this function: the exponential of b times t, multiplied by the step function u of negative t. Here, b is a positive constant, and u of t is defined as 1 for positive time and 0 otherwise.\nThe due date is one week from now, by midnight next Friday. Please make sure to upload your report to MLS.\n\nAnd before we end, I’ve heard from a few students that the Fourier series material was a bit confusing. If that’s you, don’t hesitate — come talk to me now or reach out later. I’m happy to help clarify anything.\nThat’s all for today — thank you!\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}",
