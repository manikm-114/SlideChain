Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo far, we’ve been working under a simple assumption — that the function we’re analyzing has a unit period. That means the function repeats every one unit of time, say, from 0 to 1.\n\nBut what if the period is something else — like 5, or 100? That’s what we’re covering here.\nThis slide shows how to handle a function with an arbitrary period, which we’ll call capital T. The good news is: the concept stays exactly the same — we’re still breaking the function into complex exponential components — but we just adjust the formulas a bit.\n\nHere’s how the function f of t is now written:\nf of t equals the sum from n equals minus infinity to infinity of c n times e to the power i 2 pi n t over T.\nSo you can think of this as a generalized version of the complex Fourier series.\n\nAnd to compute the coefficient c n, we use the formula:\nc n equals 1 over capital T, times the integral from minus T over 2 to T over 2 of e to the power minus i 2 pi n t over T, which is multiplied by f of t, with respect to t.\n\nNow let me break that down for you:\nThe exponential term — that’s your harmonic basis function, adjusted for the new period.\nt over T is just a way to normalize time, so that we’re still operating over a standard interval.\nThe 1 over T in front is a scaling factor that makes everything work out correctly.\nAnd the range of integration — from minus T over 2 to plus T over 2 — gives us a symmetric interval, which is often more convenient for analysis.\n\nSo, whether your period is 1, 10, or any other positive number, you simply use T in place of 1 and apply this formula. You’re still summing wave-like components — just stretched or compressed in time depending on the period.\nNow here’s something helpful:\u000bIf you set T equals 1, this formula reduces back to the unit-period version we saw before. So you only need to remember this general form — and adjust T as needed.\n\nIn practice, the real form of the Fourier series is nice because it gives you a clear geometric picture — sines, cosines, and their amplitudes.\u000bThe complex form, like the one we see here, is more compact and elegant, especially when we move into transforms. It just takes a little abstract thinking in complex space.\nSo this wraps up our review of Fourier series — both real and complex — and now we’re ready to move on to the Fourier transform itself.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
