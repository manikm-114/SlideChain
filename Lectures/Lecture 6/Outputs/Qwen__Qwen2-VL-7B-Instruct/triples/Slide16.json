Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, let’s visualize the powerful idea we’ve been building toward — how we move from Fourier series to the Fourier transform.\nWhat you see here is the frequency-domain representation of the rectangular function as we increase the period of its periodic extension.\nLet’s start at the top left.\nThese vertical lines represent the Fourier coefficients — discrete spikes at different frequency points. These are the outputs of the Fourier series.\u000b\nYou’ve got:\nA DC component at zero frequency,\nThe first harmonic,\nThe second harmonic, and so on.\nEach coefficient is calculated using the formulas we saw earlier. And because the original function is real-valued, these coefficients appear symmetrically around zero when using the complex form.\n\nNow — here’s the trick:\u000bWe begin to increase the period T of the function.\nThat means we’re spacing the rectangular pulses farther apart in the time domain. And in the frequency domain, this has a very important effect:\u000bThe spacing between the Fourier components, which is 1 over T, becomes smaller and smaller.\nYou can see this happening in the middle image — the spikes begin to cluster more tightly. The frequency axis, labeled u equals n divided by T, gets more densely sampled.\nAnd as we continue increasing T — moving to the bottom image — the spacing becomes infinitesimally small. At this point, we’re no longer looking at a discrete spectrum. We now have a continuous curve.\nThat’s the moment when we’ve transitioned from the Fourier series to the Fourier transform.\n\nSo here’s the big picture:\nWhen a function is periodic, we get a discrete Fourier spectrum.\nBut when the function becomes non-periodic, by letting the period go to infinity, we end up with a continuous Fourier spectrum.\nThis spectrum is smooth and continuous — and it tells us how much of each frequency exists in the original signal.\nSo this slide gives us the geometrical insight — the visual transition — from the world of periodic signals and discrete spectra, to the world of non-periodic signals and continuous spectra.\nAnd this is what the Fourier transform captures so beautifully.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
