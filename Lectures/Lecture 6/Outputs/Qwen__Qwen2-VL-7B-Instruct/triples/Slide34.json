Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo far, we’ve been talking about transformations in one dimension — mainly between time and frequency using the Fourier transform. But to truly understand what's going on, it helps to think geometrically.\nLet’s start with something more familiar — a simple two-dimensional rotation.\n\nImagine we have a point in the 2D plane, described by coordinates x and y in a standard X Y coordinate system. Now, suppose we want to express this same point in a new coordinate system, X-prime and Y-prime, which is rotated by some angle phi from the original axes.\nAs the diagram shows, the new coordinates — x-prime and y-prime — can be computed from the original ones using the rotation formulas.\n\nSo x-prime equals x times cosine phi plus y times sine phi,\u000band y-prime equals negative x times sine phi plus y times cosine phi.\nYou can also write this transformation in matrix form. It’s a simple 2-by-2 rotation matrix.\nNow why is this relevant?\n\nBecause this kind of rotation is a basic example of an orthonormal transformation, just like the Fourier transform. When we rotate the coordinate system, we’re not changing the length of the vector — we’re just viewing it from a different angle. The structure stays the same, just expressed differently.\n\nThis gives us a visual and intuitive way to think about more abstract transformations. In higher dimensions — or even infinite dimensions — the concept is similar. We’re taking a function, representing it in a new coordinate system, and the transformation preserves important properties like length and energy.\n\nThat’s why understanding this simple 2D rotation helps us better appreciate what the Fourier transform is doing. It’s not magic — it’s geometry, just in a much bigger space.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
