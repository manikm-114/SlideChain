Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s take a moment to understand why the convolution theorem actually works. What’s the reasoning behind it?\nSo far, we've seen that the Fourier transform of the convolution of two functions — say, f of t and g of t — turns into a simple multiplication of their individual transforms. \n\nBut why is that true?\nLet’s walk through the logic behind it, one step at a time.\nWe start with this:\u000bMultiply the Fourier transform of f of t by the Fourier transform of g of t. That means you're multiplying two integrals. One for g of t times a complex exponential, and the other for f of x times the same kind of exponential — but with a different variable.\nTo combine them, we use different dummy variables inside the integrals — like t in one and x in the other — so they don't interfere. Then we combine them into a double integral.\n\nNow we group the exponential terms. The two exponentials become a single exponential with t plus x in the exponent.\nThis sets up our key trick: we change variables. In the inner integral, let’s say\u000bu equals t plus x. That means t equals u minus x, and since we're just changing variables inside an integral, the limits stay the same.\nSo now, what used to be g of t becomes g of u minus x, and the exponential becomes a function of u. This lets us express the entire inside of the integral in terms of u, and f of x stays outside.\nAt this point, we switch the order of integration — that’s allowed because the functions we’re working with are well-behaved. So now we’re integrating over u, with x nested inside.\n\nWhat you get in the end is this:\u000bYou have e to the power minus 2 pi i s  u — that’s the same complex exponential from the Fourier formula — and it’s multiplied by the convolution of g and f at position u.\nThat’s the key. The inner integral has now become the convolution of g and f, evaluated at u.\nSo finally, this whole thing is just the Fourier transform of that convolution.\nThat’s the magic of it.\u000b\nMultiplication in the Fourier domain really does correspond to convolution in the time domain — and now you’ve seen where it comes from.\nOf course, these steps are dense, and I encourage you to go over them again slowly. Grab a coffee, sit back, and follow the substitutions. Each step follows cleanly from the last — and the full picture is quite elegant.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
