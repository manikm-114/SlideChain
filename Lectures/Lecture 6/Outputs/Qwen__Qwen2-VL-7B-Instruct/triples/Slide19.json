Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s take a look at the actual shape of the sinc function — the one we just derived from the rectangular gate.\n\nWhat you see here is the graph of that function — sinc of u — which is defined as sine of pi times u, divided by pi times u.\nIt has a smooth, wave-like shape. The peak is right at the center — at u equals zero — and the height there is exactly 1.\nAs you move away from the center in either direction, the function oscillates — it goes up and down — but the peaks get smaller and smaller.\nThat’s because the sine wave in the numerator keeps swinging, but the denominator grows, so the overall value shrinks.\nThis is the signature look of the sinc function — one strong central lobe and then smaller and smaller ripples on the sides.\n\nSo this is the frequency domain representation of a simple gate in time.\nAnd just to recap — this sinc function came from a rectangular gate function of width 1.\nIf we use a wider gate — let’s say the width is capital T instead of 1 — then the sinc function would stretch out horizontally. That is, the ripples would become narrower in frequency, because time and frequency are inversely related.\n\nWe’ll explore that in more detail when we talk about the scaling property. But for now, just remember: a narrow gate in time gives a wide sinc in frequency. A wide gate in time gives a narrow sinc.\nThis is a key idea we’ll return to again and again.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
