Now let’s bring things down to earth a bit and look at a concrete example — something visual, something simple.
This function right here is called the rectangular function, or sometimes the gate function. You’ll also see it written as pi of t.
And as you can see from the graph — it really does look like a gate.

Let’s break it down:
The value of the function is 1 when the absolute value of t is less than one-half — that is, between minus one-half and plus one-half.
Outside that interval, the function drops to zero.
So, the entire “on” region is one unit wide, and the height is 1, which means the area under the curve is also 1.
This function is simple, but it’s also very important — and we’re going to use it often in later examples.

Now here’s the key point:This is a non-periodic function.
And back when we only had Fourier series — which apply to periodic functions — we couldn’t directly express this kind of shape using sines and cosines.
But now, thanks to the Fourier transform, we can.

We’re no longer limited to repeating signals. We can now handle functions like this — compact, finite, non-repeating — and still express them in terms of sinusoidal components, just over a continuous range of frequencies.
So this rectangular function — although it’s simple — gives us a great opportunity to visualize the power of the Fourier transform.
Let’s keep going and see what it looks like in the frequency domain.
