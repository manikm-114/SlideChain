Let's look into more detail. Okay, the first linearity. So this is just, again, this part copied from the Stanford textbook. So you have a function f and g. 

There are Fourier transformations. So you have Fourier transformation. You have this summation, the summation of the original function. 
Then you perform Fourier transformation. The result is the same as the summation of the Fourier transformation of f and the Fourier transformation of g. So this is additivity. So in the system, linear system lecture, we explain that. 

How about the scaling or homogeneity? So if f is scaled by alpha, then we perform Fourier transform. That's the same as performing the Fourier transform of f. Then you scale the result by the same scaling factor. So you can verify these two properties according to the formula by defining the Fourier transform. So you can just see here, just as an example, you show additivity. And you can similarly show the scaling property.
