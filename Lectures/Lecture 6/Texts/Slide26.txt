Let’s take a closer look at the scaling property of the Fourier transform.
Here’s the idea. Suppose we have a function, f of t. And now, instead of f of t, we look at f of a times t, where a is just some constant — not zero.

We’re changing the time scale. The question is: what happens to its Fourier transform?
Well, this depends on whether a is positive or negative. But in both cases, something interesting happens.
First, let’s say a is greater than zero.
We plug f of a t into the Fourier transform formula. If you do the math — which involves changing variables and rearranging terms — you end up with this:
The Fourier transform of f of a t becomesone divided by a, times F of s divided by a.

So what does that mean?
If we stretch the function in time — that is, make it slower — its frequency content gets compressed.And if we squeeze it in time — make it faster — the frequency content stretches out.

Now, what if a is less than zero?
In that case, the same formula still works, but with a minus sign that comes from flipping the limits of integration.

So we just take the absolute value of a, and the final result becomes:
The Fourier transform of f of a t equalsone over the absolute value of a, times F of s over a.

So in short:Scaling in time causes the opposite effect in frequency.That’s the scaling property.
And this is one more way to see how time and frequency are tightly connected in the Fourier world.
