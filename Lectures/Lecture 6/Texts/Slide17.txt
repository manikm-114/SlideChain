Now that we’ve built up all the ideas step by step, let’s bring it all together into one elegant concept — the Fourier transform pair.
What you see on this slide captures the very heart of Fourier analysis.

Let’s begin with the first equation, which is the forward Fourier transform.Suppose you have a signal in the time domain, which we’ll call f of t. The goal is to understand how much of each frequency is present in that signal.

So how do we do that?
We project f of t onto a family of complex exponential functions. These functions look like e to the power minus i, 2 pi, u, t, where u is the frequency. This projection acts like an inner product, telling us how strongly f of t resonates with each frequency component.
When we integrate this product across all time, we obtain f hat of u, also called the frequency spectrum or the Fourier transform of f of t.
So this first equation maps the signal from the time domain to the frequency domain.

Now look at the second equation. This is the inverse Fourier transform.
Here, we take all those frequency components — that is, each f hat of u — and multiply them by their corresponding complex exponential, this time e to the power i, two pi, u, t. Then, we integrate over all frequencies.
And what do we get?We reconstruct the original signal — f of t — exactly.
So in summary, the forward transform takes you from time to frequency, and the inverse transform brings you back from frequency to time.That’s the two-way mapping shown symbolically at the bottom:f of t goes to f hat of u, and back again.

Now, a few mathematical notes to make this complete:
First — this transform assumes that f of t is square-integrable, meaning if you square the function and integrate it over all time, the total is finite. This ensures convergence and makes the math work properly.

Second — even though we’re dealing with a non-periodic function here, the idea still grows out of the Fourier series. Remember what happens when the period of a function becomes very large — the discrete set of frequency components becomes a continuous spectrum. The Fourier transform is essentially the limit of the Fourier series as the period tends to infinity.
And finally — here’s a nice geometric interpretation.
Think of projecting a 3D vector onto the x, y, and z axes.
In the same way, when we apply the Fourier transform, we’re projecting our function onto an infinite set of sine and cosine waves — or more precisely, complex exponentials. Each frequency contributes a tiny slice of the original signal.And by adding all those slices back together — using integration — we reconstruct the full signal.

This isn’t just a clever trick.It’s one of the most powerful tools in all of engineering, physics, and mathematics.It lets us analyze and manipulate signals in both time and frequency — without losing any information.
With this foundational concept in place, we’re ready to explore some practical examples and dive deeper into the properties of the Fourier transform.
