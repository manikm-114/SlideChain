Let me now give you a more intuitive, geometric explanation for the rotation property of the Fourier transform.
Suppose you have a 2D function — like the white rectangular bar you see on the top-left image. This function has a certain frequency structure, and that’s captured in its Fourier transform, shown to the right.

Now, here’s the key idea: each point in the Fourier spectrum corresponds to a sinusoidal wave component — a wave moving in a specific direction and with a certain frequency. When you sum up all these wave components, you reconstruct the original image.

So what happens when we rotate the original function? Say we rotate it 45 degrees counterclockwise. Well, to reconstruct this rotated function using the same wave-based approach, each of those original wave components must also rotate by the same 45 degrees. That’s the only way they’ll still combine to match the rotated shape.

As you can see in the second row, the rotated spatial function leads to a rotated frequency spectrum. Both are rotated by the same angle, preserving the overall structure. This is what we mean by the rotation property of the Fourier transform.
You can verify this rigorously with mathematics, but this geometric reasoning gives us an intuitive, visual understanding of what’s happening.

This is part of a much deeper concept: the duality of information. You can think of an image as made of individual points — pixels or voxels — or as made of sinusoids, each with different directions and frequencies. These two views are completely interchangeable, and Fourier analysis is the bridge between them.

That’s why this topic is so foundational. It’s not just about imaging. Fourier analysis underlies many areas — in physics, engineering, and even mathematics — wherever we want to understand structure in terms of frequency.
Now let’s take a moment to summarize what we’ve learned so far.
