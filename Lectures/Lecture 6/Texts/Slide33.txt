Now let’s talk about another important result in Fourier analysis — Parseval’s Identity.

This identity says that the total energy of a signal, when measured in the time domain, is exactly equal to the total energy in the frequency domain. Mathematically, it's written as:the integral of the square of the function f of t over all time, equals the integral of the square of its Fourier transform — f hat of s — over all frequencies.
Let me give you some intuition here.

Suppose you have a function, maybe it’s an electric signal or a sound wave. In the time domain, the quantity f of t squared represents the power of that signal at each instant. When you integrate this over time, you’re summing up all that power — you get the total energy.
Now, that same signal can be broken down into its frequency components using the Fourier transform. In that domain, each component has an amplitude, and squaring that amplitude gives you the energy associated with that frequency. Integrating over all frequencies gives you the total energy — again.

So Parseval’s Identity tells us something very beautiful: energy is conserved between the time domain and the frequency domain.
This has a strong connection to what you learned in physics. Think about alternating current. If you have a sinusoidal current flowing through a resistor, the instantaneous power is proportional to the current squared. And when you integrate that over time, you get the total energy consumed by the resistor.

Now, from a geometric perspective, you can think of f of t as a vector in an infinite-dimensional space. That sounds abstract, but it’s just like a regular vector — except with infinitely many components. And the length of this vector is found by summing up the square of each component — just like in ordinary geometry.

The Fourier transform is a kind of coordinate transformation — like a rotation of the space. So when we go from the time domain to the frequency domain, we’re rotating the vector. But that doesn’t change its length. So geometrically, Parseval’s Identity simply says: the length of the signal vector is preserved under the Fourier transform.
You can also prove this identity using standard calculus and the definition of the Fourier transform. And yes, that’s a good exercise. But I want you to also grasp the meaning behind it.

So next time you see this identity, remember — it’s not just a formula. It tells you that energy, or vector length, is preserved when moving between the time and frequency domains. And that is both physically and mathematically very powerful.
