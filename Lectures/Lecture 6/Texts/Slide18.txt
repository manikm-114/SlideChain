Let’s go through a concrete example — the Fourier transform of the gate function, also called the rectangular function.
We’ve already seen this function earlier. It’s a flat function that equals 1 when the time variable t is between minus one-half and plus one-half, and it’s zero everywhere else. So it looks like a rectangle centered at zero.

Now, we want to find its Fourier transform. To do that, we apply the definition.
We take the integral of the original function multiplied by a complex exponential — that’s e to the power negative i 2 pi u t — and we integrate over all time.

But since the gate function is zero outside the interval from minus one-half to plus one-half, we only need to integrate over that range.
So the integral becomes: from minus one-half to plus one-half of e to the negative i 2 pi u t, with respect to t.
This is a standard exponential integral. When you solve it, you get the function sine of pi u, divided by pi u.
This result is known as the sinc function and it shows up everywhere in signal processing and imaging.
So here’s what we’ve found: a rectangle in time turns into a sinc wave in frequency. That’s a beautiful and very useful result.

Now, what if we stretch the gate to make it wider?
Let’s say the gate equals 1 from minus capital T over 2 to plus T over 2, and zero elsewhere. Then the Fourier transform becomes a scaled version of the same sinc function — it just shrinks or stretches based on the value of T.
So you could try computing it directly, or you could use a shortcut — the scaling property of the Fourier transform, which we’ll talk about soon.

But the key point is this: the rectangular function in time gives us a sinc function in frequency.
And here’s one final note. You might wonder what happens when u equals zero, because both the top and bottom become zero. But don’t worry — if you take the limit using calculus, it turns out the value is exactly 1. So the function is smooth at the center.
We’ll use this gate-to-sinc pair often, so keep it in mind as we move forward.
