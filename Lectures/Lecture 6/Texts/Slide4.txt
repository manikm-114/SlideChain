Now let’s look at the same function from a completely different angle — instead of seeing it as a sum of impulses, imagine it as a sum of waves.

Here, we’re working with a periodic function — meaning it repeats itself over time. Let’s just focus on one complete cycle of that function. The rest are just copies.
The key idea is this: a periodic function like this can be broken down into many sine and cosine waves — we call these sinusoidal components. These waves can vary in three ways: their frequency, which tells us how fast they oscillate; their amplitude, which tells us how tall they are; and their phase, which tells us where each wave starts.

So what’s the trick? We want to find the right combination of amplitudes, frequencies, and phases — so that when we add up all these sine and cosine waves, we recover the original function.
At first, this might sound abstract, but conceptually it’s not that difficult. You’re just looking at the same function in a different way.
Earlier, we saw a kind of particle view — slicing the function into sharp impulses. Now we’re seeing a wave view — smoothing it into oscillating signals.
And this wave-based view is the foundation for Fourier analysis.
