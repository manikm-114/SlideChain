Now, let’s visualize the powerful idea we’ve been building toward — how we move from Fourier series to the Fourier transform.
What you see here is the frequency-domain representation of the rectangular function as we increase the period of its periodic extension.
Let’s start at the top left.
These vertical lines represent the Fourier coefficients — discrete spikes at different frequency points. These are the outputs of the Fourier series.
You’ve got:
A DC component at zero frequency,
The first harmonic,
The second harmonic, and so on.
Each coefficient is calculated using the formulas we saw earlier. And because the original function is real-valued, these coefficients appear symmetrically around zero when using the complex form.

Now — here’s the trick:We begin to increase the period T of the function.
That means we’re spacing the rectangular pulses farther apart in the time domain. And in the frequency domain, this has a very important effect:The spacing between the Fourier components, which is 1 over T, becomes smaller and smaller.
You can see this happening in the middle image — the spikes begin to cluster more tightly. The frequency axis, labeled u equals n divided by T, gets more densely sampled.
And as we continue increasing T — moving to the bottom image — the spacing becomes infinitesimally small. At this point, we’re no longer looking at a discrete spectrum. We now have a continuous curve.
That’s the moment when we’ve transitioned from the Fourier series to the Fourier transform.

So here’s the big picture:
When a function is periodic, we get a discrete Fourier spectrum.
But when the function becomes non-periodic, by letting the period go to infinity, we end up with a continuous Fourier spectrum.
This spectrum is smooth and continuous — and it tells us how much of each frequency exists in the original signal.
So this slide gives us the geometrical insight — the visual transition — from the world of periodic signals and discrete spectra, to the world of non-periodic signals and continuous spectra.
And this is what the Fourier transform captures so beautifully.
