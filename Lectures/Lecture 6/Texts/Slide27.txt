So now, let’s bring this scaling idea to life with a visual example.

Take a look at the top plot. This shows different versions of a triangular function — blue, orange, and green. They all have the same shape, but different widths.
The blue triangle is the narrowest.The orange one is a little wider.And the green one is the widest of all.
Now, let’s look at what happens in the frequency domain — shown in the bottom plot.

Here’s the key idea:When the function gets wider in time, its frequency content gets narrower.
You can see that clearly:
The narrow blue triangle has the widest Fourier transform — that’s the blue curve in the bottom plot.
The medium-width orange triangle gives a more focused frequency response — that’s the orange curve.
And the wide green triangle gives a sharp, tall peak in the frequency domain — the green curve below.
This is the heart of the scaling property.Wider in time means tighter in frequency, and vice versa.

It’s a kind of duality — as if time and frequency are pulling on opposite ends of a rope.
And as a special case, if you use a delta function — which is infinitely narrow in time — its Fourier transform becomes perfectly flat, spread across all frequencies.
On the other hand, a Gaussian function is balanced — it’s the only shape where both the time and frequency profiles remain Gaussian.
So visually, scaling is not just a math trick — it’s a powerful way to understand how functions behave in both domains.
