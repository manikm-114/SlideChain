Alright, to wrap up today’s session, here’s your homework assignment.

First, I’d like you to read about the uncertainty principle of the Fourier transform. This is a fascinating and important concept. Summarize it in your own words, but keep it concise — no more than three sentences.

Second, I want you to analytically compute the Fourier transform of this function: the exponential of b times t, multiplied by the step function u of negative t. Here, b is a positive constant, and u of t is defined as 1 for positive time and 0 otherwise.
The due date is one week from now, by midnight next Friday. Please make sure to upload your report to MLS.

And before we end, I’ve heard from a few students that the Fourier series material was a bit confusing. If that’s you, don’t hesitate — come talk to me now or reach out later. I’m happy to help clarify anything.
That’s all for today — thank you!
