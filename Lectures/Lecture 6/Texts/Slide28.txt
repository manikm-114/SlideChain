Now let’s talk about a beautiful and surprising property of the Fourier transform — its connection to derivatives.
Suppose we start with a function, f of t, and its Fourier transform is capital F of s.

Now you might ask:What happens if we take the derivative of f — that is, f prime of t — and then perform the Fourier transform?
The answer is elegant:Taking a derivative in time becomes multiplication in the frequency domain.

More precisely,The Fourier transform of f ' of t is just 2 pi i s times the Fourier transform of f.So again, taking a derivative becomes a simple multiplication — and the factor depends on frequency.
There’s also a second version of this rule:If you take the derivative of the Fourier transform itself with respect to s,That’s the same as applying -2 pi i t to f of t — and then transforming it.

So in summary:
Derivatives in one domain correspond to multiplications in the other domain.
And this duality works both ways — from time to frequency, or frequency to time.
This relationship is incredibly useful in practice, especially in physics and engineering, where differentiation often pops up in systems and signals.

And best of all, it’s not magic — you can prove this directly from the Fourier transform formula, just by carefully taking the derivative under the integral.
So this derivative property really adds to our collection of powerful tools in the Fourier toolbox.
