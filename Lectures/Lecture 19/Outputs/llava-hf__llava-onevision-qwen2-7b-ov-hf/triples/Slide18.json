Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow here comes the great idea — introducing a gradient field on top of the background field B-naught. This was such an important idea that it led to a Nobel Prize.\nSo why is this so important? Because this is the key step that allows us to encode spatial information.\n\nIn the main field B-naught, the processional frequency of all spins would be the same. That would not allow us to distinguish one location from another.\nBut if we apply a gradient field, we change the situation. The magnetic field strength will now depend on position. For example, the larger the z-coordinate, the stronger the field. As a result, the processional frequency will also depend on position.\n\nSo now, instead of all spins having the same frequency, their frequency varies with location. At z equals zero, the frequency is the original B-naught frequency. But away from zero, it becomes stronger or weaker depending on the gradient.\nThis is the concept of a field gradient.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
