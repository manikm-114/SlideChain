  "raw_output": "user \nSystem:\nYou are extracting factual relations from a medical imaging lecture. Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo now we come to the final part of this lecture. You see, we have obtained cross-sectional images using MRI. The last slides summarize the key points and also point to the MRI scanners themselves. I will not go into the engineering details of scanners here, since these are mostly descriptive and you can easily read them from the textbook. \n\nThe textbook straightforwardly explains the scanner components. If you read carefully, you will find it both easy and interesting to understand. You will also find additional material about spin echo sequences, gradient echo, and slice selection, which can deepen your understanding. These are not required for the core lecture, but they are excellent supplemental resources if you want to learn more. And finally, you will have some homework related to this lecture, so that you can review the key ideas and practice the concepts we discussed.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"cross-sectional images\", \"p\":\"produces\",\n     \"o\":\"MRI\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"The last slides summarize the key points and also point to the MRI scanners themselves.\"}\n  ]\n}",
