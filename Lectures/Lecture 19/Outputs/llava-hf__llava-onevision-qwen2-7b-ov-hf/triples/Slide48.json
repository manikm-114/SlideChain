Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThis 3D rendering gives us a cutaway view of how an MRI scanner is structured and how a patient fits inside the system. At the center, you see the patient lying on the patient table, which slides into the bore of the scanner. Surrounding the patient are several key components. Closest to the body are the radio frequency coils. These coils are responsible for transmitting the RF pulses that flip the spins inside the tissue, and also for receiving the weak signals emitted back from the patient. Without these coils, no imaging would be possible.\n\nJust outside the RF coils are the gradient coils. These coils are used to create small, linearly varying magnetic fields on top of the main magnetic field. By turning the gradient coils on and off in different directions, the scanner performs slice selection, phase encoding, and frequency encoding, which are the core steps that allow spatial localization of the MRI signal.\n\nEncasing the gradient coils is the large superconducting magnet, shown here as the main cylindrical structure of the scanner. This magnet produces the strong, uniform field we call B-zero, typically one and a half Tesla, three Tesla, or even higher in advanced systems. The magnet is what aligns the spins in the body, creating the initial conditions necessary for MRI.\n\nAll of this hardware is integrated into the scanner body, which you see as the outer blue casing. The patient is positioned on the table and moved smoothly into the bore for imaging. This design allows precise alignment of the body part of interest with the center of the magnet, where the field is most uniform.\nSo in summary, this diagram shows the layered structure of an MRI scanner: the patient table for positioning, the RF coils for transmit and receive, the gradient coils for spatial encoding, and the large magnet that provides the powerful, stable field at the heart of the system.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
