Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere we see a PET-MRI scanner, which is an advanced hybrid imaging system. On the left side of the slide, there is a schematic diagram showing how the different components are arranged, and on the right side, you see an actual Siemens PET-MRI machine.\n\nThe MRI part of the scanner is built around the large cylindrical magnet, just like a conventional MRI. The magnet shielding coil, the primary magnet coil, and the gradient coils are all stacked concentrically, forming the core structure of the system. These generate the strong static field and the spatially varying gradient fields needed for magnetic resonance imaging. Inside this same system, PET detector modules are integrated. These include layers such as the PET camera, avalanche photodiodes, LSO crystals, and associated electronics like pre-amplifiers and driver boards. Together, these PET modules detect the gamma rays emitted by radioactive tracers inside the patient’s body.\n\nAn RF head coil is also shown in the diagram, which is part of the MRI subsystem, used to transmit radiofrequency pulses and receive the MR signal. The magnet cryostat, shown as the outer casing, maintains the superconducting coils at very low temperatures so that the magnetic field stays stable.\nOn the right-hand side, the Siemens clinical PET-MRI scanner looks very much like a conventional MRI machine. But the key difference is that the PET detectors are integrated into the bore, allowing simultaneous acquisition of MRI data and PET data. This means that while MRI provides excellent soft-tissue contrast and anatomical detail, PET simultaneously provides functional and metabolic information. The result is a powerful hybrid modality that combines structural and functional imaging in a single scan.\n\nThis PET-MRI approach is especially important in neurology, oncology, and cardiology, where you want to see not just anatomy but also how tissues are functioning or metabolizing in real time.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
