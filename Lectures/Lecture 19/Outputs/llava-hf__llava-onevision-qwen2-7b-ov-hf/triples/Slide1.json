  "raw_output": "user \nSystem:\nYou are extracting factual relations from a medical imaging lecture. Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nIn this lecture, we move into the second part of MRI imaging. The first part, as you saw in the video, focused on the underlying physical principles. Now, we will explain how MRI imaging is performed, based on those physical models and principles.\n\nIt’s best to begin by reading the chapter first. You may naturally have questions, but that’s exactly why you attend this lecture. Without that preparation, it’s often difficult to build a solid understanding. MRI is quite tricky—you need to carefully think about the concepts, the relationships, and revisit them several times. Hence, an iterative approach should be used to preview, discuss, and review, again and again.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"Physical principles\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"The first part of the MRI imaging focused on the underlying physical principles.\"}\n  ]\n}",
