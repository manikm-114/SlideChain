Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo this spin echo sequence is a very clever design. And from it, we get two very important parameters.\n\nThe first one is the echo time, which we write as T-E. This is defined as the time from the ninety-degree pulse to the echo peak. In practice, you apply a ninety-degree pulse, then a one-hundred-eighty-degree pulse, and the time from the ninety-degree to the one-eighty is T-E divided by two. Then, after the one-eighty pulse, you wait another T-E divided by two, and that’s when the spin echo appears.\nThe spin echo amplitude reflects the decay due to pure T-two, independent of external field inhomogeneity. That’s the significance of T-E.\n\nThe second parameter is the repetition time, or T-R. After the first sequence, you can wait for a time T-R, and then repeat the same trick, ninety degrees, one-eighty degrees, another spin echo. But in order for the system to be in a stable state, T-R has to be long enough so that the magnetization vector M-naught has fully recovered.\n\nIf, for example, T-R is chosen as two thousand milliseconds, that may not be long enough for full recovery. In that case, the longitudinal magnetization is still less than the original M-naught, and the signal will be reduced.\nSo this is why T-E and T-R are significant. By definition, T-E should always be less than T-R.\n\nNow, this also connects to imaging. At the top, when we look at the spin echo for the whole sample, we get one signal that represents the entire patient or sample as a whole. But in imaging, we want more than that. We want to know the values of T-one and T-two for each pixel or voxel, not just the whole object. That requires us to encode spatial information. We’ll get into that starting with the next slide.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
