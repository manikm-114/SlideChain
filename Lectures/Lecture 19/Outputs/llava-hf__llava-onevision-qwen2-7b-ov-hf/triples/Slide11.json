Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, how do we measure T2? The most important and representative pulse sequence is the spin echo. Spin echo is a very clever design. It allows us to measure T2 directly. If you don’t use spin echo, the signal decay you observe will be governed by T2 star, which includes both biological effects and external field inhomogeneities. But what we want is the pure T2, which reflects tissue physiology and pathology.\n\nPure T2 is a biological effect, while T2 star is dominated by external field imperfections. Since your patient’s physiological status should not depend on imperfections in the external field, we really want to measure T2.\n\nSo how do we do it? Spin echo. First, you let the spins dephase for a short time. Then you apply a one-hundred-eighty-degree pulse. What happens? Some spins are lagging — they have a phase delay. Other spins are moving faster — they have an advanced phase. After the one-eighty-degree flip, the lagging spins continue to lag, and the faster spins continue to advance. But because their positions have been reversed by the flip, they will eventually meet again and refocus at a certain point.\n\nAt that refocusing point, the signal strength grows again, giving you the spin echo. This is a brilliant design. And in fact, you can repeat it multiple times for more echoes if you like.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
