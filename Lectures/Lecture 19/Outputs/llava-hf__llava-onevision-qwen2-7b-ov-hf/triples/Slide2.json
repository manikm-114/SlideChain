Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAgain, let us see where we are.  We started with medical physics—specifically MRI physics—in the first lecture. Now, we move to MR imaging. In our next lecture, we’ll talk about MRI pulse sequences, which will give us a more specific look at how MRI is applied in practice.\n\nHowever, today, our goal is to first revisit what we have learned so far.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1].
