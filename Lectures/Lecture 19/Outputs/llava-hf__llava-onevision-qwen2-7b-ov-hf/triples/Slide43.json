Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s consider the general case. Instead of just Gx, we allow general gradients along x, y, and z. These gradients can vary with time, and their effects accumulate as the spins process. The local precession frequency is determined by the inner product of the gradient vector G of t and the position vector r. When we integrate this over time, we get a phase factor that builds up gradually. This leads us to define k of t as gamma over 2 pi times the time integral of G of tau d tau. \n\nIn other words, k of t is a trajectory through Fourier space, controlled entirely by our choice of gradient waveforms. The measured signal s of t is then the Fourier transform of the object’s spin density, f of x, y, z, evaluated along this k-space trajectory. This is the k-space theorem. It tells us that by designing gradient waveforms, we can sample any path we want in k-space — straight lines, zig-zags, spirals, anything. That’s why MRI is so flexible. This general Fourier space formulation is extremely powerful because it connects what we measure directly to the spatial distribution of spins inside the patient. And again, by inverse Fourier transforming the collected data, we reconstruct the image.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
