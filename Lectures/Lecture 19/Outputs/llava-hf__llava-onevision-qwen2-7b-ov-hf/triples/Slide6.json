Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nWhenever you have a governing relationship like this, you can go through some mathematical steps.\n\nWith the first derivative like this, you just rearrange it a little bit. So you have:\u000b(one over y) d-y equals k d-t.\nThen, integrate both sides of the equation. On the left, you get ln absolute y, and on the right, you get k t plus C.\n\nNow, exponentiate both sides. That gives:\u000by equals A e to the k t, where A is a constant.\n\nThis shows that whenever the process is described by a first-order differential equation, the solution must be of this form: y is exponential growth or exponential decay. In other words, a constant multiplied by an exponential function, with index k t, where t is time.\n\nSo, this explains why you see exponential decay, exponential growth, or attenuation in earlier imaging modalities like X-ray imaging, and why you see the same behavior here in MRI.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"exponential function\", \"p\":\"represents\",\n     \"o\":\"exponential growth or exponential decay\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"In other words, a constant multiplied by an exponential function, with index k t, where t is time.\"}\n  ]\n}",
