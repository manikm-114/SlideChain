Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s revisit spin echo with another illustration. Spin echo is a very clever but also highly simplified signal model. In this figure, you can see the sequence step by step. You begin with the magnetization vector aligned along the z-axis. Then you apply a 90-degree pulse, which flips the vector into the transverse plane — here shown along the y-axis, though it could just as well be flipped along the x-axis depending on how the pulse is applied.\n\nOnce in the transverse plane, the spins begin to dephase because of local field inhomogeneities. Some spins process slightly faster, and others slightly slower. Over time, this produces a spread in phase, as shown here. Then comes the magic step: a 180-degree pulse is applied. This pulse flips the spins over, so that those that were lagging are now ahead, and those that were ahead are now behind. From that point forward, the phase differences begin to refocus. After the same amount of time has passed, the spins come back into alignment, forming an echo.\n\nThis is the echo signal that can be detected by the coil. Importantly, this echo arises from the selected slice, assuming you have already applied slice selection. The equation shown here, equation 4.43, expresses the signal mathematically as being proportional to the integral of the proton density over the slice. In other words, the echo represents the combined contribution of all the spins in that slice, after refocusing has occurred.\nSo spin echo illustrates in a very clear way how we can recover useful signal despite dephasing, and how gradients and RF pulses can be combined to control the evolution of magnetization in MRI.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
