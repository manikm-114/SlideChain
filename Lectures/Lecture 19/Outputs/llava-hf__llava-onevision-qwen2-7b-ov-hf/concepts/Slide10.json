From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThis really depends on tau, the delay time, before you apply the ninety-degree pulse. And this is illustrated here.\n\nLet’s review carefully. First, you apply a one-hundred-eighty-degree pulse, and the magnetization vector M-naught becomes minus M-naught. If you don’t do anything, this remains negative. Originally, you had a positive M-naught, but after the one-eighty pulse, it became negative M-naught. This negative magnetization will gradually recover back toward the original M-naught, returning to the normal, stable equilibrium. If you wait long enough, this negative value will rise, reach zero, and then continue climbing until it becomes fully positive again.\n\nSo it all depends on tau — the delay. At first, the amplitude is negative, then it grows smaller in magnitude, reaches zero, and then becomes positive, growing larger and larger toward M-naught. Now, if at some point during this recovery you apply a ninety-degree pulse, flipping it into the transverse plane — along the y-axis — you create a transverse component, and that can be measured. At this moment, you will have a signal.\n\nBut this signal is subject to T2 star decay, so what you measure is a free induction decay, or F-I-D signal. By repeating this process with different delay times, different values of tau, you can measure the signal amplitude as a function of tau-n. Then, you can plot this relationship. By arranging the equation properly, you get an exponential form with an index of minus tau-n divided by T1. If you take the logarithm, you can obtain a straight line. The slope of that line is minus one over T1, and from this slope, you can determine the T1 relaxation time.\n\nNow, be careful: if you directly take the log, you will not immediately get T1. You need to rearrange the equation. But one important point is that M-naught is known, because you can measure it directly. That’s why this works.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
