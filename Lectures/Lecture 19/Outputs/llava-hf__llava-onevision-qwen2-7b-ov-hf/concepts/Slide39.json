From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAnd you can use short TR or long TR. You can use short TE or long TE. And with different combinations, your image can reflect more about rho, about T1, or about T2. So with different combinations, you measure different parameters. This is not like CT, where you only measure the attenuation coefficient, mu. In MRI, you have T1, you have T2, and you have rho, the proton density. If you just do one measurement, one kind of image, then the image really reflects all of these parameters mixed together. But if you purposely want to emphasize one of the three parameters, you need to select the proper technical parameters.\n\nSo first, let me explain what I mean by long TR. TR is the time for repetition. If you wait long enough after each excitation, the m vector will return to the original position along the z-axis. So M0 aligns with the z-axis. That is what we mean by long TR. Long TR means the magnetization has had enough time to fully recover. Short TR means you do not give the system enough time, so the full value of M0 has not yet been recovered along the z-axis. That’s the meaning of long TR and short TR.\nNow let’s talk about TE, the echo time. What do we mean by short TE? Short TE means the echo time is very short. The spin echo is collected quickly, so the flipped M vector doesn’t have enough time to dephase. Because the echo is measured soon after flipping, the dephasing is not serious. So M xy, the transverse component after the 90-degree flip, has had very little time to dephase. That means there is no significant T2 effect. If you measure the signal with a short TE, you cannot tell how much T2 contributes, because T2 hasn’t had enough time to show its effect.\n\nNow, if you use a long TR, then the magnetization has fully recovered. That means you have no information about T1, because T1 does not play a role when you wait long enough. If you use short TR, the recovery along the z-axis is incomplete. In that case, the effect you observe depends on the degree of recovery of the longitudinal component, so you see the T1 effect. That’s why short TR with short TE is called T1-weighted imaging.\nNext, if you use long TE, the echo time is long enough for T2 decay to take effect. And if you also use long TR, so the longitudinal magnetization has fully recovered, then there is no T1 effect. In this case, the signal is dominated by T2 decay, so it is T2-weighted. That is shown here with the green arrow.\n\nNow, if you use long TR and short TE together, then there is no T1 effect, and no T2 effect. In that case, the signal is proportional to rho, the proton density, because you are basically measuring the full magnetization without either T1 or T2 altering it. That is called rho-weighted imaging.\nThere is also a combination shown here with short TR and long TE, but that is not possible in practice. Remember, TR is the repetition time, and TE is the echo time within that repetition. TE normally should not be longer than TR. So this case does not exist physically.\n\nSo, to summarize: short TR and short TE give you T1-weighted imaging, long TR and long TE give you T2-weighted imaging, and long TR with short TE gives you rho-weighted imaging. Again, this takes time for you to fully understand. And if this is your first time seeing it, it is natural to feel a little confused.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
