  "raw_output": "user \nSystem:\nYou are an expert educator in medical imaging. From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAt this point, you might be wondering — have you understood this, or are you confused? Honestly, if you have never studied this carefully before, it is very natural to be confused. Even for me, when I first studied this, I had to go through it several times, very carefully, before I felt I understood it clearly.\n\nSo let’s check ourselves. If you basically follow the logical flow so far, you can feel confident. If you are quite confused, that’s also expected — because these concepts are tricky and require repeated review. If you’re somewhere in between, that’s normal too. The important thing is not to get discouraged. What I will do now is go over the same ideas again, but from a slightly different angle, with more detail and more illustrations, so that the picture becomes clearer.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"confused\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"carefully\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"tricky\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"review\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"picture\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"different angle\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"more detail\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"more illustrations\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"clearer\", \"category\": \"software\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"If you are quite confused, that’s also expected — because these concepts are tricky and require repeated review.\", \"If you’re somewhere in between, that’s normal too.
