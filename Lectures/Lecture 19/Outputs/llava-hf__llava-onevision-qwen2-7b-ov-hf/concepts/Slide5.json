From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo, the change rate, whether it is growth or decay, is described by an ordinary first-order differential equation. The first derivative — the change rate — is proportional to the original quantity.\n\nWhen we talk about the change of y, the rate of change is proportional to y. You keep seeing this kind of first-order differential equation in multiple imaging modalities. For example, in X-ray imaging, you have the initial beam intensity. It will be attenuated. The amount of attenuation — the change of the X-ray flux — is proportional to the initial flux, which we call I-naught.\n\nSimilarly, here in MRI, with y, we are talking about the initial M vector, which is M-naught. So we have this relationship.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
