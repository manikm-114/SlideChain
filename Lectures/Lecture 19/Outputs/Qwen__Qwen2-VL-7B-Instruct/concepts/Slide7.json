From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, for T2, we need to look in more detail. T2 has two components, and it describes dephasing. The first dephasing is what we call the pure T2 effect, or spin–spin interaction. This happens because all the spinning protons are close to each other, and you do not have an absolutely uniform distribution. If you look microscopically, the spins interact with one another, and there are fluctuations in the local magnetic field. These effects are called pure T2, shown here in red, and they are due to spin–spin interaction. This behavior in soft tissue is physiological, and it cannot really be changed — it is a natural biological phenomenon.\n\nOn the other hand, when you place a patient, or even a small animal, in an external magnetic field — the B-naught field — we usually describe that field as uniform. But in reality, the B-naught field is never perfectly homogeneous. There will always be some inhomogeneity. This inhomogeneity is fixed: when you set up the B-naught field, some regions are slightly weaker, while other regions are slightly stronger. So, in one location, the spins process a little slower, and in another location, they process a little faster. That difference also contributes to dephasing.\n\nSo, both biological spin–spin interaction inside the tissue, and physical inhomogeneity of the external magnetic field, contribute to the same dephasing effect, but for different reasons. The external contribution is fixed and constant, while the biological part cannot really be corrected.\nWhen we combine these two, we call the result T2 star. The external field inhomogeneity alone is called T2 plus. So, in summary: T2 star is the combined effect of external field inhomogeneity and biological spin–spin interaction. And importantly, there is a reciprocal relationship between them.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
