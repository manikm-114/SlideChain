From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo at this point, I need to emphasize that this formulation is only approximate. Where exactly do the approximations come in? There are really three places. \n\nFirst, if you look at this expression, you see that the function depends on time, t. But when we talk about the k-space theorem, we treat it as if the whole function is fixed in space, something like F of x, y, z, and not time-varying. In reality, there is a time dependence here, and when we ignore that, we are making an approximation. \n\nSecond, you see this vector r, the positional vector. We treat it as if it is constant, fixed in space. But in reality, spins may move. For example, spins in blood keep moving. Patients may also move. Even molecular motion introduces some effects. But in this model, we ignore those motions and assume r is constant. That is another approximation. And third, the factor related to signal decay. \n\nIn practice, the signal we measure is subject to T2 star decay. But in this approximation, we assume that the readout is fast enough, so that no significant T2 star decay occurs during acquisition. That is a third approximation. Under these assumptions, the formulation reduces neatly to a Fourier transformation, which makes image reconstruction straightforward. But if you want very accurate imaging, all these neglected factors must be included. And once you include them, the reconstruction is no longer a simple Fourier transform. It becomes much more complex. \n\nIn fact, this is an area where machine learning and advanced reconstruction methods can play a big role. In the last part of the course, I will mention how modern approaches are being used to solve these challenges.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
