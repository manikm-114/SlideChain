From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nGraphically, we can show this as you see on the slide.\nThe gradient field creates a range of resonance frequencies along the z-axis. When you send an RF pulse with a defined frequency range, only the spins within that frequency range — and therefore within a specific z-range — are excited.\n\nThat z-range corresponds to the slice thickness. So this is how we select a slice in MRI.\nWhat we’ve explained here is the principle for slice selection along the z-axis.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
