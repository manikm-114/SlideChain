From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThis diagram shows a block representation of how an MRI system works, starting from signal generation to image display. At the heart of the scanner, you have the patient placed inside the bore surrounded by gradient coils and the RF, or radiofrequency coil. The RF coil serves two purposes — it transmits the excitation pulses into the body, and it also receives the weak signals emitted back from the tissue. To generate those pulses, a frequency synthesizer and an RF amplifier create the correct radiofrequency signal. That signal is then sent through a transmit–receive switch, which ensures that the same RF coil can switch roles between sending and receiving.\n\nOnce the RF coil receives the returning signal, it is very weak. So the signal first goes through a preamplifier to boost it. Then, it passes through a receiver blanking unit to protect the electronics during transmission. After that, the signal is routed to an RF amplifier and a demodulator, followed by a quadrature mixer, which separates the signal into its real and imaginary components. These components represent the complex-valued MRI signal.\n\nThe analog signal is then converted into a digital form by an analog-to-digital, or A/D, converter. From there, the digital data is stored temporarily in RAM memory and controlled by the host computer. The computer performs the essential reconstruction step — the two-dimensional inverse Fourier transform, or 2-D IFFT. This is what converts raw k-space data into an actual image that can be displayed.\n\nOn the control side of the system, there are waveform generator timing boards and gradient amplifiers. These control the gradient coils inside the scanner, which are responsible for slice selection, phase encoding, and frequency encoding. The pulse programmer and software interface, also controlled by the computer, dictate exactly when and how these gradients and RF pulses are applied. Together, this timing sequence ensures precise spatial encoding of the MRI signal, allowing us to reconstruct high-resolution images.\n\nSo overall, this diagram gives us a complete picture: from the RF system and gradient amplifiers, to signal detection, digitization, Fourier reconstruction, and finally, the image display. It ties together all the engineering components that make MRI imaging possible.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
