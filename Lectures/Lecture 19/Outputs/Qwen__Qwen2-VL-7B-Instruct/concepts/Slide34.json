From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAt this point, you might be wondering — have you understood this, or are you confused? Honestly, if you have never studied this carefully before, it is very natural to be confused. Even for me, when I first studied this, I had to go through it several times, very carefully, before I felt I understood it clearly.\n\nSo let’s check ourselves. If you basically follow the logical flow so far, you can feel confident. If you are quite confused, that’s also expected — because these concepts are tricky and require repeated review. If you’re somewhere in between, that’s normal too. The important thing is not to get discouraged. What I will do now is go over the same ideas again, but from a slightly different angle, with more detail and more illustrations, so that the picture becomes clearer.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Reject filler or administrative text.\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"understood\", \"category\": \"communication\"},\n    {\"term\": \"confused\", \"category\": \"communication\"},\n    {\"term\": \"logical flow\", \"category\": \"algorithm\"},\n    {\"term\": \"review\", \"category\": \"data_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"tricky\", \"category\": \"algorithm\"},\n    {\"term\": \"clearer\", \"category\": \"communication\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\n    \"If you basically follow the logical flow so far, you can feel confident.\",\n    \"If you are quite confused, that’s also expected — because these concepts are tricky and require repeated review.\",\n    \"If you’re somewhere in between, that’s normal too.
