From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nIn this lecture, we move into the second part of MRI imaging. The first part, as you saw in the video, focused on the underlying physical principles. Now, we will explain how MRI imaging is performed, based on those physical models and principles.\n\nIt’s best to begin by reading the chapter first. You may naturally have questions, but that’s exactly why you attend this lecture. Without that preparation, it’s often difficult to build a solid understanding. MRI is quite tricky—you need to carefully think about the concepts, the relationships, and revisit them several times. Hence, an iterative approach should be used to preview, discuss, and review, again and again.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Reject filler or administrative text.\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"underlying physical principles\", \"category\": \"physics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"MRI imaging\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"physical models\", \"category\": \"physics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"iterative approach\", \"category\": \"algorithm\"},\n    {\"term\": \"preparation\", \"category\": \"workflow\"},\n    {\"term\": \"understanding\", \"category\": \"algorithm\"},\n    {\"term\": \"tricky\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"carefully think\", \"category\": \"algorithm\"},\n    {\"term\": \"relationships\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"revisit\", \"category\": \"algorithm\"},\n    {\"term\": \"preview\", \"category\": \"algorithm\"},\n    {\"term\": \"discuss\", \"category\": \"algorithm\"},\n    {\"term\": \"review\", \"category\": \"algorithm\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\n    \"In this lecture, we move into the second part of MRI imaging.\",\n    \"The first part, as you saw in the video, focused on the underlying physical principles.\",\n    \"Now, we will explain how MRI imaging is performed, based on those physical models and",
