From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThis photo shows a preclinical MRI scanner, specifically the Bruker BioSpec Avance III 94/20 system, which operates at 9.4 Tesla. Unlike clinical MRI scanners that are designed for human patients, preclinical MRI systems are mainly used for small animals such as mice, rats, or rabbits. These scanners are critical in biomedical research because they allow scientists to study disease models, monitor treatment effects, and investigate basic biological processes in a controlled setting before moving to human trials.\n\nThe scanner looks similar in shape to a clinical MRI, with a large cylindrical magnet and a bore in the center, but the bore is much smaller since it is designed for animal studies. The extremely high magnetic field strength of 9.4 Tesla gives very high resolution and sensitivity, allowing researchers to visualize fine structural details that would not be possible at lower field strengths. With this scanner, scientists can measure anatomical structures, functional activity, and even molecular processes, all non-invasively.\n\nPreclinical MRI scanners like this one play a vital role in translational medicine, serving as a bridge between laboratory discoveries and clinical applications. By studying animal models of diseases such as cancer, stroke, or neurodegenerative disorders, researchers can optimize imaging protocols, test new therapies, and gather critical data before applying these methods in human patients.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
