From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, let me give you a simple example to make this clearer. Under the three approximations we just discussed, we can measure the Fourier space information. The figure on the left shows what is recorded in k-space. Remember, the Fourier transform is a complex function. It has both amplitude and phase. But what we display here is only the amplitude. It looks something like this, a distribution of intensities in k-space. \n\nThen, if you apply an inverse Fourier transformation, you obtain the image on the right, which is a cross-sectional image of the brain. So with MRI, by collecting data in k-space and applying an inverse Fourier transform, we can reconstruct detailed cross-sectional anatomy. I think this is really an amazing achievement — especially when you compare it with X-ray CT. MRI provides a completely different way of obtaining cross-sectional images, not from attenuation, but directly from signals in Fourier space.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
