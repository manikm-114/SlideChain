Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nTo measure T1, we often use a technique called inversion recovery. Here’s how it works. First, we apply a one-hundred-eighty-degree pulse. This flips the magnetization vector completely upside down. At this moment, there are no transverse components. Remember, only transverse components induce a signal in the nearby coil. Without a transverse component, if you place a coil close to the patient, there is no signal to measure.\n\nNow, after a time delay, tau, we apply a ninety-degree pulse. This rotates some of the magnetization into the transverse plane. And once that happens, the coil can detect a signal. This is the signal you see here. Notice that the signal itself also decays. Why? Because of dephasing. And ask yourself — is this dephasing due to T2, or due to T2 star? The answer is T2 star, because it includes both spin–spin interaction and the effect of field inhomogeneity.\n\nSo, this is the inversion recovery method: a one-eighty-degree pulse, followed by a time delay, and then a ninety-degree pulse that produces a measurable signal. The key question we then ask is, what is the amplitude of that signal?\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
