Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThe next important idea in MRI is called frequency encoding. After we finish phase encoding, we do not immediately record any signal. At that stage, the information is already encoded into the spins as phase shifts, but the signal is not read out yet. The next step is to apply what we call the frequency-encoding gradient, often denoted as G-sub-s, or simply the readout gradient. Once this gradient is applied, we begin recording the MR signal.\n\nWhat happens here is that the local magnetic field is no longer homogeneous. Instead, because of the gradient, the magnetic field strength changes linearly across the imaging plane. On the right-hand side, the field is stronger, and on the left-hand side, the field is weaker. This change in field strength directly affects the processional frequency of the spins. Spins that sit in regions of higher field will process faster, while those in lower field regions will process more slowly. This is a very clever way to extract spatial information from the signal.\n\nNow, when we measure the signal, if we see a component oscillating at a very high frequency, we know that signal must have come from spins located on the right-hand side of the image, where the field is strongest. Conversely, if the signal oscillates at a lower frequency, we know it must have come from the left-hand side, where the field is weaker. In other words, the frequency of the signal directly encodes the spatial position of the spins along the direction of the gradient.\n\nSo, the field is no longer uniform across the entire plane. Instead, the gradient introduces a mapping between position and frequency. The faster oscillations in the measured signal correspond to spins located toward the right side, while the slower oscillations correspond to spins on the left side. All of the low-frequency signals come from the left-hand side of the slice, and all of the high-frequency signals come from the right-hand side. By combining this frequency information with the phase information we already stored in the earlier phase-encoding step, we can now determine not only which row the signal came from, but also which column. In this way, we can resolve the precise pixel location of the signal within the slice.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
