Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAnd now, let’s talk about the actual signal we can measure in MRI, which is called the free induction decay, or FID. After applying a ninety-degree RF pulse, the net magnetization vector is flipped into the transverse plane. This transverse component of magnetization is constantly rotating around the main magnetic field, B zero. Because of this precession, the changing magnetic field induces an alternating electromagnetic field. And as you learned in high school physics, an alternating magnetic field induces an electric current in a nearby coil. So if we place a receiver coil close to the patient, that coil will detect this alternating signal. \n\nHowever, the signal does not last forever. It decays over time, and this decay is due to the T2-star relaxation. The spins gradually lose phase coherence, and the signal amplitude decreases exponentially. What we record is not a constant sine wave of fixed amplitude, but a damped oscillation that fades away with time. This decaying signal, directly measured from the whole sample, or from a whole slice if slice selection is applied, is the free induction decay, or FID. This is the fundamental NMR signal we detect in MRI.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
