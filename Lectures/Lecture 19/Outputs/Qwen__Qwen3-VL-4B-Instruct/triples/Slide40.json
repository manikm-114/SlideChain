Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, let’s take a look at some real examples of brain images. On the same slide, you can see three different types of images: rho-weighted, T1-weighted, and T2-weighted. In MRI, rho here means proton density weighting, not P-weighted. In the brain, there are mainly five important tissue types that we care about: grey matter, white matter, cerebrospinal fluid or CSF, blood, and water. If you look carefully at the table, you’ll notice that the T1 and T2 relaxation times are quite different for each tissue. \n\nFor example, grey matter has a T1 of about 1 second and a T2 of about 0.1 seconds, while CSF has a much longer T1 of around 2 seconds and a T2 of around 0.25 seconds. Water has even longer values, T1 about 4.7 seconds and T2 about 3.5 seconds. These differences are the key to MRI contrast. The very same slice of the brain can look dramatically different depending on whether you emphasize proton density, T1, or T2 weighting. \n\nSo, depending on your imaging parameters, you can choose to highlight different tissue characteristics. This is something CT cannot do, because CT only measures the attenuation coefficient mu. But MRI gives us much richer information because of rho, T1, and T2. And for a special case, we can use Gx gradient encoding to separate frequencies along the x-axis. That allows us to further refine how we differentiate tissue types based on their signal behavior.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
