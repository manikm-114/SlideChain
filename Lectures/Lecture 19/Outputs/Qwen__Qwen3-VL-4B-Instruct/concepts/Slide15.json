From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo now we move to the next part: being spatially specific.\nIn MRI, we don’t just want a signal from the whole sample. We want to isolate a particular slice. Not every layer, but just one slice. And not only that — within that slice, we also want to know the signal from each location.\n\nThat means we need to encode each pixel in a way that makes its signal slightly different from every other pixel. Only then can we reconstruct an image that shows the T1 and T2 values for each voxel.\nThe first step in this process is slice selection. We begin by defining which slice we want to image.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
