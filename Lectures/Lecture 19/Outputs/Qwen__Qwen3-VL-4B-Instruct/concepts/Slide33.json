From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let me explain this idea more generally. Here, tau, shown in green, is the time you spend applying the phase-encoding gradient. During this phase encoding, you introduce a phase difference across the spins, but you are not yet collecting any signal. After that, you let time t run, shown in red, and that is when you actually begin collecting the MR signal. This is the formulation with both phase encoding and frequency encoding included.\n\nWe first perform phase encoding longitudinally, then we do frequency encoding horizontally. But in fact, you can do this in different ways. You can apply gradients in both the vertical and horizontal directions simultaneously. When you do this, during the time tau, you move the starting phase point diagonally in k-space, depending on the relative strengths of the gradients. If you then start collecting signal immediately, the k-space trajectory begins from that shifted point. Alternatively, you might first move the starting point horizontally by applying one gradient, then switch to a vertical gradient and move to another position, and only then begin collecting the signal. Each different choice changes the trajectory you trace in k-space.\n\nFor example, if you use an x gradient for frequency encoding, then as time t increases from zero, the k x value changes continuously toward positive values. If instead you first apply a horizontal gradient as a phase-encoding step, the initial point shifts along the k x axis. Then, by applying a vertical gradient, you move the starting point vertically. Once you begin signal acquisition, you trace a horizontal or vertical line in k-space. Finally, if you apply both gradients at once and immediately collect the signal, you start at the origin and move along a straight line at a slope determined by the ratio of the two gradients.\n\nThe essential idea is that whenever you collect a signal with a gradient on, the frequency of precession is shifted, and that frequency determines the trajectory in k-space. If you apply a gradient without collecting a signal, the spins accumulate phase instead. By combining these options, you can navigate k-space in virtually any pattern. This flexibility is what allows MRI to encode spatial information and build an image slice by slice, pixel by pixel.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
