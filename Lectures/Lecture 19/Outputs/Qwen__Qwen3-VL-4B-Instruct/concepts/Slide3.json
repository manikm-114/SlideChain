From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThe first part of today’s lecture is a review, just in case you missed something earlier. Even if you understood it the first time, it’s always good to refresh these key concepts.\n\nThe key point is to model and understand T1 and T2, which are critical relaxation parameters. Along with these, proton density is also an essential factor, and fortunately, that one is fairly easy to understand. Think of it this way: you have a collection of small magnets, whose density is proportional to proton density, and together they form a large magnetization vector, usually called the big M vector. Once you begin to manipulate this M vector, you immediately see the effects of T1 and T2.\n\nT1 and T2 are intrinsic properties of tissues. They vary with tissue type, and they are very important for functional and even molecular imaging. You need to understand how the MRI signal changes under the influence of T1 and T2, and how these quantities can be measured. When you do this properly, you can create multi-contrast MRI images, such as proton-density-weighted, T1-weighted, and T2-weighted images.\n\nThis is much more complicated than what we encounter in X-ray imaging. In X-ray, the main parameter is the linear attenuation coefficient. Even though this coefficient is energy-dependent, it still gives us a straightforward measure: it tells us how many photons, or what fraction of photons, will be attenuated when an X-ray beam passes through a given thickness of a given tissue type.\n\nBy contrast, T1 and T2 are not so simple. They require more imagination—especially geometrical imagination—to grasp.\nNow, the remaining two parts of today’s lecture—slice selection and sampling in k-space—are where MRI becomes truly powerful. These steps allow us to extract MRI signals from the sample, or from the patient, in a spatially specific way. That’s how we generate cross-sectional or even volumetric images of the human body.\n\nIn summary: today we will begin by revisiting T1 and T2 modeling and measurement, and then move on to slice selection and k-space sampling. These latter two are really the emphasis of this lecture. In the previous session, we talked about MRI imaging principles. Now we will extend that foundation and see how it translates into actual imaging techniques.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
