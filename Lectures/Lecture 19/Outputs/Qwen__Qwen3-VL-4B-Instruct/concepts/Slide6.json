From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nWhenever you have a governing relationship like this, you can go through some mathematical steps.\n\nWith the first derivative like this, you just rearrange it a little bit. So you have:\u000b(one over y) d-y equals k d-t.\nThen, integrate both sides of the equation. On the left, you get ln absolute y, and on the right, you get k t plus C.\n\nNow, exponentiate both sides. That gives:\u000by equals A e to the k t, where A is a constant.\n\nThis shows that whenever the process is described by a first-order differential equation, the solution must be of this form: y is exponential growth or exponential decay. In other words, a constant multiplied by an exponential function, with index k t, where t is time.\n\nSo, this explains why you see exponential decay, exponential growth, or attenuation in earlier imaging modalities like X-ray imaging, and why you see the same behavior here in MRI.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
