From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s put everything together. The phase angle that you see here carries important spatial meaning. Spins at the top of the slice accumulate a smaller phase angle, while spins at the bottom accumulate a larger phase angle. So when you combine phase encoding with frequency encoding, you can start to separate the signals point by point within the slice. This is the basic idea of how we move from bulk signals to localized, pixel-specific information.\n\nYou may wonder, why do we need two more gradient fields? At the very beginning, we already used a slice-selection gradient — let’s say along the z-direction — to pick out one slice from the entire volume. But that only gives us localization in one dimension. To fully resolve the slice, we need to further encode along the other two directions: the y-direction for phase encoding, and the x-direction for frequency encoding. By applying gradients step by step, we gradually eliminate one dimension at a time. Slice selection removes the z-dimension, phase encoding handles the y-dimension, and frequency encoding takes care of the x-dimension. The end result is three-dimensional, point-specific localization of the MR signal. This is the foundation of tomographic imaging.\n\nMathematically, we can describe this process using the equations shown here. If we only apply frequency encoding without phase encoding, the acquired signal is expressed as an integral over the slice that includes a factor of “e to the minus j gamma G-x times x times t.” This captures spatial frequency information along the x-direction. But when we combine both phase encoding and frequency encoding, the signal equation becomes the one you see at the bottom of the slide. Here, you have an additional factor of “e to the minus j gamma G-y times y times tau p-e.” This accounts for the phase encoding gradient applied in the y-direction for a certain time tau p-e.\n\nNow, looking at this combined equation, you can see it resembles a Fourier transformation. You have terms in both the x and y directions — frequency terms in x, and phase terms in y. Together, they allow us to map spatial coordinates into measurable signal space. This is the mathematical backbone of MRI imaging. We will go deeper into this Fourier interpretation later in the lecture. But for now, recognize that the combination of slice selection, phase encoding, and frequency encoding provides us with true point-wise information. Graphically, as shown here, this is exactly how the imaging sequence works.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
