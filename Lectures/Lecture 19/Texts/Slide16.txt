So this is about the processional frequency on B. In the textbook, we actually mentioned this in the previous lecture..

But let’s focus on the conclusion. The derivation goes through all these steps, and if you take the time, you will understand the details.
The key point is this: the processional frequency is proportional to the local magnetic field. That means if the overall field is stronger, the M vector — or you can think of it as a spinning top — will process faster.

So just follow the picture here. The last line is very clear: the angular frequency of precession, omega, is proportional to the local magnetic field. If we call the main field B-naught, then omega is proportional to B-naught. Later on, if you change B-naught to B-prime, omega will be proportional to B-prime.
And then you multiply by a physical constant, called gamma.

 So, in short, omega equals gamma times B.
