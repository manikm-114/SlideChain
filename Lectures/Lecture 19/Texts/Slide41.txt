Here we are looking at a special case: Gx gradient encoding. That means we apply a linear gradient along the x-axis, so that the precession frequency depends directly on the coordinate x. In this case, the signal we observe combines several effects: proton density, T1 recovery, and T2 decay. 

You can see the equation here: the amplitude of the local signal depends on rho, multiplied by the term for partial recovery due to T1, and multiplied again by the decay due to T2. This gives the overall signal strength at each location. Then, with the Gx gradient, we impose a position-dependent frequency shift. That’s why the exponential factor here involves Gx times x. 

So, summarizing: the total signal is complex, but you can think of it as having two parts — the amplitude of the local signal, determined by rho, T1, and T2, and the frequency of the local signal, determined by the gradient. This separation is very useful because it tells us what portion of the signal comes from tissue properties, and what portion comes from our encoding scheme. This prepares us for data collection in k-space.
