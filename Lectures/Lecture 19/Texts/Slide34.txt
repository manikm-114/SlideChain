At this point, you might be wondering — have you understood this, or are you confused? Honestly, if you have never studied this carefully before, it is very natural to be confused. Even for me, when I first studied this, I had to go through it several times, very carefully, before I felt I understood it clearly.

So let’s check ourselves. If you basically follow the logical flow so far, you can feel confident. If you are quite confused, that’s also expected — because these concepts are tricky and require repeated review. If you’re somewhere in between, that’s normal too. The important thing is not to get discouraged. What I will do now is go over the same ideas again, but from a slightly different angle, with more detail and more illustrations, so that the picture becomes clearer.
