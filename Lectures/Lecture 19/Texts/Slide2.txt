Again, let us see where we are.  We started with medical physics—specifically MRI physics—in the first lecture. Now, we move to MR imaging. In our next lecture, we’ll talk about MRI pulse sequences, which will give us a more specific look at how MRI is applied in practice.

However, today, our goal is to first revisit what we have learned so far.
