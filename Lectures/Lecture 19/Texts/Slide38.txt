And I said that you can collect a signal with a nearby coil. Then, if you place another coil, you can also get a signal. Remember, the horizontal component of the magnetization is a rotational vector. So the signal actually has two parts. It depends both on amplitude and on phase. The signal detected along the x-axis and the signal detected along the y-axis naturally have a ninety-degree phase difference, because the magnetization keeps rotating. That makes the signal a complex-valued quantity.

So, let’s describe it mathematically. You can record Sx, which is modulated as M zero. After a ninety-degree pulse, this transverse signal is subject to spin echo formation and also subject to T2 decay. The Sx term represents the amplitude and the frequency content along the x-axis. Likewise, you have a Sy component, which is just the complementary sine term. Together, these two components give you both cosine and sine contributions. If we put them into compact form, we can write the signal as a complex number: a real part and an imaginary part. This gives us a very compact, complex-valued signal representation. In this notation, I have chosen to place the imaginary part corresponding to Sy. This is just a convention. The coding system can be chosen differently. Here, I simply make Sy the imaginary component. But for physical measurement, both the real part and the imaginary part are equally meaningful. We use complex notation mainly for convenience.

This idea is similar to what we saw in Fourier series and Fourier transforms, where using a complex exponential makes the notation compact, but the actual measured signal is real. Any complex form can always be converted back into a purely real form if needed.
Now, the processional frequency is omega zero, determined by the main field B zero. The transverse magnetization keeps processing at this angular frequency omega zero. If we use a rotating frame—meaning we mentally rotate our coordinate system at the same frequency as the spins—then the signal appears stationary. In the rotating frame, the oscillatory part is removed, and the signal just decays exponentially with T2. This makes the description much simpler.
So, this is the signal in the rotating frame: stationary, but still decaying, due to T2 relaxation. And remember, T two decay is a physiological property. We cannot control it; it reflects interactions within the tissue itself.

Now, what about repetition? The MRI sequence is repeated after a certain repetition time, TR. If TR is not long enough, the longitudinal magnetization, M zero, has not fully recovered. T1 relaxation determines how much of the original longitudinal magnetization is available at the start of the next cycle. So, after TR, the signal amplitude depends on both T1 recovery and T2 decay.
The total signal at time t is therefore a combination of these factors: proton density, hidden inside M zero; T1 recovery, which determines how much longitudinal magnetization has returned; and T2 decay, which determines how fast the transverse signal fades. Together, these biological properties determine tissue contrast.
On top of that, we have technical parameters: B zero, the main magnetic field; TR, the repetition time; and TE, the echo time. These are under our control. They don’t reflect patient pathology, but our technical choices in the scan.

Now, why do we need repetition in the first place? Recall that in phase encoding, each time you collect data, you only get one line in k-space. Frequency encoding samples along that line, but since k-space is two-dimensional, you need multiple phase-encoding steps. That means repeating the sequence many times. This is very much like CT scanning, where helical scanning or fan-beam scanning requires repeated projections. In MRI, k-space must be filled line by line, and that requires repetition.

If TR is very long, M zero is fully recovered between repetitions. That gives you clean, strong signals, but scanning takes longer. If TR is too short, M zero hasn’t fully recovered, so the signal is weaker. But shorter TR also means faster scanning. So there is a tradeoff: longer TR improves image quality, shorter TR reduces scan time. The goal is always to balance scan speed with image quality for the clinical application.

Finally, both TR and TE can be adjusted to emphasize different tissue properties. A short TR and short TE give you T1-weighted images. A long TR and long TE give you T2-weighted images. Proton density weighting lies somewhere in between. So, this signal model for a ninety-degree pulse captures both the biological properties of tissue—proton density, T1, and T2—and the technical factors—B zero, TR, TE, and time. Together, they shape the MRI signal and ultimately determine the image contrast.
