So now we move to the next part: being spatially specific.
In MRI, we don’t just want a signal from the whole sample. We want to isolate a particular slice. Not every layer, but just one slice. And not only that — within that slice, we also want to know the signal from each location.

That means we need to encode each pixel in a way that makes its signal slightly different from every other pixel. Only then can we reconstruct an image that shows the T1 and T2 values for each voxel.
The first step in this process is slice selection. We begin by defining which slice we want to image.
