Graphically, we can show this as you see on the slide.
The gradient field creates a range of resonance frequencies along the z-axis. When you send an RF pulse with a defined frequency range, only the spins within that frequency range — and therefore within a specific z-range — are excited.

That z-range corresponds to the slice thickness. So this is how we select a slice in MRI.
What we’ve explained here is the principle for slice selection along the z-axis.
