So here we come to the full sequence that combines slice selection, phase encoding, and frequency encoding. The process begins with a ninety-degree pulse. This radiofrequency pulse flips the magnetization vector, the big M vector, into the x-y plane. Once it is in the x-y plane, the transverse components begin to process, and these processing components induce an alternating magnetic field around the patient or the sample. That alternating field is what we measure as the MR signal.

Now, you want to make sure that you are not flipping every spin in the body. You only want to flip the spins within a single slice. That is where slice selection comes in. During the ninety-degree pulse, you apply a slice selection gradient. This gradient ensures that only the spins that are resonant within that slice frequency range are flipped into the x-y plane. Spins outside the slice are not flipped, and so they do not contribute to the signal. This is the first major step — slice selection removes one dimension, narrowing the signal to a single slice.

Next, you apply phase encoding. On the slide, you see these multiple horizontal lines under the label “G-phase.” This is because phase encoding must be repeated multiple times with different gradient strengths. You can start from a minimum value, then gradually increase step by step, covering a full range of gradient amplitudes. Each phase encoding step imprints a different spatially dependent phase shift onto the spins along the y-direction. Why do we need so many lines? The reason is the Fourier transformation. To fully reconstruct an image, we need information along two degrees of freedom — one for the phase dimension and one for the frequency dimension. Each phase encoding line is like collecting one row of data in Fourier space, which we call k-space.

After that, we apply frequency encoding, shown here as “G-freq.” Frequency encoding happens during the readout. With this gradient on, different spatial locations along the x-direction correspond to different precession frequencies. When you record the signal, you collect a series of oscillations that map into the x-axis of k-space. Each readout provides you with N data points along this horizontal axis.

So, putting everything together: for each phase encoding step, you collect one frequency-encoded readout with N data points. After repeating this process with many different phase encoding steps, you end up with a full grid of data — N by N points. Each row comes from one phase encoding, and each column comes from the frequency encoding readout. Altogether, this maps the entire cross-section of the slice into k-space. Then, by applying a two-dimensional Fourier transform, you reconstruct the final image.

This is the essence of Fourier imaging, or what we call k-space formulation in MRI. Slice selection removes one dimension, phase encoding handles the y-dimension, and frequency encoding handles the x-dimension. The result is a complete two-dimensional image of the selected slice, pixel by pixel.
