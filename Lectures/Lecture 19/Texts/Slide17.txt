Now, if you want to explore a little more detail, you can check the derivation for this mechanical precession of motion.
In this case, the angular frequency is proportional to the gravitational force. I’ve marked it in green on the slide. This is basically a physics analogy using a spinning top and torque.

If you’re interested, you can read it. Otherwise, don’t worry too much — it’s not essential for our discussion of MRI.
