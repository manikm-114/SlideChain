So here’s another way to see the spin echo.

You start with the magnetization vector. Apply a ninety-degree pulse, and now you have transverse components. These transverse components begin to dephase — some spins are slower, shown in red, and some spins are faster, shown in black.

Next, you apply a one-hundred-eighty-degree pulse. This instantly flips the distribution. The red, slower spins are moved to the position where the black, faster spins were, and the black spins take the place of the red ones. But remember, the red spins are inherently slower. So even though they were moved ahead, they continue to process slowly. The black spins are inherently faster, so even though they were moved behind, they continue to process quickly.

Now, after the same amount of time passes, both groups realign again. The faster black spins catch up, and the slower red spins fall into place. At that moment, all the spins point together again, aligned in the same direction.

Because they are all aligned, their contributions add up constructively, and the transverse magnetization reaches its maximum. This produces a measurable signal in the nearby coils — the spin echo signal.
