From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s finish with some important points about X-ray radiation. X-rays are much more energetic than visible light. We experience visible light all the time—sunshine, for example—which is generally considered healthy.\nBut X-rays have much shorter wavelengths, roughly from 0.1 nanometers to 10 nanometers, and much higher energy.\nBecause X-ray photons carry so much energy, they can break molecular bonds in biological tissues. This damage can potentially cause genetic mutations, which are often harmful.\n\nIn the long term, such mutations may increase the risk of cancer or other genetic diseases.\nThere is some debate, though. Some argue that small doses of radiation might even be beneficial, similar to exercise, causing small stress that strengthens the body.\n\nIn this view, controlled, moderate radiation exposure acts like a vitamin, gently challenging the body to repair and strengthen itself.\nWhile that perspective exists in some articles, the general consensus is caution.\nAs CT imaging, especially advanced methods like helical CT for lung cancer screening, becomes more widespread, concerns about radiation dose increase.\n\nPatients receive higher cumulative doses, and this raises public health questions.\nSo, it is crucial to focus on how we can reduce radiation dose and how we measure it in the first place.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
