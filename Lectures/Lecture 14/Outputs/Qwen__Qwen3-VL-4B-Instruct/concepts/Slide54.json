From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThis concept of multiple scan average dose, or MSAD, is defined by an integral calculation.\nRadiation dose from neighboring scans contributes to the dose in the current scan.\nThe number of adjacent scans considered is represented by N.\n\nYou perform the integration over the radiation dose profile, then normalize it by the slice thickness.\nThis normalization accounts for the actual tissue volume receiving radiation.\nMSAD is another classic measure of radiation dose in CT.\nWith the rise of helical CT, there are new adaptations of these dose measurements, including for helical scanning and combined bimodal CT systems.\n\nHowever, the fundamental principle behind measuring radiation dose remains the same.\nAs I mentioned earlier, understanding how we measure the release dose is essential to managing patient exposure.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
