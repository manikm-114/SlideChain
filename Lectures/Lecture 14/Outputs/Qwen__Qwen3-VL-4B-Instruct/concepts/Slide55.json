From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nTo measure radiation dose, we use specialized instruments called dosimeters.\nI personally had the opportunity to work on radiation dose measurements for CT scanners during my time at Washington University School of Medicine.\n\nIt was engaging and valuable research work, and I frequently used dosimetry equipment to evaluate radiation output.\nThese dosimeters help assess the radiation delivered by the scanner, ensuring safety and proper calibration.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
