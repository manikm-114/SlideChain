From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet me explain the basic concepts from your Green Book regarding radiation dose.\nX-ray radiation is a form of electromagnetic radiation, and when it passes through your body, energy is deposited into your tissues. This energy deposited is called the absorbed dose.\n\nThe absorbed dose is a physical measurement of energy per unit mass of tissue, expressed in grays. One gray equals one joule per kilogram.\nThis is the fundamental concept of radiation dose—the energy your body absorbs from X-rays.\nHowever, from a health perspective, the effective dose equivalent is more relevant.\nTo calculate this, the human body is divided into multiple organs or regions because different organs have different sensitivities to radiation.\nSome tissues, like those involved in reproduction or rapidly regenerating cells, are more sensitive to radiation damage.\nTherefore, younger women, children, and reproductive organs require special caution to avoid excessive exposure.\nThis sensitivity is accounted for by weighting factors, denoted by W.\n\nThe dose equivalent, represented by H, combines the absorbed dose with factors related to the type and energy of radiation.\nHigher energy photons or particles generally cause more biological damage per unit of absorbed energy.\nFor example, X-rays, gamma rays, and alpha particles differ in their relative biological effectiveness.\nTo account for this, a quality factor, QF, is applied to quantify the biological impact of different radiation types.\n\nFor X-ray CT, the QF is normalized to one, but other radiation types have different values.\nThus, the effective dose equivalent is calculated using these weighted factors, resulting in a more accurate estimation of biological risk.\nThis calculation is summarized by a formula sometimes noted as equation 1.30 in radiation safety literature.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
