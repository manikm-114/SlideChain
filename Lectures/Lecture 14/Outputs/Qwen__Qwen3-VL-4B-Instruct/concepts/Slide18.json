From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHelical or spiral CT began with single-slice scanning using a linear detector array, capturing rays in two dimensions.\nExpanding this, cone beam helical spiral CT was developed. For cone beam spiral CT, the issue of data truncation is addressed more intricately.\nIf you slice through the patient in any plane, the actual X-ray beam forms a fan beam in that plane.\n\nThis fan beam is longitudinally truncated because the patient’s body is quite long, and the detector size limits the coverage. You cannot cover the whole body with a single cone beam at once.\n\nOften, you focus on smaller regions of interest like the heart or inner ear, so using a huge cone beam isn’t practical.\nConsequently, data truncation naturally occurs in helical cone beam scanning, making it an important consideration in advanced CT imaging.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
