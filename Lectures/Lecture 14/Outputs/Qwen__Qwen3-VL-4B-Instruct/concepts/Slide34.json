From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nDifferent body regions use different CT number windows for display. These windows are defined by minimum and maximum CT numbers, depending on the manufacturer or clinical application.\n\nFor instance, the full range of CT numbers might be mapped to 256 grayscale levels on a display, from white to black.\nThe human eye can typically distinguish about 50 shades within a window.\nIf too many shades are presented, subtle differences become difficult to see.\n\nFor lung imaging, for example, you might set the window maximum to about 250 Hounsfield units and the minimum to the air value.\nWithin this window, 256 gray levels help render tissues clearly. Anything outside the window appears clipped and is not visible.\nThis windowing is critical to tailoring visualization to different clinical needs.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Reject filler or administrative text.\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\n      \"term\": \"Different body regions use different CT number windows for display.\",\n      \"category\": \"modality\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"These windows are defined by minimum and maximum CT numbers, depending on the manufacturer or clinical application.\",\n      \"category\": \"modality\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"For instance, the full range of CT numbers might be mapped to 256 grayscale levels on a display, from white to black.\",\n      \"category\": \"data_processing\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"The human eye can typically distinguish about 50 shades within a window.\",\n      \"category\": \"quality_metric\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"If too many shades are presented, subtle differences become difficult to see.\",\n      \"category\": \"quality_metric\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"For lung imaging, for example, you might set the window maximum to about 250 Hounsfield units and the minimum to the air value.\",\n      \"category\": \"modality\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"Within this window, 256 gray levels help render tissues clearly.\",\n      \"category\": \"data_processing",
