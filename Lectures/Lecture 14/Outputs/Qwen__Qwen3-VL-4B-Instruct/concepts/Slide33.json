From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nCT reconstruction relies on CT numbers, which are derived from Beer's law. Beer's law relates the incoming and attenuated X-ray intensities via a parameter called the linear attenuation coefficient, mu.\nData processing converts raw measurements into line integrals, which are then used to reconstruct mu values throughout the image.\n\nOn the CT monitor, you don’t see mu values directly but relative values compared to water, since the human body is mostly water.\nThus, CT numbers indicate how much more or less dense a region is than water.\nFor example, bone has a CT number over 1000, air has about -1000, and water is defined as zero. The range is often magnified by 1000 times for visualization.\n\nThis scale is sometimes called Hounsfield units, named after Sir Godfrey Hounsfield, the British engineer who developed the first CT scanner, which earned him a Nobel Prize for its revolutionary capability to reveal internal structures.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
