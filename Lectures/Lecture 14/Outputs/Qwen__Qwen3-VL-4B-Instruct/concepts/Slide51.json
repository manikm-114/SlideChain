From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, let me explain the concept of the radiation dose profile, sometimes called the releasing profile.\n\nImagine you perform a circular CT scan. This scanning method reconstructs images within a single plane, called the XY plane.\nIdeally, the X-ray beam would be finely collimated so that all photons are confined within the slice thickness, represented as a neat rectangular region—say, highlighted in yellow.\n\nHowever, in reality, the system is not perfect.\nYou have scattered photons, and the emission is not perfectly confined.\nTherefore, the actual radiation dose profile follows a curve, often shown as a blue curve.\nThis means that, even though you intend to irradiate only the slice thickness, some dose extends beyond this region.\nThis dose \"tail\" outside the intended slice area also contributes to the total patient radiation exposure.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
