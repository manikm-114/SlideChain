From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAnother way to think about radiation dose is through the dose profile measured over multiple circular scans.\n\nWhen you perform one circular scan, you get a certain dose distribution.\nIf you then do a second circular scan, you’ll get a similar dose profile again.\nWhen multiple scans are performed, each scan adds its own dose profile.\n\nThese multiple dose profiles overlap, contributing to the total radiation dose the patient receives.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
