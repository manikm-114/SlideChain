From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNext, we have partial volume averaging artifacts. For each slice, if a tumor only partially lies within that slice, you might not see it clearly. Small tumors can be especially difficult to detect when they occupy only half of a slice, and image noise further complicates clear visualization.\n\nHowever, with spiral CT, you can select longitudinal positions as densely as you want. This gives you a real opportunity to reconstruct images densely enough. One of the reconstructed slices is likely to contain the tumor fully, providing much better contrast resolution and visibility.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
