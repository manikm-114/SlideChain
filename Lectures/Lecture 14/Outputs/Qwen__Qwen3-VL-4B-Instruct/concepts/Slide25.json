From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet me add some comparison between classic CT and interior tomography.\n\nAccording to classical theory, which we learned and which I explained in textbooks, you need to collect all data to satisfy the data sufficiency condition—usually a fan beam or cone beam that covers the entire cross-section or object.\nThe data must comprehensively cover the object for accurate reconstruction.\nInterior tomography, however, only requires partial data limited to the region of interest.\n\nThus, with filtered backprojection, classic CT reconstructs a global image, like a wholesale business covering the entire area.\nInterior tomography reconstructs a smaller, targeted area—like retail shopping.\nThis opens up new opportunities, providing flexibility and precision.\nYou only need to shoot X-rays through the important region, reducing dose and focusing on clinical needs.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Reject filler or administrative text.\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\n      \"term\": \"classic ct\",\n      \"category\": \"modality\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"interior tomography\",\n      \"category\": \"modality\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"data sufficiency condition\",\n      \"category\": \"mathematics\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"fan beam or cone beam\",\n      \"category\": \"physics\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"filtered backprojection\",\n      \"category\": \"reconstruction\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"global image\",\n      \"category\": \"reconstruction\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"smaller, targeted area\",\n      \"category\": \"reconstruction\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"region of interest\",\n      \"category\": \"anatomy\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"truncated projection data\",\n      \"category\": \"data_processing\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"reducing dose\",\n      \"category\": \"physics\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"focusing on clinical needs\",\n      \"category\": \"modality\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\n    \"According to",
