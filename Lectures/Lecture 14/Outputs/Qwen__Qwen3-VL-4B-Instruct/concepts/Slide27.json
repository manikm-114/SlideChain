From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, let me explain CT scanner architecture. To reconstruct images, we rely on line integrals from X-ray projections, using filtered backprojection and Fourier transform-based reconstruction, or interior tomography for region-of-interest reconstruction.\nTo acquire this data, you need hardware: the CT scanner itself. This is a donut-shaped structure called the gantry, which is the framework holding all components.\n\nInside, you find X-ray sources and collimators that shape the beam and filter out low-energy X-rays. Low-energy photons won’t penetrate the patient and only add an unwanted dose.\nCollimators also reject scattered radiation to ensure the measured signal corresponds closely to the direct line integrals.\n\nThe scanner is a sophisticated device: you place the patient in the gantry, and from that, you acquire many images that resolve internal structures clearly.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
