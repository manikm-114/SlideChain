From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSeveral years ago, we undertook an innovative project and received some news coverage about it.\n\nWe built a CT scanner that does not rotate the gantry as in conventional designs.\nInstead, the patient lies on a rotating table—literally a sheet that turns—while the X-ray tube and detector remain fixed in place.\nThe gantry is simplified to just a tube and a detector, with no mechanical rotation during imaging.\nWe then perform the translation of the table and the scanning components.\n\nAlthough this setup limits the viewing angle compared to traditional systems, it still produces good-quality images.\nIf you like, you can think creatively or artistically about how this concept could be extended to robotic scanners deployed in autonomous vehicles or portable scanners for versatile use.\n\nThis is all just for fun and imagination.\nThat’s all for today.\nThank you for your attention.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
