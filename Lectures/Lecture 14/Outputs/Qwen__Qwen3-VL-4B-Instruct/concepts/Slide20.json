From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThis particular paper became the first seminal work on helical cone beam scanning and has been widely cited.\n\nToday, multi-slice cone beam helical scanning is widely used, with between 100 and 200 million such CT scans performed worldwide each year. This number highlights how prevalent and important this technology has become.\n\nReflecting on that time, we didn’t file any patents on this work, which turned out to be a major missed opportunity. Had we filed for intellectual property, it could have been extremely valuable.\nHelical scanning combines multiple technologies, including slip ring transmission, X-ray sources, and sophisticated reconstruction algorithms. The software scanning model itself is crucial to performance.\n\nTo put it in perspective: even if each scan were worth only one cent, with a million scans annually, that’s a million dollars a year in potential revenue.\nSo, not securing patent protection was probably the biggest mistake we made. Nonetheless, our original paper still stands as the prototype of this important process and algorithm.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
