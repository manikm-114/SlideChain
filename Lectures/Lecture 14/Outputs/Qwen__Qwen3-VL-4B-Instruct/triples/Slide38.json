Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nTemporal resolution, so you see conventional CP scanning. You do one slice at a time. Then you\nmove the patient into the country by a small increment. Do again, patient, keep pressing. \n\nSo from slice to slice, you see some discontinuity. So this is not due to some pathological feature.\nIt's really due to motion artifacts that show the temporal resolution agent is good enough. But\nWith helical scanning, it's smoothed out, but you have some longitudinal blurring.\n\nHere is the earlier algorithm. Later, I mentioned overlapping reconstruction. You really can\nrecover an image longitudinally and a better resolution than conventional scanning. Anyway,\nso we wouldn't have time to go into details.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"s\": \"Temporal Resolution\",\n      \"p\": \"depends_on\",\n      \"o\": \"Scanning speed\",\n      \"modalities\": [\n        \"text\"\n      ],\n      \"confidence\": 0.9,\n      \"evidence\": \"Depending on • Scanning speed\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"s\": \"Temporal Resolution\",\n      \"p\": \"depends_on\",\n      \"o\": \"Reconstruction method\",\n      \"modalities\": [\n        \"text\"\n      ],\n      \"confidence\": 0.9,\n      \"evidence\": \"Depending on • Reconstruction method\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"s\": \"Conventional Scanning\",\n      \"p\": \"produces\",\n      \"o\": \"Through-plane motion artifacts\",\n      \"modalities\": [\n        \"text\"\n      ],\n      \"confidence\": 0.8,\n      \"evidence\": \"Through-plane motion artifacts are suppressed by single-breath-hold spiral scanning\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"s\": \"Spiral Scanning\",\n      \"p\": \"suppresses\",\n      \"o\": \"Through-plane motion artifacts\",\n      \"modalities\": [\n        \"text\"\n      ],\n      \"confidence\": 0.",
