Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nIn the new approach, we assume there is no known sub-region.\nInstead, we model the region of interest as composed of finitely many sub-regions, each modeled by piecewise polynomials.\n\nThe boundaries of these sub-regions need not be known in advance. Each sub-region can be approximated by constant, quadratic, or more general multivariable polynomials.\nThis assumption matches the idea of band-limited signals from sampling theory.\nWith this sparsity-based model, where the ROI is decomposed into a small number of smooth regions, the interior reconstruction problem becomes solvable.\n\nFor example, in a chest CT scan, you can reconstruct the whole chest from all data or just from truncated data restricted to an ROI.\nHere is a real dataset scanned on a Siemens scanner demonstrating this.\nInterior tomography is no longer a mathematical curiosity but delivers practically good reconstruction results.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"s\": \"The Region of Interest (ROI)\",\n      \"p\": \"reconstructs_with\",\n      \"o\": \"piecewise polynomial\",\n      \"modalities\": [\n        \"text\"\n      ],\n      \"confidence\": 0.95,\n      \"evidence\": \"The Region of Interest (ROI) is Piecewise Polynomial, or\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"s\": \"interior tomography\",\n      \"p\": \"reconstructs_with\",\n      \"o\": \"all data or truncated data\",\n      \"modalities\": [\n        \"text\"\n      ],\n      \"confidence\": 0.9,\n      \"evidence\": \"you can reconstruct the whole chest from all data or just from truncated data restricted to an ROI.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
