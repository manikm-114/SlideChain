Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThe Fourier transform, as we learned, is the foundation of classic CT theory. It requires complete coverage of an entire cross-section or the whole object. When you have projection data, you can use the Fourier slice theorem in 2D or 3D, and then perform the inverse Fourier transform also in 2D or 3D. This classical framework is called the central dogma.\n\nThe whole cross-section or entire object must be fully covered by the X-ray beam. No matter the shape of the beam, you can always re-bin the data into parallel beam geometry. Then, the collected data can be inversely transformed back to the original image domain. That’s the fundamental way image reconstruction is performed.\n\nAs we learned, filtered back projection is essentially just the inverse Fourier transform represented in polar coordinates. This core concept explains the process pretty well. If you follow this, you should grasp the essential idea. In my opinion, the key question is: what is the difference between classic CT theory and modern CT theory?\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
