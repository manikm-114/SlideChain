Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, let me explain CT scanner architecture. To reconstruct images, we rely on line integrals from X-ray projections, using filtered backprojection and Fourier transform-based reconstruction, or interior tomography for region-of-interest reconstruction.\nTo acquire this data, you need hardware: the CT scanner itself. This is a donut-shaped structure called the gantry, which is the framework holding all components.\n\nInside, you find X-ray sources and collimators that shape the beam and filter out low-energy X-rays. Low-energy photons won’t penetrate the patient and only add an unwanted dose.\nCollimators also reject scattered radiation to ensure the measured signal corresponds closely to the direct line integrals.\n\nThe scanner is a sophisticated device: you place the patient in the gantry, and from that, you acquire many images that resolve internal structures clearly.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": []\n}",
