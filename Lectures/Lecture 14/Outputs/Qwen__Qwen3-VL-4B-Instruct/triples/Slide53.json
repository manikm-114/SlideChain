Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAnother way to think about radiation dose is through the dose profile measured over multiple circular scans.\n\nWhen you perform one circular scan, you get a certain dose distribution.\nIf you then do a second circular scan, you’ll get a similar dose profile again.\nWhen multiple scans are performed, each scan adds its own dose profile.\n\nThese multiple dose profiles overlap, contributing to the total radiation dose the patient receives.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"s\": \"Radiation Dose from Multiple Scans Are Accumulated in the Central Slice\",\n      \"p\": \"represents\",\n      \"o\": \"Real profile\",\n      \"modalities\": [\n        \"text\",\n        \"image\"\n      ],\n      \"confidence\": 0.9,\n      \"evidence\": \"Radiation Dose from Multiple Scans Are Accumulated in the Central Slice\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
