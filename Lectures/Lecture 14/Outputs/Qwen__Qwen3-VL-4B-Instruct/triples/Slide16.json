Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNext, we have partial volume averaging artifacts. For each slice, if a tumor only partially lies within that slice, you might not see it clearly. Small tumors can be especially difficult to detect when they occupy only half of a slice, and image noise further complicates clear visualization.\n\nHowever, with spiral CT, you can select longitudinal positions as densely as you want. This gives you a real opportunity to reconstruct images densely enough. One of the reconstructed slices is likely to contain the tumor fully, providing much better contrast resolution and visibility.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"s\": \"spiral ct\",\n      \"p\": \"reconstructs_with\",\n      \"o\": \"longitudinal positions\",\n      \"modalities\": [\n        \"text\",\n        \"image\"\n      ],\n      \"confidence\": 0.9,\n      \"evidence\": \"With spiral CT, you can select longitudinal positions as densely as you want.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"s\": \"retrospective reconstruction\",\n      \"p\": \"produces\",\n      \"o\": \"better lesion detectability\",\n      \"modalities\": [\n        \"text\",\n        \"image\"\n      ],\n      \"confidence\": 0.9,\n      \"evidence\": \"Retrospective Reconstruction Gives Better Lesion Detectability If There Are Sufficiently Many Slices Reconstructed!\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
