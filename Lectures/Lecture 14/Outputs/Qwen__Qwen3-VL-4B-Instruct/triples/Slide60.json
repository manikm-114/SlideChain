Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSeveral years ago, we undertook an innovative project and received some news coverage about it.\n\nWe built a CT scanner that does not rotate the gantry as in conventional designs.\nInstead, the patient lies on a rotating table—literally a sheet that turns—while the X-ray tube and detector remain fixed in place.\nThe gantry is simplified to just a tube and a detector, with no mechanical rotation during imaging.\nWe then perform the translation of the table and the scanning components.\n\nAlthough this setup limits the viewing angle compared to traditional systems, it still produces good-quality images.\nIf you like, you can think creatively or artistically about how this concept could be extended to robotic scanners deployed in autonomous vehicles or portable scanners for versatile use.\n\nThis is all just for fun and imagination.\nThat’s all for today.\nThank you for your attention.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"s\": \"CT scanner\",\n      \"p\": \"uses\",\n      \"o\": \"rotating table\",\n      \"modalities\": [\"text\", \"image\"],\n      \"confidence\": 0.9,\n      \"evidence\": \"We built a CT scanner that does not rotate the gantry as in conventional designs.
