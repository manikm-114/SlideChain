From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nIn the new approach, we assume there is no known sub-region.\nInstead, we model the region of interest as composed of finitely many sub-regions, each modeled by piecewise polynomials.\n\nThe boundaries of these sub-regions need not be known in advance. Each sub-region can be approximated by constant, quadratic, or more general multivariable polynomials.\nThis assumption matches the idea of band-limited signals from sampling theory.\nWith this sparsity-based model, where the ROI is decomposed into a small number of smooth regions, the interior reconstruction problem becomes solvable.\n\nFor example, in a chest CT scan, you can reconstruct the whole chest from all data or just from truncated data restricted to an ROI.\nHere is a real dataset scanned on a Siemens scanner demonstrating this.\nInterior tomography is no longer a mathematical curiosity but delivers practically good reconstruction results.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
