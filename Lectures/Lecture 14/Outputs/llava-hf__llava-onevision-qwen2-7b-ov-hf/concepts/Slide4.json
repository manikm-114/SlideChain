From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAs we discussed in the previous lecture, when you collect X-ray projection data from an unimpeded perspective, you aim to reconstruct the image layer by layer, starting from the outermost shell.\n\nIt’s like peeling an onion, gradually revealing each layer beneath the surface.\nTo achieve this, you need to have X-ray measurements along every line passing through the region of interest.\nFor each X-ray, you want to record the line integral—the total attenuation along that path.\nThis situation pertains to 2D image reconstruction.\n\nAlways keep in mind the principle of unimpeded data acquisition.\nWe say there must be at least one point on the X-ray source trajectory for every line passing through the object.\nIn other words, you need a measured projection corresponding to every line through the cross-section.\nThis ensures you have complete data for accurate reconstruction.\n\n\n.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"X-ray projection data\", \"category\": \"reconstruction\"},\n    {\"term\": \"line integral\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"2D image reconstruction\", \"category\": \"reconstruction\"},\n    {\"term\": \"unimpeded data acquisition\", \"category\": \"physics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"X-ray source trajectory\", \"category\": \"physics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"measured projection\", \"category\": \"data_processing\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"As we discussed in the previous lecture, when you collect X-ray projection data from an unimpeded perspective, you aim to reconstruct the image layer by layer, starting from the outermost shell.\", \"To achieve this, you need to have X-ray measurements along every line passing through the region of interest.\", \"For each X-ray, you want to record the line integral—the total attenuation along that path.\", \"This situation pertains to 2D image reconstruction.\", \"Always keep in mind the principle of unimpeded data acquisition.\", \"We say there must be at least one point on the X-ray source trajectory for every line passing through the object.\", \"In other words, you need a measured",
