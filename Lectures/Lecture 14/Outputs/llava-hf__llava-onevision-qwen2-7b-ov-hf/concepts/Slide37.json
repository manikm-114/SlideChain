From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLow contrast image resolution can be measured using resolution phantoms containing small test objects with subtle differences in density. These phantoms help to assess if the scanner and reconstruction algorithm can visualize objects with minor contrast differences.\n\nWhen contrast is poor, like between blood vessels and surrounding tissue, contrast agents such as iodine are injected. These agents highlight the vessels, making blood, tumors, and related structures more visible.\n\nThis approach significantly improves low-contrast resolution, enabling better diagnosis and visualization of soft tissues.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"contrast agent\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"contrast resolution\", \"category\": \"quality_metric\"},\n    {\"term\": \"contrast enhancement\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"contrast agent injection\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"contrast resolution improvement\", \"category\": \"quality_metric\"},\n    {\"term\": \"contrast resolution assessment\", \"category\": \"quality_metric\"},\n    {\"term\": \"contrast resolution phantoms\", \"category\": \"instrumentation\"},\n    {\"term\": \"contrast resolution measurement\", \"category\": \"quality_metric\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"SLIDE_TEXT\"]\n}\n```",
