From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nScattering artifacts occur due to scattered X-ray photons. Let me explain this with an example. Imagine sending an X-ray beam from the south direction through the body. Follow my cursor as I illustrate. The primary X-ray beam travels straight through a data element, creating the expected line integral for reconstruction.\n\nHowever, during measurement, some X-rays scatter in various directions. You might see scattering toward the right, left, or even backward directions. These scattered photons add a background signal that does not correspond to the direct transmission along the beam path.\nBecause of this scattered radiation, the detector picks up additional signals on top of the real primary X-rays. This extra background leads to artifacts in the image—usually appearing as low-frequency streaking or haze that reduces contrast and clarity.\nIf you correct for scattering components by estimating and subtracting them, you can restore the image quality close to the phantom reconstruction without scatter.\n\nOne common method to reduce scatter is using beam blockers placed strategically. These beam blockers function to block certain parts of the primary radiation, allowing measurement of scatter separately and improved image correction.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
