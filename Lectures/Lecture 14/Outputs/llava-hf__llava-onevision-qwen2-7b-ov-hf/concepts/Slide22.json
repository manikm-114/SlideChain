From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nIt then took over a decade for the field to develop what is called the exact helical cone beam algorithm. This algorithm still uses the filtered backprojection framework but is mathematically exact.\n\nThe author, Dr. Katsevich, is a mathematician, so the paper is quite dense and challenging for most engineering students. Nonetheless, it demonstrates that modern CT theory can effectively handle longitudinally truncated data.\n\nEarlier, I mentioned that in the second generation, data truncation happens transversely, while helical CT mainly deals with longitudinal data truncation, which can be seen as a symmetric problem.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
