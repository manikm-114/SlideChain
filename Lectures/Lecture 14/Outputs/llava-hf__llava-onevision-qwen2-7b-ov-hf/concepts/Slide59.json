From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, let's talk about the last slide and some course housekeeping.\nThese three questions in the green book are quite typical and not very difficult.\nRegarding homework, you have one week—seven working days—to complete it.\n\n\nOn the other hand, for a bit of fun and creativity, you can try designing a futuristic portable CT scanner in an autonomous vehicle—think of it like something fancy and innovative.\n\nI believe future technology will enable very affordable, fully reconfigurable CT scanners.\nImagine robotic X-ray detectors integrated into cars—if you want a screening, you just call like ordering an Uber.\nThe robotic scanner arrives at your home, performs the scan, and you get your results without leaving the house.\nI think that will be incredibly cool and transformative.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"CT scanner\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"autonomous vehicle\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"futuristic\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"portable\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"reconfigurable\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"X-ray detectors\", \"category\": \"instrumentation\"},\n    {\"term\": \"Uber\", \"category\": \"communication\"},\n    {\"term\": \"screening\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"results\", \"category\": \"communication\"},\n    {\"term\": \"affordable\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"fully reconfigurable\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"robotic\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"scanners\", \"category\": \"instrumentation\"},\n    {\"term\": \"perform\", \"category\": \"workflow\"},\n    {\"term\": \"scan\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"get\", \"category\": \"communication\"},\n    {\"term\": \"without leaving\", \"category\": \"communication\"},",
