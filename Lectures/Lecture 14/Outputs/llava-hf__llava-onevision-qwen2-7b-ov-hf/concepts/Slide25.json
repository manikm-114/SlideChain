From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet me add some comparison between classic CT and interior tomography.\n\nAccording to classical theory, which we learned and which I explained in textbooks, you need to collect all data to satisfy the data sufficiency condition—usually a fan beam or cone beam that covers the entire cross-section or object.\nThe data must comprehensively cover the object for accurate reconstruction.\nInterior tomography, however, only requires partial data limited to the region of interest.\n\nThus, with filtered backprojection, classic CT reconstructs a global image, like a wholesale business covering the entire area.\nInterior tomography reconstructs a smaller, targeted area—like retail shopping.\nThis opens up new opportunities, providing flexibility and precision.\nYou only need to shoot X-rays through the important region, reducing dose and focusing on clinical needs.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"classical theory\", \"category\": \"physics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"data sufficiency condition\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"fan beam or cone beam\", \"category\": \"physics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"reconstruction\", \"category\": \"reconstruction\"},\n    {\"term\": \"filtered backprojection\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"global image\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"targeted area\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"retail shopping\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"flexibility and precision\", \"category\": \"workflow\"},\n    {\"term\": \"X-rays\", \"category\": \"physics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"reducing dose\", \"category\": \"quality_metric\"},\n    {\"term\": \"clinical needs\", \"category\": \"modality\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"According to classical theory, which we learned and which I explained in textbooks, you need to collect all data to satisfy the data sufficiency condition—usually a fan beam or cone beam that covers the entire cross-section or object.\", \"The data must",
