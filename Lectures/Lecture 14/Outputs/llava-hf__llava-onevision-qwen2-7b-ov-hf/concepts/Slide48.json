  "raw_output": "user \nSystem:\nYou are an expert educator in medical imaging. From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nBefore we dive deeper, let me give you a natural reference to help put radiation dose levels in perspective.\nIf you live in India, you receive an annual natural radiation dose of over 10 millisieverts—or 10 million microsieverts—which comes from natural sources like soil and cosmic rays.\n\nIn China, the natural background radiation exposure is roughly half that of India.\nIf you are concerned that radiation is harmful, then living in Toronto would be better, as the natural background radiation there is lower.\nIn the United States, the average natural background radiation dose is about three millisieverts per year.\n\nThese background levels are unavoidable since radiation comes from natural sources in the environment.\nUnderstanding these reference levels helps put medical radiation doses into context.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"millisievert\", \"category\": \"physics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"microsievert\", \"category\": \"physics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"natural radiation dose\", \"category\": \"physics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"India\", \"category\": \"anatomy\"},\n    {\"term\": \"China\", \"category\": \"anatomy\"},\n    {\"term\": \"Toronto\", \"category\": \"anatomy\"},\n    {\"term\": \"United States\", \"category\": \"anatomy\"},\n    {\"term\": \"natural background radiation\", \"category\": \"physics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"background levels\", \"category\": \"physics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"medical radiation doses\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"context\", \"category\": \"communication\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"If you live in India, you receive an annual natural radiation dose of over 10 millisieverts—or 10 million microsieverts—which comes from natural sources like soil and cosmic rays.\", \n             \"In China, the natural background radiation exposure is roughly half that of India.\",\n             \"If you are concerned that radiation is harmful, then living in Toronto would be better,",
