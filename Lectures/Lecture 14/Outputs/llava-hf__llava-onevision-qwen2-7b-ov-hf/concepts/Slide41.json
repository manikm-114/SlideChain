From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThis is an example of CT images affected by beam hardening without any correction. You can see a darker strip in the image, which obscures details. After applying correction techniques, you can visualize structures like gray matter much more clearly.\n\nBeam hardening artifacts originate from the X-ray source and the polychromatic nature of the X-ray beam. When you use a photon-counting detector, it can measure X-ray signals at different energy levels separately.\n\nBy distinguishing between energies, photon-counting detectors effectively eliminate beam hardening artifacts. This technology significantly improves image quality by reducing these artifacts that cause distortions in conventional CT images.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
