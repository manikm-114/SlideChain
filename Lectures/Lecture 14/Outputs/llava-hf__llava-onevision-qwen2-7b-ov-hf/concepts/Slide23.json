From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThere is also an interesting transverse data truncation problem.\nImagine your cross-section represents the green base, while the blue area is a smaller region of interest, or ROI.\nPerhaps you’re only interested in the heart, or in the ear if planning a cochlear implant.\n\nIn this case, the ROI is small. You might use a narrow fan beam targeted only through the ROI, then rotate as in third-generation fan beam geometry. This means the projection data is transversely truncated on both sides.\nWith truncation on both edges, the Fourier slice theorem no longer applies, making reconstruction very challenging.\nMathematically, this “interior problem” has no unique solution, meaning multiple structures could produce identical data, and you wouldn’t know which is correct.\n\nSeveral years ago, my group revisited and solved this problem, which we felt very proud of.\nWhile the classical interior problem’s non-uniqueness holds in unrestricted function spaces, we showed that introducing prior knowledge allows exact reconstruction. \n\nFor example, if you know a small sub-region of the ROI, such as air in the airway or blood in the aorta, you can use that known X-ray attenuation coefficient as a reference. This prior information enables theoretical, exact reconstruction within the ROI from truncated data, a method called interior tomography. Our work was well received, although reviewers raised important questions.\n\nOne student tested whether blood density varies among different races or sexes, finding it consistent across populations.\nThis allowed us to use blood density as a stable reference in cardiac imaging, so you only need to scan the heart, reducing radiation dose.\nLater, reviewers pointed out that contrast agents—like iodine injected during CT angiography—change blood density, so you can’t always rely on a fixed reference.\nThis challenge led us to develop a new solution.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
