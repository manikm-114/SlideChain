From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAs you can see, the topic of this lecture is called CT scanner.\u000bNext time, we will have a MATLAB session.\u000bDuring that, we’ll talk about filtered backprojection and related concepts.\u000bYou’ll have the opportunity to review MATLAB commands and functions so you can perform filtered back projection.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"CT scanner\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"MATLAB\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"filtered backprojection\", \"category\": \"reconstruction\"},\n    {\"term\": \"MATLAB commands and functions\", \"category\": \"software\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"As you can see, the topic of this lecture is called CT scanner.\", \n               \"Next time, we will have a MATLAB session.\", \n               \"During that, we’ll talk about filtered backprojection and related concepts.\", \n               \"You’ll have the opportunity to review MATLAB commands and functions so you can perform filtered back projection.\"]\n}\n```",
