From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, let's talk about the CT dose index, or CTDI.\n\nSuppose the slice thickness is represented by T.\nYou integrate the radiation dose measurements over the slice thickness, effectively summing the dose contributions from the slice and imaginary adjacent slices—say, seven slices above and seven slices below.\nAll these doses are added together, and the total is then averaged by normalizing with the slice thickness T.\nThis result is what we call the CT dose index, or CTDI.\n\nIt's a simple yet important concept, as it includes any additional leakage radiation in the dose computation.\nThe CTDI provides a standardized measure of radiation output from the CT scanner, reflecting dose distribution within the irradiated volume.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"CTDoseIndex\", \"category\": \"physics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"CTDoseIndex\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"CTDoseIndex\", \"category\": \"quality_metric\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"It's a simple yet important concept, as it includes any additional leakage radiation in the dose computation.\"]\n}\n```",
