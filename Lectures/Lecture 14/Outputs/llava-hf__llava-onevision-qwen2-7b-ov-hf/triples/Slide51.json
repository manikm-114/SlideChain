Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, let me explain the concept of the radiation dose profile, sometimes called the releasing profile.\n\nImagine you perform a circular CT scan. This scanning method reconstructs images within a single plane, called the XY plane.\nIdeally, the X-ray beam would be finely collimated so that all photons are confined within the slice thickness, represented as a neat rectangular region—say, highlighted in yellow.\n\nHowever, in reality, the system is not perfect.\nYou have scattered photons, and the emission is not perfectly confined.\nTherefore, the actual radiation dose profile follows a curve, often shown as a blue curve.\nThis means that, even though you intend to irradiate only the slice thickness, some dose extends beyond this region.\nThis dose \"tail\" outside the intended slice area also contributes to the total patient radiation exposure.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"radiation dose profile\", \"p\":\"represents\",\n     \"o\":\"blue curve\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"This dose 'tail' outside the intended slice area also contributes to the total patient radiation exposure.\"}\n  ]\n}",
