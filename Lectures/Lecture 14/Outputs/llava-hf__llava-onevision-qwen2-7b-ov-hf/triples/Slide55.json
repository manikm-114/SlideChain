Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nTo measure radiation dose, we use specialized instruments called dosimeters.\nI personally had the opportunity to work on radiation dose measurements for CT scanners during my time at Washington University School of Medicine.\n\nIt was engaging and valuable research work, and I frequently used dosimetry equipment to evaluate radiation output.\nThese dosimeters help assess the radiation delivered by the scanner, ensuring safety and proper calibration.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1].
