Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHelical or spiral CT began with single-slice scanning using a linear detector array, capturing rays in two dimensions.\nExpanding this, cone beam helical spiral CT was developed. For cone beam spiral CT, the issue of data truncation is addressed more intricately.\nIf you slice through the patient in any plane, the actual X-ray beam forms a fan beam in that plane.\n\nThis fan beam is longitudinally truncated because the patient’s body is quite long, and the detector size limits the coverage. You cannot cover the whole body with a single cone beam at once.\n\nOften, you focus on smaller regions of interest like the heart or inner ear, so using a huge cone beam isn’t practical.\nConsequently, data truncation naturally occurs in helical cone beam scanning, making it an important consideration in advanced CT imaging.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"helical or spiral CT\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"single-slice scanning using a linear detector array\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"capturing rays in two dimensions\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
