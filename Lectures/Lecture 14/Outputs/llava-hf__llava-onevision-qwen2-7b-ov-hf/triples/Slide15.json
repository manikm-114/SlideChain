Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nWe analyzed helical CT scanning modes further. Traditional step-and-shoot CT uses multiple circular scans. For each scan, you reconstruct one CT slice, repeating many times for full coverage.\nIn helical CT, instead of discrete circular scans, you have one continuous helical acquisition. For each helical rotation, interpolation creates synthetic data points.\n\nYou can reconstruct images at many arbitrary longitudinal positions along the patient, generating a large number of slices computationally. This technique is called retrospective reconstruction.\nRetrospective reconstruction has a significant clinical advantage. For example, in tumor detection, a lesion may fall between two slices in traditional scanning and go undetected.\n\nWith retrospective reconstruction, densely sampled slices mean one slice will include the tumor, improving detection confidence and diagnostic accuracy.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"helical CT scanning\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"multiple circular scans\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"Traditional step-and-shoot CT uses multiple circular scans.\"}\n  ]\n}",
