Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, let's talk about the last slide and some course housekeeping.\nThese three questions in the green book are quite typical and not very difficult.\nRegarding homework, you have one week—seven working days—to complete it.\n\n\nOn the other hand, for a bit of fun and creativity, you can try designing a futuristic portable CT scanner in an autonomous vehicle—think of it like something fancy and innovative.\n\nI believe future technology will enable very affordable, fully reconfigurable CT scanners.\nImagine robotic X-ray detectors integrated into cars—if you want a screening, you just call like ordering an Uber.\nThe robotic scanner arrives at your home, performs the scan, and you get your results without leaving the house.\nI think that will be incredibly cool and transformative.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"CT scanner\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"autonomous vehicle\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"You can try designing a futuristic portable CT scanner in an autonomous vehicle—think of it like something fancy and innovative.\"}\n  ]\n}",
