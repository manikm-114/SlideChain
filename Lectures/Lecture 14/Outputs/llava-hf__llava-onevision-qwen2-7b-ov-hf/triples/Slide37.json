Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLow contrast image resolution can be measured using resolution phantoms containing small test objects with subtle differences in density. These phantoms help to assess if the scanner and reconstruction algorithm can visualize objects with minor contrast differences.\n\nWhen contrast is poor, like between blood vessels and surrounding tissue, contrast agents such as iodine are injected. These agents highlight the vessels, making blood, tumors, and related structures more visible.\n\nThis approach significantly improves low-contrast resolution, enabling better diagnosis and visualization of soft tissues.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"contrast agent\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"contrast resolution\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"Contrast agents such as iodine are injected to highlight blood vessels, tumors, and related structures.\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
