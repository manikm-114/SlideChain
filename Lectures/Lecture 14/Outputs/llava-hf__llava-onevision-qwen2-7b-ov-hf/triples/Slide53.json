Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAnother way to think about radiation dose is through the dose profile measured over multiple circular scans.\n\nWhen you perform one circular scan, you get a certain dose distribution.\nIf you then do a second circular scan, you’ll get a similar dose profile again.\nWhen multiple scans are performed, each scan adds its own dose profile.\n\nThese multiple dose profiles overlap, contributing to the total radiation dose the patient receives.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1].
