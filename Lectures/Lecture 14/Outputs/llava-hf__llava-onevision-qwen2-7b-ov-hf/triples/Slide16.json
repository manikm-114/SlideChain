Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNext, we have partial volume averaging artifacts. For each slice, if a tumor only partially lies within that slice, you might not see it clearly. Small tumors can be especially difficult to detect when they occupy only half of a slice, and image noise further complicates clear visualization.\n\nHowever, with spiral CT, you can select longitudinal positions as densely as you want. This gives you a real opportunity to reconstruct images densely enough. One of the reconstructed slices is likely to contain the tumor fully, providing much better contrast resolution and visibility.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"partial volume averaging artifacts\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"tumor\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"For each slice, if a tumor only partially lies within that slice, you might not see it clearly.
