Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAt RPI, we have collaborated with GE Global Research Center and with Bruno Diem and others to develop optimized architectures for dedicated cardiac CT scanners.\n\nWe published a paper last year on this topic.\nDesigning a CT scanner is much like designing a building or room—you consider architecture and optimal layout.\nOur team is currently preparing a grant proposal to advance this research. The proposal is due soon and covers aspects not addressed in previous reviews.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"GE Global Research Center\", \"p\":\"collaborated|with\", \"o\":\"RPI\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"We have collaborated with GE Global Research Center and with Bruno Diem and others to develop optimized architectures for dedicated cardiac CT scanners.\"}\n  ]\n}",
