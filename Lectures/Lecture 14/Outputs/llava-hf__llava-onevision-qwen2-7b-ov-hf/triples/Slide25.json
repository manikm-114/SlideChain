Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet me add some comparison between classic CT and interior tomography.\n\nAccording to classical theory, which we learned and which I explained in textbooks, you need to collect all data to satisfy the data sufficiency condition—usually a fan beam or cone beam that covers the entire cross-section or object.\nThe data must comprehensively cover the object for accurate reconstruction.\nInterior tomography, however, only requires partial data limited to the region of interest.\n\nThus, with filtered backprojection, classic CT reconstructs a global image, like a wholesale business covering the entire area.\nInterior tomography reconstructs a smaller, targeted area—like retail shopping.\nThis opens up new opportunities, providing flexibility and precision.\nYou only need to shoot X-rays through the important region, reducing dose and focusing on clinical needs.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1].
