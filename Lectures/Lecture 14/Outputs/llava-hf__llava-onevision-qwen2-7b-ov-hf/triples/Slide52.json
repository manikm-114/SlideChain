Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, let's talk about the CT dose index, or CTDI.\n\nSuppose the slice thickness is represented by T.\nYou integrate the radiation dose measurements over the slice thickness, effectively summing the dose contributions from the slice and imaginary adjacent slices—say, seven slices above and seven slices below.\nAll these doses are added together, and the total is then averaged by normalizing with the slice thickness T.\nThis result is what we call the CT dose index, or CTDI.\n\nIt's a simple yet important concept, as it includes any additional leakage radiation in the dose computation.\nThe CTDI provides a standardized measure of radiation output from the CT scanner, reflecting dose distribution within the irradiated volume.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"CTDoseIndex\", \"p\":\"measures\",\n     \"o\":\"RadiationDose\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":1.0, \"evidence\":\"The CTDI provides a standardized measure of radiation output from the CT scanner, reflecting dose distribution within the irradiated volume.\"}\n  ]\n}",
