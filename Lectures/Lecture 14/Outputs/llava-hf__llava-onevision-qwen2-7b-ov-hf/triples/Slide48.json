Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nBefore we dive deeper, let me give you a natural reference to help put radiation dose levels in perspective.\nIf you live in India, you receive an annual natural radiation dose of over 10 millisieverts—or 10 million microsieverts—which comes from natural sources like soil and cosmic rays.\n\nIn China, the natural background radiation exposure is roughly half that of India.\nIf you are concerned that radiation is harmful, then living in Toronto would be better, as the natural background radiation there is lower.\nIn the United States, the average natural background radiation dose is about three millisieverts per year.\n\nThese background levels are unavoidable since radiation comes from natural sources in the environment.\nUnderstanding these reference levels helps put medical radiation doses into context.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"India\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"millisieverts\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"You receive an annual natural radiation dose of over 10 millisieverts—or 10 million microsieverts—which comes from natural sources like soil and cosmic rays.\"}\n  ]\n}",
