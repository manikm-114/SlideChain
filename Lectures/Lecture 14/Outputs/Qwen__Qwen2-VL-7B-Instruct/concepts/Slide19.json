From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nIn the early 1990s, I wrote a paper called the General Cone Beam Reconstruction Algorithm. \n\nIt explains that for cone beam helical scanning—where the beam geometry is divergent—you cannot simply apply linear interpolation to reconstruct images.\n\nThe mathematics involved is more complicated, requiring specialized algorithms to handle data truncation and beam geometry correctly.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
