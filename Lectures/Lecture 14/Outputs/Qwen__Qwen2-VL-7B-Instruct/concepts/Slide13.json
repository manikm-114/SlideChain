From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nWith helical scanning, when you want to reconstruct an XY cross-section, ideally, you’d have rays confined entirely within the XY plane. But the actual green helical scanning path deviates from this ideal.\n\nYou measure line integrals only along rays that coincide with this helical path. Immediately, the X-ray source moves out of the plane, producing rays above and below it. To reconstruct a cross-section, say in the XY plane, you need every line integral through this section, including along particular rays such as Ray A.\n\nIn practice, you can’t measure the line integral exactly along Ray A because the source never stays on that plane long enough. You only have rays above and below it. That’s the central data truncation problem in helical CT.\nEngineers found a practical solution. Helical scanning benefits from continuous table motion without stops or accelerations. The patient lies flat on the table, which moves steadily through the scanner. The patient simply stays still until done, making the process fast and smooth.\nTo compensate for missing data, we perform linear interpolation between the upper and lower rays, which are available. The assumption is that the data varies roughly linearly between these rays. This allows synthesis of an in-plane data set, which then can be used with filtered back-projection algorithms. This was the first trial approach.\n\nLater improvements involved helical scanning which uses opposite rays, not just the nearest rays in the same direction. Before reaching a certain position, you could use complementary rays shot from an opposite angle to improve interpolation.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
