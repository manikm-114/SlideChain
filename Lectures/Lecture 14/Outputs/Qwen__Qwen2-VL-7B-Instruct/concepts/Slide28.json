From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet me show you a typical CT scanner layout. You have the X-ray tube, which is quite heavy—for example, our lab’s donated GE tube is heavy.\nPowering the tube requires a high-voltage supply and a cooling system; scanning consumes energy and heats the tube.\nCooling is done with water or air to keep components at safe operating temperatures.\nThis entire setup is called the gantry. It includes the patient table where the patient lies, the detector array opposite the source, and collimators in front of the detectors.\n\nIn conventional CT, the source, detectors, and associated hardware are mounted on the rotating gantry.\nDuring scanning, the gantry physically rotates, typically half or a full circle, then reverses direction. This back-and-forth rotation is limited by cabling, which can tangle with repeated turns.\n\nFor helical scanning, slip ring technology is employed. The slip ring lets you rotate continuously without cables twisting or breaking.\nIt consists of rings with carefully designed contacts to transmit power to the X-ray source and data from the detectors.\nSlip ring technology is critical for continuous and fast scanning. It enables the transfer of data to the scanner’s computer or local storage during rotation.\nWhen designing a CT scanner, the goal is faster and faster imaging speed, with the most demanding application being cardiac imaging—the holy grail of CT.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
