From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, let me give you some comparisons to help you understand radiation doses better.\nFor example, a chest X-ray typically delivers a radiation dose of about 0.1 millisieverts.\nA whole-body CT scan, on the other hand, can deliver around 10 millisieverts.\nResearchers and medical professionals are working hard to reduce these doses.\n\nOur goal is to bring CT radiation doses down to about one millisievert or less per scan, which would be considered comparatively safe.\nTo put this in perspective, in your everyday life, you naturally receive about two millisieverts of radiation annually from environmental sources.\nSo, when you receive a CT scan with a dose around one millisievert, that’s roughly half of your average yearly natural exposure.\nYou can think of it like visiting a high natural radiation area, such as parts of India or other regions, where you might be exposed to somewhat higher background radiation if you stay longer.\n\nThere are other units you might encounter, such as M-R or similar, but the gray and sievert (or millisievert) remain the standard units for expressing radiation dose. This comparison helps warm you up and offers a bit of perspective on how these numbers relate to everyday life.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
