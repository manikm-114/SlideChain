From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNext, we have electron beam CT, which uses a different approach. Instead of a mechanical X-ray tube rotation like earlier generations, this system uses an electron beam that’s electromagnetically steered to hit a fixed target shaped as multiple metallic arcs.\nEach arc produces X-rays upward, forming the scanning beam. The electron beam is steered by electromagnetic fields very rapidly without moving parts mechanically. This allows for much faster imaging speeds.\n\nThe driving force behind the evolution of scanning generations is increasing data acquisition efficiency: collecting the same amount of data in a shorter time to improve temporal resolution.\nCardiac imaging is the most challenging application for CT, since the heart beats fast, anywhere between 60 and 100 beats per minute. Tomographic reconstruction assumes the object is stationary, but the heart is constantly moving. So, we need to shorten the data acquisition time drastically.\n\nThe electron beam CT scanner was designed specifically for cardiac imaging due to its high speed. However, it is costly, and image noise is often higher. Additionally, the fourth-generation geometry faces problems with scattered signals affecting other detectors, which causes degradation in image quality.\nBecause of these limitations, the third-generation geometry remains more widely used today, and electron beam CT scanners are now mostly considered outdated.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
