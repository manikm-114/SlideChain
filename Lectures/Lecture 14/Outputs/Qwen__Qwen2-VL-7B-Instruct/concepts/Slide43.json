From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNext, we have what are called metal artifacts. Inside the human body, you may have metal implants like pacemakers or dental fillings. Metal is much denser than bone, so it can block X-rays effectively.\nBecause of this, X-rays cannot penetrate metal implants well. The attenuated signal behind the metal may be very noisy or even just noise without a clear signal.\n\nWhen you perform filtered backprojection reconstruction in such cases, the results are often poor, showing streaking artifacts.\nThis happens because the line integral passing through the metal is very long, with many photons blocked or scattered. Beam hardening and other effects further degrade the signal.\nAs a result, the detected signals are compromised with a low signal-to-noise ratio. When estimating line integrals, the data is inconsistent and inaccurate.\n\nFiltered backprojection on such corrupted data generates stripe-like artifacts in the images, which is a typical manifestation of metal artifacts in CT.\nReducing metal artifacts is an important research topic, and multiple algorithms have been developed, though it remains challenging.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
