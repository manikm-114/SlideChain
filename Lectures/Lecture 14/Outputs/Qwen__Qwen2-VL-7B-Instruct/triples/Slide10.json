Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nDefining CT scanning modes, or how many generations to count, varies depending on the source. Different textbooks categorize them differently. Usually, the first three generations are well established: the first generation, the second generation, and the third generation.\n\nHowever, beyond these, the classification becomes a matter of opinion and varies by source.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
