Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo, let’s look at the outline for today’s lecture.\n\nFirst, we’ll talk about projection data truncation—the issue when the X-ray projections don’t fully cover the object, which can cause artifacts.\n\nNext, we’ll discuss different scanning modes used in CT technology.\n\nThen, we will move on to common image artifacts that can degrade image quality.\n\nFinally, we’ll cover X-ray radiation dose, which is important because it can be harmful to patients if not properly managed.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"projection data truncation\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"artifacts\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"projection data truncation—the issue when the X-ray projections don’t fully cover the object, which can cause artifacts.\"}\n  ]\n}",
