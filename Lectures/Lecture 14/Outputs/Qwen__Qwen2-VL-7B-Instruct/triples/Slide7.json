Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThis leads us to the issue of data truncation. If the data is incomplete, the Fourier slice theorem— which assumes a full projection profile for each one-dimensional Fourier transform—can no longer be applied straightforwardly.\n\nWhat happens if part of the data is missing? If some portion of the projection profile is lost, the Fourier transformation cannot be performed fully. This is called the data truncation problem. Much of modern CT theory has been developed to address this data truncation problem, finding ways to reconstruct images even with incomplete data.\n\nBefore we delve into the types of data truncation, let me give you some context.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"data truncation\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\", \"o\":\"Fourier slice theorem\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"If the data is incomplete, the Fourier slice theorem— which assumes a full projection profile for each one-dimensional Fourier transform—can no longer be applied straightforwardly.\"}\n  ]\n}",
