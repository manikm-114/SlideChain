Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThis is an example of CT images affected by beam hardening without any correction. You can see a darker strip in the image, which obscures details. After applying correction techniques, you can visualize structures like gray matter much more clearly.\n\nBeam hardening artifacts originate from the X-ray source and the polychromatic nature of the X-ray beam. When you use a photon-counting detector, it can measure X-ray signals at different energy levels separately.\n\nBy distinguishing between energies, photon-counting detectors effectively eliminate beam hardening artifacts. This technology significantly improves image quality by reducing these artifacts that cause distortions in conventional CT images.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"CT images\", \"p\":\"uses\", \"o\":\"beam hardening artifacts\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"This is an example of CT images affected by beam hardening without any correction.
