Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAs we discussed in the previous lecture, when you collect X-ray projection data from an unimpeded perspective, you aim to reconstruct the image layer by layer, starting from the outermost shell.\n\nIt’s like peeling an onion, gradually revealing each layer beneath the surface.\nTo achieve this, you need to have X-ray measurements along every line passing through the region of interest.\nFor each X-ray, you want to record the line integral—the total attenuation along that path.\nThis situation pertains to 2D image reconstruction.\n\nAlways keep in mind the principle of unimpeded data acquisition.\nWe say there must be at least one point on the X-ray source trajectory for every line passing through the object.\nIn other words, you need a measured projection corresponding to every line through the cross-section.\nThis ensures you have complete data for accurate reconstruction.\n\n\n.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"X-ray measurements\", \"p\":\"measures\", \"o\":\"line integral\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":1.0, \"evidence\":\"To achieve this, you need to have X-ray measurements along every line passing through the region of interest.
