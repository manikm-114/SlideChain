Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nIt then took over a decade for the field to develop what is called the exact helical cone beam algorithm. This algorithm still uses the filtered backprojection framework but is mathematically exact.\n\nThe author, Dr. Katsevich, is a mathematician, so the paper is quite dense and challenging for most engineering students. Nonetheless, it demonstrates that modern CT theory can effectively handle longitudinally truncated data.\n\nEarlier, I mentioned that in the second generation, data truncation happens transversely, while helical CT mainly deals with longitudinal data truncation, which can be seen as a symmetric problem.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"Exact Spiral Cone-beam CT\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"filtered backprojection framework\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"It then took over a decade for the field to develop what is called the exact helical cone beam algorithm.
