Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nI have given multiple presentations on interior tomography. One key idea is that interior tomography uses less data—less is more in many ways. Less data means a deeper understanding of imaging principles. We can handle larger objects, use less radiation dose, and achieve faster scanning.\n\nWhy is it faster? All scanning geometries, from first to helical generations, aim to speed up scanning. A cone beam is better than a fan beam because it allows parallel data acquisition. Interior tomography takes this even further by enabling higher-level parallelism with multiple X-ray sources and smaller detector arrays.\n\nIn the extreme, you could have many X-ray focal spots, possibly based on emerging technologies like carbon nanotube cold emission X-ray sources. These enable distributed X-ray cells with small detector elements arranged similarly to the fourth-generation geometry.\nAt any instant, such a system could collect multiple truncated projections. Handling data truncation like this allows reconstruction focused on small regions of interest, achieving the fastest possible tomographic imaging speed. You cannot go faster than the speed of light, which governs X-ray photon travel.\n\nWe filed for intellectual property on this concept at Virginia Tech. Later, I will discuss the potential of interior tomography in cardiac imaging.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
