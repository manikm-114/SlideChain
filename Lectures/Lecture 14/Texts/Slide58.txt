We have discussed various technologies to reduce radiation dose in CT scanning, including interior tomography and photon counting detectors.

Additionally, iterative reconstruction algorithms play a key role. Unlike traditional analytic algorithms, which do not account for image noise or statistical fluctuations, iterative methods model these factors explicitly.
By doing so, they improve image quality while allowing dose reduction.
Those represent technological approaches to lowering patient radiation exposure.

Now, I’d like to share something not in the slides—a more biological approach.
Ionizing radiation causes real damage through DNA breaks and other effects.
Some medications or natural products contain antioxidants, which can help mitigate radiation-induced damage.
For example, orange juice and blueberries contain antioxidants.
If you search the literature, you’ll find several studies suggesting that antioxidants may have protective effects against radiation damage.
While this is not part of any clinical protocol, and doctors don’t routinely prescribe antioxidants before CT scans, I personally believe in their potential benefit.

Next time I have a CT scan, I plan to drink two bottles of orange juice an hour beforehand.
If you find this interesting, you might want to do your own research and consider consuming antioxidants before imaging.
One of my students is setting up experiments to scientifically evaluate the protective effect of antioxidants, like orange juice, against radiation damage during CT scans.

This is an exciting area of ongoing research, and we hope to quantify the benefits more precisely in the future.
