Another way to think about radiation dose is through the dose profile measured over multiple circular scans.

When you perform one circular scan, you get a certain dose distribution.
If you then do a second circular scan, you’ll get a similar dose profile again.
When multiple scans are performed, each scan adds its own dose profile.

These multiple dose profiles overlap, contributing to the total radiation dose the patient receives.
