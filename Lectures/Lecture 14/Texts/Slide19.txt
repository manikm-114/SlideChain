In the early 1990s, I wrote a paper called the General Cone Beam Reconstruction Algorithm. 

It explains that for cone beam helical scanning—where the beam geometry is divergent—you cannot simply apply linear interpolation to reconstruct images.

The mathematics involved is more complicated, requiring specialized algorithms to handle data truncation and beam geometry correctly.
