Next, we have what are called metal artifacts. Inside the human body, you may have metal implants like pacemakers or dental fillings. Metal is much denser than bone, so it can block X-rays effectively.
Because of this, X-rays cannot penetrate metal implants well. The attenuated signal behind the metal may be very noisy or even just noise without a clear signal.

When you perform filtered backprojection reconstruction in such cases, the results are often poor, showing streaking artifacts.
This happens because the line integral passing through the metal is very long, with many photons blocked or scattered. Beam hardening and other effects further degrade the signal.
As a result, the detected signals are compromised with a low signal-to-noise ratio. When estimating line integrals, the data is inconsistent and inaccurate.

Filtered backprojection on such corrupted data generates stripe-like artifacts in the images, which is a typical manifestation of metal artifacts in CT.
Reducing metal artifacts is an important research topic, and multiple algorithms have been developed, though it remains challenging.
