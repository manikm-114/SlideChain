This is an example of CT images affected by beam hardening without any correction. You can see a darker strip in the image, which obscures details. After applying correction techniques, you can visualize structures like gray matter much more clearly.

Beam hardening artifacts originate from the X-ray source and the polychromatic nature of the X-ray beam. When you use a photon-counting detector, it can measure X-ray signals at different energy levels separately.

By distinguishing between energies, photon-counting detectors effectively eliminate beam hardening artifacts. This technology significantly improves image quality by reducing these artifacts that cause distortions in conventional CT images.
