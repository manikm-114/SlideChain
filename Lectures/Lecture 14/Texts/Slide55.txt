To measure radiation dose, we use specialized instruments called dosimeters.
I personally had the opportunity to work on radiation dose measurements for CT scanners during my time at Washington University School of Medicine.

It was engaging and valuable research work, and I frequently used dosimetry equipment to evaluate radiation output.
These dosimeters help assess the radiation delivered by the scanner, ensuring safety and proper calibration.
