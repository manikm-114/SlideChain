Using opposite rays that are closer to ray A reduces the distance between the measured and estimated line integrals. The narrower this gap, the better the accuracy you can expect.

This “half-scan” interpolation enhances longitudinal resolution along the Z-axis compared to linear interpolation. Longitudinal resolution along the Z direction is often lower than in-plane resolution.
Back when I just graduated and started work at Washington University Medical School in St. Louis, helical CT was introduced. Radiologists appreciated the improved temporal resolution it offered.

However, they noticed motion blurring along the Z-axis caused by the interpolation process. Since the patient is continuously moved through the scanner, motion blur appears in the longitudinal direction, similar to a photo taken while running.

As they say, there’s no free lunch—you gain temporal resolution but lose some longitudinal resolution due to motion blur.
