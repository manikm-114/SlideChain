Next, we have partial volume averaging artifacts. For each slice, if a tumor only partially lies within that slice, you might not see it clearly. Small tumors can be especially difficult to detect when they occupy only half of a slice, and image noise further complicates clear visualization.

However, with spiral CT, you can select longitudinal positions as densely as you want. This gives you a real opportunity to reconstruct images densely enough. One of the reconstructed slices is likely to contain the tumor fully, providing much better contrast resolution and visibility.
