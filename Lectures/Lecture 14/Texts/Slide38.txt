Temporal resolution, so you see conventional CP scanning. You do one slice at a time. Then you
move the patient into the country by a small increment. Do again, patient, keep pressing. 

So from slice to slice, you see some discontinuity. So this is not due to some pathological feature.
It's really due to motion artifacts that show the temporal resolution agent is good enough. But
With helical scanning, it's smoothed out, but you have some longitudinal blurring.

Here is the earlier algorithm. Later, I mentioned overlapping reconstruction. You really can
recover an image longitudinally and a better resolution than conventional scanning. Anyway,
so we wouldn't have time to go into details.
