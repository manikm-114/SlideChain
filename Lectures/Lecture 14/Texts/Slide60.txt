Several years ago, we undertook an innovative project and received some news coverage about it.

We built a CT scanner that does not rotate the gantry as in conventional designs.
Instead, the patient lies on a rotating table—literally a sheet that turns—while the X-ray tube and detector remain fixed in place.
The gantry is simplified to just a tube and a detector, with no mechanical rotation during imaging.
We then perform the translation of the table and the scanning components.

Although this setup limits the viewing angle compared to traditional systems, it still produces good-quality images.
If you like, you can think creatively or artistically about how this concept could be extended to robotic scanners deployed in autonomous vehicles or portable scanners for versatile use.

This is all just for fun and imagination.
That’s all for today.
Thank you for your attention.
