Let me share with you some typical radiation dose values.
For example, in a breast exam, the physical energy absorbed is measured in grays. But when you take biological sensitivity into account and use standard formulas, the unit becomes the sievert, often abbreviated as Sv or sometimes called C-word.

To clarify, grays measure the pure physical energy deposited, while sieverts factor in biological effects, making them more meaningful for assessing health risk.
Because a sievert—or the C-word—is a relatively large unit, radiation dose is often expressed in millisieverts (mSv).
For a typical breast examination, the effective dose is quite low.
For high-dose CT scans, the effective dose can be in the range of three millisieverts.
For a full-body CT scan, it could be around ten millisieverts.
These values give you an idea of the radiation dose magnitude.

In CT scanning, another important metric is the CT Dose Index, or CTDI, which is used to estimate how much radiation dose is delivered.
CTDI is not organ-specific; it measures the average dose over one full rotation of the scanner around the patient, providing a rough estimate of radiation exposure.
Later, I will show you a figure to illustrate this concept visually.
