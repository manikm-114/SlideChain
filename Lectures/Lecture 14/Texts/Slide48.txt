Before we dive deeper, let me give you a natural reference to help put radiation dose levels in perspective.
If you live in India, you receive an annual natural radiation dose of over 10 millisieverts—or 10 million microsieverts—which comes from natural sources like soil and cosmic rays.

In China, the natural background radiation exposure is roughly half that of India.
If you are concerned that radiation is harmful, then living in Toronto would be better, as the natural background radiation there is lower.
In the United States, the average natural background radiation dose is about three millisieverts per year.

These background levels are unavoidable since radiation comes from natural sources in the environment.
Understanding these reference levels helps put medical radiation doses into context.
