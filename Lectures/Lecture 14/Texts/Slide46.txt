Let me explain the basic concepts from your Green Book regarding radiation dose.
X-ray radiation is a form of electromagnetic radiation, and when it passes through your body, energy is deposited into your tissues. This energy deposited is called the absorbed dose.

The absorbed dose is a physical measurement of energy per unit mass of tissue, expressed in grays. One gray equals one joule per kilogram.
This is the fundamental concept of radiation dose—the energy your body absorbs from X-rays.
However, from a health perspective, the effective dose equivalent is more relevant.
To calculate this, the human body is divided into multiple organs or regions because different organs have different sensitivities to radiation.
Some tissues, like those involved in reproduction or rapidly regenerating cells, are more sensitive to radiation damage.
Therefore, younger women, children, and reproductive organs require special caution to avoid excessive exposure.
This sensitivity is accounted for by weighting factors, denoted by W.

The dose equivalent, represented by H, combines the absorbed dose with factors related to the type and energy of radiation.
Higher energy photons or particles generally cause more biological damage per unit of absorbed energy.
For example, X-rays, gamma rays, and alpha particles differ in their relative biological effectiveness.
To account for this, a quality factor, QF, is applied to quantify the biological impact of different radiation types.

For X-ray CT, the QF is normalized to one, but other radiation types have different values.
Thus, the effective dose equivalent is calculated using these weighted factors, resulting in a more accurate estimation of biological risk.
This calculation is summarized by a formula sometimes noted as equation 1.30 in radiation safety literature.
