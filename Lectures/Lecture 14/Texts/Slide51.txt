Now, let me explain the concept of the radiation dose profile, sometimes called the releasing profile.

Imagine you perform a circular CT scan. This scanning method reconstructs images within a single plane, called the XY plane.
Ideally, the X-ray beam would be finely collimated so that all photons are confined within the slice thickness, represented as a neat rectangular region—say, highlighted in yellow.

However, in reality, the system is not perfect.
You have scattered photons, and the emission is not perfectly confined.
Therefore, the actual radiation dose profile follows a curve, often shown as a blue curve.
This means that, even though you intend to irradiate only the slice thickness, some dose extends beyond this region.
This dose "tail" outside the intended slice area also contributes to the total patient radiation exposure.
