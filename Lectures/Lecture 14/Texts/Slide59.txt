On the other hand, for a bit of fun and creativity, you can try designing a futuristic portable CT scanner in an autonomous vehicle—think of it like something fancy and innovative.

I believe future technology will enable very affordable, fully reconfigurable CT scanners.
Imagine robotic X-ray detectors integrated into cars—if you want a screening, you just call like ordering an Uber.
The robotic scanner arrives at your home, performs the scan, and you get your results without leaving the house.
I think that will be incredibly cool and transformative.
