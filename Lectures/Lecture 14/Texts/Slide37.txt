Low contrast image resolution can be measured using resolution phantoms containing small test objects with subtle differences in density. These phantoms help to assess if the scanner and reconstruction algorithm can visualize objects with minor contrast differences.

When contrast is poor, like between blood vessels and surrounding tissue, contrast agents such as iodine are injected. These agents highlight the vessels, making blood, tumors, and related structures more visible.

This approach significantly improves low-contrast resolution, enabling better diagnosis and visualization of soft tissues.
