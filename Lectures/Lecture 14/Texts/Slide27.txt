Now, let me explain CT scanner architecture. To reconstruct images, we rely on line integrals from X-ray projections, using filtered backprojection and Fourier transform-based reconstruction, or interior tomography for region-of-interest reconstruction.
To acquire this data, you need hardware: the CT scanner itself. This is a donut-shaped structure called the gantry, which is the framework holding all components.

Inside, you find X-ray sources and collimators that shape the beam and filter out low-energy X-rays. Low-energy photons won’t penetrate the patient and only add an unwanted dose.
Collimators also reject scattered radiation to ensure the measured signal corresponds closely to the direct line integrals.

The scanner is a sophisticated device: you place the patient in the gantry, and from that, you acquire many images that resolve internal structures clearly.
