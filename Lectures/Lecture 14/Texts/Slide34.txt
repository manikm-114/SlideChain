Different body regions use different CT number windows for display. These windows are defined by minimum and maximum CT numbers, depending on the manufacturer or clinical application.

For instance, the full range of CT numbers might be mapped to 256 grayscale levels on a display, from white to black.
The human eye can typically distinguish about 50 shades within a window.
If too many shades are presented, subtle differences become difficult to see.

For lung imaging, for example, you might set the window maximum to about 250 Hounsfield units and the minimum to the air value.
Within this window, 256 gray levels help render tissues clearly. Anything outside the window appears clipped and is not visible.
This windowing is critical to tailoring visualization to different clinical needs.
