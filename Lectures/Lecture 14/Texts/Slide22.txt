It then took over a decade for the field to develop what is called the exact helical cone beam algorithm. This algorithm still uses the filtered backprojection framework but is mathematically exact.

The author, Dr. Katsevich, is a mathematician, so the paper is quite dense and challenging for most engineering students. Nonetheless, it demonstrates that modern CT theory can effectively handle longitudinally truncated data.

Earlier, I mentioned that in the second generation, data truncation happens transversely, while helical CT mainly deals with longitudinal data truncation, which can be seen as a symmetric problem.
