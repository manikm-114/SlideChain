In the new approach, we assume there is no known sub-region.
Instead, we model the region of interest as composed of finitely many sub-regions, each modeled by piecewise polynomials.

The boundaries of these sub-regions need not be known in advance. Each sub-region can be approximated by constant, quadratic, or more general multivariable polynomials.
This assumption matches the idea of band-limited signals from sampling theory.
With this sparsity-based model, where the ROI is decomposed into a small number of smooth regions, the interior reconstruction problem becomes solvable.

For example, in a chest CT scan, you can reconstruct the whole chest from all data or just from truncated data restricted to an ROI.
Here is a real dataset scanned on a Siemens scanner demonstrating this.
Interior tomography is no longer a mathematical curiosity but delivers practically good reconstruction results.
