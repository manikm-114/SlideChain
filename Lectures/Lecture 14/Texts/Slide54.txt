This concept of multiple scan average dose, or MSAD, is defined by an integral calculation.
Radiation dose from neighboring scans contributes to the dose in the current scan.
The number of adjacent scans considered is represented by N.

You perform the integration over the radiation dose profile, then normalize it by the slice thickness.
This normalization accounts for the actual tissue volume receiving radiation.
MSAD is another classic measure of radiation dose in CT.
With the rise of helical CT, there are new adaptations of these dose measurements, including for helical scanning and combined bimodal CT systems.

However, the fundamental principle behind measuring radiation dose remains the same.
As I mentioned earlier, understanding how we measure the release dose is essential to managing patient exposure.
