First, let me show you the four generations of CT scanning geometry, often called generations or modes. This basically refers to how you systematically collect X-ray projection data.

In the first generation, you have a single point X-ray source and a single point detector. Each measurement records one line, one line integral. The setup moves by translation, producing one parallel beam projection in one direction. Then the entire apparatus rotates slightly to a new angular position, producing another parallel beam projection. This process depends on the viewing angle, often labeled theta. That’s the first generation.
The second generation improves data acquisition efficiency. Instead of measuring one line integral at a time, you use a small detector array with a narrow fan beam. This detector array collects multiple lines simultaneously as it translates, covering the cross-section completely. Each translation collects multiple parallel beam projections, depending on how many detector shells you have. For example, if you have five detector shells, you get five parallel beam projections per translation. After a small rotation, you repeat this process.

The third generation further improves efficiency dramatically. Instead of a few detector elements, you have hundreds or thousands along a linear or arc-shaped wide detector array. This is a full fan beam imaging geometry. The detector array continuously rotates to collect data. This configuration satisfies the data sufficiency condition: performing a full 360-degree scan ensures every line through the patient’s cross-section is measured somewhere, so the line integrals are known. This third-generation geometry is still very popular. Modern CT scanners mostly use this geometry but have expanded the one-dimensional detector arrays into multi-row or cone-beam configurations. We’ll discuss those later.

The fourth generation differs by making the detector array a full stationary ring. Instead of rotating the detectors, only the X-ray source rotates around the patient. The detector ring stays fixed, continuously collecting signals. This fourth-generation geometry solves some mechanical problems associated with rotating the detector array.
