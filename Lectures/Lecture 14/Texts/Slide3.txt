So, let’s look at the outline for today’s lecture.

First, we’ll talk about projection data truncation—the issue when the X-ray projections don’t fully cover the object, which can cause artifacts.

Next, we’ll discuss different scanning modes used in CT technology.

Then, we will move on to common image artifacts that can degrade image quality.

Finally, we’ll cover X-ray radiation dose, which is important because it can be harmful to patients if not properly managed.
