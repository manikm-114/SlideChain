Now, let’s discuss longitudinal data truncation from a single slice. When you perform one helical turn with a single slice, you have a parallel beam and adjacent rays, allowing you to perform interpolation.

However, when you move to a wider angle cone beam, simple interpolation is no longer sufficient, and more advanced algorithms are needed. The first paper I wrote on cone beam helical scanning proposed an approximate algorithm for this challenge.
