At RPI, we have collaborated with GE Global Research Center and with Bruno Diem and others to develop optimized architectures for dedicated cardiac CT scanners.

We published a paper last year on this topic.
Designing a CT scanner is much like designing a building or room—you consider architecture and optimal layout.
Our team is currently preparing a grant proposal to advance this research. The proposal is due soon and covers aspects not addressed in previous reviews.
