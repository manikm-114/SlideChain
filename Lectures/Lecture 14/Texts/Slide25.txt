Let me add some comparison between classic CT and interior tomography.

According to classical theory, which we learned and which I explained in textbooks, you need to collect all data to satisfy the data sufficiency condition—usually a fan beam or cone beam that covers the entire cross-section or object.
The data must comprehensively cover the object for accurate reconstruction.
Interior tomography, however, only requires partial data limited to the region of interest.

Thus, with filtered backprojection, classic CT reconstructs a global image, like a wholesale business covering the entire area.
Interior tomography reconstructs a smaller, targeted area—like retail shopping.
This opens up new opportunities, providing flexibility and precision.
You only need to shoot X-rays through the important region, reducing dose and focusing on clinical needs.
