Now, in the 3D CT case, the X-ray source remains a point source. But instead of using a linear detector array, you use a planar or two-dimensional detector array.

This configuration results in a cone beam geometry originating from the point source.
The X-ray source emits radiation in a cone-shaped beam, which should be wide enough to cover the entire object.
In other words, the object must be fully contained within the cone beam to ensure complete data acquisition.
This concept is similar to the 2D case but extended to volumetric imaging.

Once you have all the rays, as shown here, you can rearrange, reorganize, or re-bin the X-rays into parallel beam geometry.
In parallel beam geometry, you can apply Fourier transform-based imaging methods.
The Fourier slice theorem allows the use of the one-dimensional Fourier transform on projections to recover the two-dimensional Fourier spectrum.
Each projection recovers a profile in Fourier space, and by changing the viewing angle, you sample different radial lines sweeping over the entire Fourier domain.

Likewise, in 3D imaging, an extended version of the Fourier slice theorem is required.
This involves applying Fourier transforms in higher dimensions to recover the 3D spatial frequency information of the object.
