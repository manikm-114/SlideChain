The noise you see in CT images is due to quantum effects and other random variations. Several factors influence this noise level, such as the tube current, often referred to as MAS. When the tube current is high, the X-ray tube emits more photons, so the statistical fluctuations decrease, which means less noise.

Image resolution also plays a key role. Think of pixel or voxel size in a simple way. If you have a large pixel, it collects many photons, resulting in a lower noise level. But if you target a very small, high-resolution pixel or voxel, fewer photons pass through it, so you need even more photons overall to maintain good image quality.

This is why interior tomography is advantageous. Since it directs photons only through the small region of interest, it reduces unnecessary exposure while maintaining image quality for the target structure.
