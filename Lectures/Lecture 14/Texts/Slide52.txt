Now, let's talk about the CT dose index, or CTDI.

Suppose the slice thickness is represented by T.
You integrate the radiation dose measurements over the slice thickness, effectively summing the dose contributions from the slice and imaginary adjacent slices—say, seven slices above and seven slices below.
All these doses are added together, and the total is then averaged by normalizing with the slice thickness T.
This result is what we call the CT dose index, or CTDI.

It's a simple yet important concept, as it includes any additional leakage radiation in the dose computation.
The CTDI provides a standardized measure of radiation output from the CT scanner, reflecting dose distribution within the irradiated volume.
