As we discussed in the previous lecture, when you collect X-ray projection data from an unimpeded perspective, you aim to reconstruct the image layer by layer, starting from the outermost shell.

It’s like peeling an onion, gradually revealing each layer beneath the surface.
To achieve this, you need to have X-ray measurements along every line passing through the region of interest.
For each X-ray, you want to record the line integral—the total attenuation along that path.
This situation pertains to 2D image reconstruction.

Always keep in mind the principle of unimpeded data acquisition.
We say there must be at least one point on the X-ray source trajectory for every line passing through the object.
In other words, you need a measured projection corresponding to every line through the cross-section.
This ensures you have complete data for accurate reconstruction.
