In other words, the network acts like a mathematical averaging system: if one region receives stronger signals, the center of activity is estimated there.\\n\\nSo, although an individual photomultiplier tube only gives you partial information, the combination of many tubes together, processed through the Anger logic, gives a precise two-dimensional location of the gamma ray event.

Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nNow that we know how to detect a signal, the next challenge is to determine where that signal came from. Detection is handled by the photomultiplier tubes, but localization—figuring out the exact position of the gamma ray interaction—is accomplished by what’s called the Anger network, named after Hal Anger, who invented the gamma camera.\\n\\nHere’s the idea. The photomultiplier tubes cannot be made infinitely small, so they are spaced apart. This means a single scintillation event—a flash of light in the crystal—will usually be seen by multiple tubes at once, with some receiving stronger signals and others weaker.\\nThe Anger network uses a carefully designed arrangement of resistors, as you see here, to spread out those signals. By analyzing the weighted distribution of the outputs, the system can calculate the event’s most likely position. In other words, the network acts like a mathematical averaging system: if one region receives stronger signals, the center of activity is estimated there.\\n\\nSo, although an individual photomultiplier tube only gives you partial information, the combination of many tubes together, processed through the Anger logic, gives a precise two-dimensional location of the gamma ray event. This way, every gamma ray photon detected is not only counted but also assigned a position in the image, allowing us to build up a full spatial map of radioactivity inside the body.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only.
