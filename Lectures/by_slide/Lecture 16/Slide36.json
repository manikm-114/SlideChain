From the following slide text,\\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nNow let’s make sense of the daily yield from a radionuclide generator. \\n\\nOn the left graph, the dashed line shows the parent isotope—molybdenum-99—which slowly decays over time. The solid line shows the daughter isotope—technetium-99m—which gradually builds up as the parent decays. At first, the daughter accumulates rapidly, but eventually, a balance is reached. Why? Because as more daughter atoms appear, they also begin to decay at a faster rate. At some point, the rate of production from the parent equals the rate of decay of the daughter. That balance defines the maximum activity of the daughter.\\n\\nThis is the key point emphasized in the text: the effective decay rate of the daughter is governed not by its own half-life alone, but by the half-life of the parent. The system naturally seeks equilibrium, so the ratio between parent and daughter becomes constant.\\nOn the right-hand graph, you see the practical outcome. Each spike represents an elution, where the daughter isotope is washed out of the generator for clinical use. Typically, this is done once every 24 hours. After each elution, the daughter begins to build up again from the parent, forming another peak. Over the course of days, however, the overall yield decreases because the parent itself is decaying exponentially.\\n\\nSo in practice, you get this repeating cycle: each day you harvest a certain amount of technetium-99m, use it for imaging, and then allow the generator to recharge. After about a week, the parent has decayed so much that the yield becomes too low, and the generator must be replaced.\\nThis is the essence of milking a radionuclide generator—an elegant and cost-effective way to provide a steady supply of short-lived tracers for nuclear medicine.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only.

Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nNow let’s make sense of the daily yield from a radionuclide generator. \\n\\nOn the left graph, the dashed line shows the parent isotope—molybdenum-99—which slowly decays over time. The solid line shows the daughter isotope—technetium-99m—which gradually builds up as the parent decays. At first, the daughter accumulates rapidly, but eventually, a balance is reached. Why? Because as more daughter atoms appear, they also begin to decay at a faster rate. At some point, the rate of production from the parent equals the rate of decay of the daughter. That balance defines the maximum activity of the daughter.\\n\\nThis is the key point emphasized in the text: the effective decay rate of the daughter is governed not by its own half-life alone, but by the half-life of the parent. The system naturally seeks equilibrium, so the ratio between parent and daughter becomes constant.\\nOn the right-hand graph, you see the practical outcome. Each spike represents an elution, where the daughter isotope is washed out of the generator for clinical use. Typically, this is done once every 24 hours. After each elution, the daughter begins to build up again from the parent, forming another peak. Over the course of days, however, the overall yield decreases because the parent itself is decaying exponentially.\\n\\nSo in practice, you get this repeating cycle: each day you harvest a certain amount of technetium-99m, use it for imaging, and then allow the generator to recharge. After about a week, the parent has decayed so much that the yield becomes too low, and the generator must be replaced.\\nThis is the essence of milking a radionuclide generator—an elegant and cost-effective way to provide a steady supply of short-lived tracers for nuclear medicine.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only.
