From the following slide text,\\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nNow let’s look at gamma decay.\\n\\nGamma decay occurs when a nucleus changes its internal configuration and releases the excess energy in the form of a gamma photon. This process does not change the number of protons or neutrons, so the element remains the same — only the energy state of the nucleus changes.\\nThere are two main categories. The first is immediate gamma decay. In this case, the nucleus drops from a higher energy state directly to a lower state, and a gamma photon is released right away.\\n\\nThe second category is more common and more useful in practice. Here, the nucleus does not release the gamma photon immediately. Instead, it first enters a metastable state. After a short delay, the gamma photon is released, sometimes along with other particles such as an antineutrino.\\nA classic example of this process is technetium-99m, often abbreviated as Tc-99m. The “m” stands for metastable. This isotope is widely used in nuclear medicine because of its convenient half-life and the gamma photons it emits, which are ideal for imaging.\\n\\nSo, gamma decay is highly relevant to nuclear imaging, especially in the form of isotopes like Tc-99m, which remains one of the most important tracers in clinical practice.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only.
