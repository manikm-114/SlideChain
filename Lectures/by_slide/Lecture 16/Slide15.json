X-rays typically fall within a certain energy range, while gamma rays can extend both lower and higher. In medical imaging, gamma rays are often in the range of hundreds of kilo-electronvolts.

In contrast, gamma rays are produced by transitions inside the nucleus itself. When an unstable nucleus changes from a higher energy state to a lower energy state, it releases that excess energy in the form of a gamma photon.\\n\\nThis distinction is important: X-rays come from interactions involving electrons, while gamma rays come directly from nuclear transitions.

Let’s look more closely at what that means.\\n\\nOn the electromagnetic spectrum, X-rays and gamma rays actually overlap in terms of energy. X-rays typically fall within a certain energy range, while gamma rays can extend both lower and higher. In medical imaging, gamma rays are often in the range of hundreds of kilo-electronvolts. For example, 511 kilo-electronvolts is a key energy level used in positron emission tomography, or PET. At lower energies, gamma rays are used in single-photon emission computed tomography, or SPECT.\\n\\nSo in terms of energy, X-rays and gamma rays are quite similar. The main difference lies in how they are generated. X-rays are produced by electron interactions — for instance, when high-energy electrons strike a tungsten target, generating X-rays in the process. In contrast, gamma rays are produced by transitions inside the nucleus itself. When an unstable nucleus changes from a higher energy state to a lower energy state, it releases that excess energy in the form of a gamma photon.\\n\\nThis distinction is important: X-rays come from interactions involving electrons, while gamma rays come directly from nuclear transitions. Both are powerful tools in imaging, and as we move forward, we’ll see in more detail how gamma rays are generated and used.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only.
