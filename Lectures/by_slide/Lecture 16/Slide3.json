First, we build a general understanding, then we dive into specific components like radioactivity, tracer production, and data acquisition.

Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nNow we begin the section on nuclear physics, which marks the start of our discussion on nuclear imaging as an imaging modality. As with every modality we cover, I’ll first give you a general perspective — a big picture introduction to provide background and context. After that, we’ll focus on the key elements specific to this modality.\\n\\nIn this course, I want you to always pay attention to the outline. The outline is your roadmap. It shows what’s important and helps you remember the structure of the topic. As in earlier lectures, I use visual markers like the red diamond and the green button to highlight the most essential points. These are your hints for where to focus.\\n\\nNow, some of you may feel concerned about prerequisites, such as calculus or differential equations. Don’t let that discourage you. Today, it’s easier than ever to look up mathematical concepts — a quick search can bring up explanations and definitions right away. What matters most is your willingness to learn. This field is highly interdisciplinary, and your goal should be to explore, connect, and build your own understanding of the knowledge you need.\\n\\nSo, as we step into nuclear physics, remember: our approach is not to memorize every detail, but to see the story. First, we build a general understanding, then we dive into specific components like radioactivity, tracer production, and data acquisition. Once you see the big picture, the details fall into place more naturally. Nuclear imaging is a fascinating field, and I hope you’ll enjoy this journey as much as I do.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only.
