It would be a nice exercise to build your own poster that highlights the main points of each modality. Of course, the poster I made for my graduate class goes much deeper, with governing equations. But here, for the undergraduate level, our goal is to provide a clear and introductory exposure.\\n\\nSo today, let me give you an outline. I think it’s always good to start with a roadmap, so you know where we are heading. For X-ray imaging, I’ll use this outline format to guide our discussion.\\nWe will cover three fundamental aspects: the source, the attenuation, and the detector. This sequence is very logical. First, you need an X-ray source. Without a source, nothing begins — it’s like trying to cook without rice. Next, those X-rays must interact with the human body. If there is no interaction, the photons just pass through like air, and we gain no information. If the body absorbs all the X-rays completely, again, no information escapes. The useful case is partial absorption: different tissues absorb X-rays to different degrees. That difference creates contrast, and contrast is what carries the diagnostic information.\\n\\nFinally, we need a detector to capture that information. The X-ray photons that escape the body must be recorded so that we can reconstruct an image. So in summary, the imaging chain has three main parts: the source, the interaction with the body, and the detector.

For X-ray imaging, I’ll use this outline format to guide our discussion.\\nWe will cover three fundamental aspects: the source, the attenuation, and the detector. This sequence is very logical. First, you need an X-ray source. Without a source, nothing begins — it’s like trying to cook without rice. Next, those X-rays must interact with the human body. If there is no interaction, the photons just pass through like air, and we gain no information. If the body absorbs all the X-rays completely, again, no information escapes. The useful case is partial absorption: different tissues absorb X-rays to different degrees. That difference creates contrast, and contrast is what carries the diagnostic information.\\n\\nFinally, we need a detector to capture that information. The X-ray photons that escape the body must be recorded so that we can reconstruct an image. So in summary, the imaging chain has three main parts: the source, the interaction with the body, and the detector. Together, they form the foundation of X-ray radiography.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only.
