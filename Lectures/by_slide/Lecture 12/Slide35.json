From the following slide text,\\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nNow let’s talk about an important concept in X-ray imaging: the anti-scatter grid.\\n\\nAs we discussed earlier, when X-rays interact with the body, two main processes occur — photoelectric absorption and scattering. In medical X-rays, scattering is very common. That means many photons change direction inside the body and then try to reach the detector from different angles. \\n\\nBut here’s the problem: what we really want to measure is the primary beam — the photons that travel straight along the original X-ray path. These are the photons that contain the true line integral information we need for accurate imaging. If scattered photons are also recorded, they blur the image and reduce contrast.\\n\\nTo solve this, we use an anti-scatter grid. You can think of it as a sheet with many tiny channels, almost like thousands of pinholes. Only photons traveling in the correct direction, aligned with the primary X-ray beam, can pass through these channels and reach the detector. Scattered photons, coming in at an angle, are blocked by the grid walls, which are made of dense materials such as lead.\\nThis dramatically improves image quality by reducing the effect of scatter. Of course, there are trade-offs. If the grid is very tall or tightly spaced, it rejects more scatter, but it can also block some of the primary beam, which reduces efficiency. Engineers must carefully design the grid’s height, spacing, and material to strike a balance between scatter rejection and preserving the useful signal.\\n\\nSo, in summary, the anti-scatter grid is a simple but powerful device that ensures we measure mostly the primary beam, giving us much clearer and more reliable images.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only.

From the following slide text,\\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nNow let’s talk about an important concept in X-ray imaging: the anti-scatter grid.\\n\\nAs we discussed earlier, when X-rays interact with the body, two main processes occur — photoelectric absorption and scattering. In medical X-rays, scattering is very common. That means many photons change direction inside the body and then try to reach the detector from different angles. \\n\\nBut here’s the problem: what we really want to measure is the primary beam — the photons that travel straight along the original X-ray path. These are the photons that contain the true line integral information we need for accurate imaging. If scattered photons are also recorded, they blur the image and reduce contrast.\\n\\nTo solve this, we use an anti-scatter grid. You can think of it as a sheet with many tiny channels, almost like thousands of pinholes. Only photons traveling in the correct direction, aligned with the primary X-ray beam, can pass through these channels and reach the detector. Scattered photons, coming in at an angle, are blocked by the grid walls, which are made of dense materials such as lead.\\nThis dramatically improves image quality by reducing the effect of scatter. Of course, there are trade-offs. If the grid is very tall or tightly spaced, it rejects more scatter, but it can also block some of the primary beam, which reduces efficiency. Engineers must carefully design the grid’s height, spacing, and material to strike a balance between scatter rejection and preserving the useful signal.\\n\\nSo, in summary, the anti-scatter grid is a simple but powerful device that ensures we measure mostly the primary beam, giving us much clearer and more reliable images.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only.
