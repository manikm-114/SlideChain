With two basis materials, two measurements are enough to solve the equations, and you can predict the X-ray response at any energy level.

These materials have sharp K-edges at very specific energies. To detect and separate them reliably, we need true energy-resolved imaging.\\nThat is exactly what a photon-counting detector provides. Instead of just two broad spectra, it measures photons across multiple energy bins. This allows us to do material decomposition and create chemically specific maps. In other words, we can actually tell apart iodine from calcium, or gold nanoparticles from bone, based on their spectral signatures.\\n\\nAnd this opens the door to something much more powerful: molecular and cellular imaging with CT.
