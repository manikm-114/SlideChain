If there is no interaction at all, the X-rays travel straight through as if the body were completely transparent. That doesn’t help us, because no useful information is recorded.\\nAt the other extreme, if there is total absorption, none of the X-rays make it out. That also gives us no signal.\\nThe most useful case is partial absorption, and that occurs through two main processes: scattering and the photoelectric effect. We’ll talk about these in more detail on the next slides.\\n\\nNow, at the atomic level, here’s what is happening: X-rays are photons, tiny packets of energy. When they strike the body, they may interact with molecules, atoms, or even inner electrons. Some photons pass through unchanged, forming the primary beam. Others are absorbed completely, transferring all their energy to the material. And still others are scattered — deflected in new directions, sometimes losing energy in the process.\\nIt’s the balance of these interactions that produces image contrast. Different tissues in the body — bone, muscle, fat, lung — attenuate X-rays to different degrees, which is why we can see structures in an X-ray image.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only.

Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nSo, how exactly do X-rays get attenuated?\\n\\nThink about it this way: when an X-ray beam passes through the body, several outcomes are possible. If there is no interaction at all, the X-rays travel straight through as if the body were completely transparent. That doesn’t help us, because no useful information is recorded.\\nAt the other extreme, if there is total absorption, none of the X-rays make it out. That also gives us no signal.\\nThe most useful case is partial absorption, and that occurs through two main processes: scattering and the photoelectric effect. We’ll talk about these in more detail on the next slides.\\n\\nNow, at the atomic level, here’s what is happening: X-rays are photons, tiny packets of energy. When they strike the body, they may interact with molecules, atoms, or even inner electrons. Some photons pass through unchanged, forming the primary beam. Others are absorbed completely, transferring all their energy to the material. And still others are scattered — deflected in new directions, sometimes losing energy in the process.\\nIt’s the balance of these interactions that produces image contrast. Different tissues in the body — bone, muscle, fat, lung — attenuate X-rays to different degrees, which is why we can see structures in an X-ray image.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only.
