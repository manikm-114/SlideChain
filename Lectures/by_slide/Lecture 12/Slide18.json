From the following slide text,\\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nNow that we’ve discussed how X-rays are generated, let’s look at the spectrum they produce.\\nFirst, notice the broad, continuous curve — this comes from Bremsstrahlung radiation. You can see that at lower photon energies, the intensity is relatively high, and as the energy increases, the intensity decreases. However, the very lowest-energy X-rays don’t actually appear in the output, because they are absorbed inside the tungsten target itself. Since the radiation is produced beneath the surface, the tungsten material acts as a natural filter, removing the very soft X-rays before they can escape.\\n\\nNext, at higher energies — around 70 kilo-electron-volts and above, for tungsten — you start to see sharp peaks. These are the characteristic X-rays, labeled here as K-alpha and K-beta. They occur only when the incoming electron energy is high enough to knock out inner-shell electrons, allowing outer electrons to fall into those vacancies and release very specific amounts of energy.\\nThe maximum X-ray energy you can obtain is determined by the tube voltage. For example, if the tube is operated at 120 kilovolts, then the maximum possible photon energy is 120 kilo-electron-volts. However, those very high-energy photons are less common compared to the middle range.\\n\\nFinally, the intensity of the spectrum — meaning the number of X-ray photons produced — depends strongly on the tube current. A higher current means more electrons striking the target, which produces more X-ray photons across the spectrum.\\nSo the shape of the X-ray spectrum is governed by three key factors: the filtering effect of the target, the discrete characteristic peaks, and the limits set by the tube voltage and current.\\nAnd keep in mind — this will also connect directly to one of your homework problems, so be sure to review it carefully.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only.

Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nNow that we’ve discussed how X-rays are generated, let’s look at the spectrum they produce.\\nFirst, notice the broad, continuous curve — this comes from Bremsstrahlung radiation. You can see that at lower photon energies, the intensity is relatively high, and as the energy increases, the intensity decreases. However, the very lowest-energy X-rays don’t actually appear in the output, because they are absorbed inside the tungsten target itself. Since the radiation is produced beneath the surface, the tungsten material acts as a natural filter, removing the very soft X-rays before they can escape.\\n\\nNext, at higher energies — around 70 kilo-electron-volts and above, for tungsten — you start to see sharp peaks. These are the characteristic X-rays, labeled here as K-alpha and K-beta. They occur only when the incoming electron energy is high enough to knock out inner-shell electrons, allowing outer electrons to fall into those vacancies and release very specific amounts of energy.\\nThe maximum X-ray energy you can obtain is determined by the tube voltage. For example, if the tube is operated at 120 kilovolts, then the maximum possible photon energy is 120 kilo-electron-volts. However, those very high-energy photons are less common compared to the middle range.\\n\\nFinally, the intensity of the spectrum — meaning the number of X-ray photons produced — depends strongly on the tube current. A higher current means more electrons striking the target, which produces more X-ray photons across the spectrum.\\nSo the shape of the X-ray spectrum is governed by three key factors: the filtering effect of the target, the discrete characteristic peaks, and the limits set by the tube voltage and current.\\nAnd keep in mind — this will also connect directly to one of your homework problems, so be sure to review it carefully.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only.
