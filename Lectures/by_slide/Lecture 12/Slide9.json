For now, I just want to give you a sense of how powerful this technology is.\\nWhen you see images like this, you realize how useful X-ray imaging can be. Hopefully, this motivates you to dig deeper — to understand how the X-ray source, the detectors, and the reconstruction process all work together to extract as much information as possible from the human body.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only.
