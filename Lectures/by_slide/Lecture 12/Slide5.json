At that time, he didn’t know what was happening — nobody did. He placed the tube inside a box, and unexpectedly, a nearby fluorescent screen lit up. When he looked closer, he noticed that objects could block or shape this invisible radiation. For example, a metallic cross placed in front of the tube cast a clear shadow on the screen.
