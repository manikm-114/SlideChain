From the following slide text,\\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nSo far, we’ve discussed how X-rays are attenuated as they pass through tissue. \\n\\nNow let’s see how this attenuation creates contrast in an image. Imagine a piece of tissue that is mostly uniform, but with a small bump or nodule inside it. The X-ray beam passing through the normal tissue travels a distance x. \\nIts signal is attenuated according to the exponential law:\\nA = N naught e to the power of minus μ x.\\nNow consider the ray that passes through the nodule. This ray travels an additional thickness, z. Its output is therefore:\\nB = N naught e to the power of minus μ (x plus z).\\nThe contrast is defined as the difference between the normal signal and the signal through the nodule, divided by the normal signal. Doing the math, we find:\\nContrast = 1 minus e to the power of minus μ z.\\nNotice that the contrast depends only on μ, the attenuation coefficient, and z, the extra thickness of the nodule.\\n\\nFor example, if the nodule is 1 centimeter thick, and μ equals 1 per centimeter, then the contrast comes out to about 63 percent. But in real soft tissue, μ is much smaller, closer to 0.2 per centimeter. In that case, the contrast becomes significantly lower, making small nodules much harder to detect.\\n\\nThis simple example shows the mechanism of attenuation contrast: the difference in signal arises because one path is slightly longer or passes through tissue with different attenuation properties. But in soft tissues, where μ values are close together, contrast can be very limited — and that is why techniques like contrast agents or advanced imaging methods are often necessary.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only.

From the following slide text,\\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nSo far, we’ve discussed how X-rays are attenuated as they pass through tissue. \\n\\nNow let’s see how this attenuation creates contrast in an image. Imagine a piece of tissue that is mostly uniform, but with a small bump or nodule inside it. The X-ray beam passing through the normal tissue travels a distance x. \\nIts signal is attenuated according to the exponential law:\\nA = N naught e to the power of minus μ x.\\nNow consider the ray that passes through the nodule. This ray travels an additional thickness, z. Its output is therefore:\\nB = N naught e to the power of minus μ (x plus z).\\nThe contrast is defined as the difference between the normal signal and the signal through the nodule, divided by the normal signal. Doing the math, we find:\\nContrast = 1 minus e to the power of minus μ z.\\nNotice that the contrast depends only on μ, the attenuation coefficient, and z, the extra thickness of the nodule.\\n\\nFor example, if the nodule is 1 centimeter thick, and μ equals 1 per centimeter, then the contrast comes out to about 63 percent. But in real soft tissue, μ is much smaller, closer to 0.2 per centimeter. In that case, the contrast becomes significantly lower, making small nodules much harder to detect.\\n\\nThis simple example shows the mechanism of attenuation contrast: the difference in signal arises because one path is slightly longer or passes through tissue with different attenuation properties. But in soft tissues, where μ values are close together, contrast can be very limited — and that is why techniques like contrast agents or advanced imaging methods are often necessary.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only.
