From the following slide text,\\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nLet’s talk about control flow — specifically, loops.\\nStart with a for loop. Use it when you know how many times you want to repeat something.\\nFor example:\\u000bSet x to zero.\\u000bThen, for i from 1 to 5 in steps of 2 — so, 1, 3, and 5 —\\u000bwe add i to x.\\u000bAt the end, x equals 9.\\nfor loops are useful when working through a known sequence.\\nNow, a while loop runs as long as a condition is true.\\nIn this example:\\u000bStart with x equal to 7.\\u000bWhile x is greater than or equal to zero, subtract 2 each time.\\u000bThe loop stops when x becomes negative.\\nJust be careful — if the condition never becomes false, the loop won’t stop.\\nFinally, break lets you exit a loop early.\\u000bIt’s useful if you find what you need before the loop finishes.\\u000bIn nested loops, it only exits the innermost one.\\u000bUse it wisely — don’t skip steps that still matter.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\\n- Assign exactly one category from:\\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\\n- Reject filler or administrative text.\\n- Output format:\\n{\\n  \\\"concepts\\\": [\\n    {\\\"term\\\": \\\"<exact term from slide>\\\", \\\"category\\\": \\\"<category>\\\"}\\n  ],\\n  \\\"evidence\\\": [\\\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\\\"]\\n}\\n\\nassistant\\n{\\n  \\\"concepts\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"term\\\": \\\"for loop\\\",\\n      \\\"category\\\": \\\"algorithm\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"term\\\": \\\"while loop\\\",\\n      \\\"category\\\": \\\"algorithm\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"term\\\": \\\"break\\\",\\n      \\\"category\\\": \\\"algorithm\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"term\\\": \\\"use it when you know how many times you want to repeat something\\\",\\n      \\\"category\\\": \\\"algorithm\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"term\\\": \\\"runs as long as a condition is true\\\",\\n      \\\"category\\\": \\\"algorithm\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"term\\\": \\\"exit a loop early\\\",\\n      \\\"category\\\": \\\"algorithm\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"term\\\": \\\"in nested loops, it only exits the innermost one\\\",\\n      \\\"category\\\": \\\"algorithm\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"term\\\": \\\"use it wisely — don’t skip steps that still matter\\\",\\n      \\\"category\\\": \\\"algorithm\\\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\\"evidence\\\": [\\n    \\\"Start with a for loop.
