Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nNow that we’ve seen how to work with equations, let’s take a moment to explore how we can inspect the structure of the data we’re working with — vectors and matrices.\\nTo find out how long a vector is, just use length — so length of v tells you how many elements it has.\\nIf you’re working with a matrix, and you want to know its shape — how many rows and columns — just use size of A.\\nWant to check if a matrix is full rank? That’s easy — rank of A will do the job.\\nAnd when we want to understand how large a matrix or vector is in terms of magnitude, we use the norm function. Just norm of A gives the 2-norm by default — that’s the square root of the sum of squares. You can also ask for specific norms like the 1-norm using norm of A, one, or the infinity norm with norm of A, inf.\\nThese commands give you insight into the structure and stability of your data — and they’re especially useful when you’re preparing data for algorithms or interpreting results.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only.
