Whole-body CT uses a significant amount of radiation, since it scans the entire patient with X-rays. In contrast, with whole-body PET, as shown in the figure, there is no space to easily position the X-ray components completely around the patient in the same way as traditional CT.\\n\\nHowever, researchers are actively thinking about creative solutions, and we actually encourage students to work on the possibility of achieving full-body CT simultaneously with PET, even when scanners are large enough to scan the whole body at once.
