From the following slide text,\\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nFor today’s homework, I have listed five problems. You are welcome to do more if you wish.\\n\\nThe first problem is about isosensitive imaging, which I briefly introduced earlier. It involves taking two views and compensating in a specific way. The key idea is that if you assume a simple binary case with only one source distribution, you can multiply the views to achieve compensation. However, remember that this is not a universal solution—it applies only under limited assumptions.\\n\\nThe second question asks how many total counts are necessary to achieve 1 percent uniformity in a SPECT image, given a 128 by 128 data matrix. This problem is fairly straightforward. You can solve it using the Poisson distribution along with basic sensitivity concepts. The answer should follow directly from these principles.\\nThe third exercise focuses on reducing statistical noise in an image. Consider what happens if you double the total imaging time, and separately, what happens if you double the mass of tracer injected. In each case, determine by what factor the noise in the image would be reduced.\\nThe fourth problem asks you to compute the energy of gamma photons produced from positron emission. The correct result should be 511 keV. To calculate this, apply the formula E equal m c square If needed, look up the rest mass of the electron and positron.\\n\\nFinally, the fifth question addresses artificially high levels of radioactivity observed in PET lung images. You are asked to suggest one possible mechanism by which this effect could occur. These exercises are designed to help you practice applying statistical principles, imaging physics, and basic quantitative reasoning to nuclear medicine problems.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only.

Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nFor today’s homework, I have listed five problems. You are welcome to do more if you wish.\\n\\nThe first problem is about isosensitive imaging, which I briefly introduced earlier. It involves taking two views and compensating in a specific way. The key idea is that if you assume a simple binary case with only one source distribution, you can multiply the views to achieve compensation. However, remember that this is not a universal solution—it applies only under limited assumptions.\\n\\nThe second question asks how many total counts are necessary to achieve 1 percent uniformity in a SPECT image, given a 128 by 128 data matrix. This problem is fairly straightforward. You can solve it using the Poisson distribution along with basic sensitivity concepts. The answer should follow directly from these principles.\\nThe third exercise focuses on reducing statistical noise in an image. Consider what happens if you double the total imaging time, and separately, what happens if you double the mass of tracer injected. In each case, determine by what factor the noise in the image would be reduced.\\nThe fourth problem asks you to compute the energy of gamma photons produced from positron emission. The correct result should be 511 keV. To calculate this, apply the formula E equal m c square If needed, look up the rest mass of the electron and positron.\\n\\nFinally, the fifth question addresses artificially high levels of radioactivity observed in PET lung images. You are asked to suggest one possible mechanism by which this effect could occur. These exercises are designed to help you practice applying statistical principles, imaging physics, and basic quantitative reasoning to nuclear medicine problems.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only.
