From the following slide text,\\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nLet’s now turn our attention to a very important and elegant result in linear algebra and geometry — the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality.\\n\\nIf you haven’t yet walked through the proof of this inequality, I encourage you to do so. It’s not just a theoretical result — it’s a tool that offers deep insight into how vectors relate to each other.\\n\\nNow, the inequality is written here in both summation and vector form.\\nYou can see here.\\n\\nIn vector form, we write:\\u000bThe absolute value of a dot b is less than or equal to the norm of a times the norm of b.\\n\\nIn plain terms, if you take the dot product of two vectors, its value will always be smaller than or equal to the product of their magnitudes.\\n\\u000bEquality holds only when one vector is a scalar multiple of the other — in other words, when the vectors are perfectly aligned.\\n\\nTo make this more concrete, let’s consider the two-dimensional version:\\u000bThe quantity a squared plus b squared, multiplied by c squared plus d squared, is greater than or equal to the square of a times c plus b times d.\\n\\nThis is a specific case of the inequality and shows how it works with actual vector components.\\nNow, how do we prove it?\\n\\nA typical approach involves setting up a quadratic expression that includes both vectors and a variable, x.\\u000bWe write the sum over i of the square of the quantity aᵢ times x plus bᵢ.\\u000bThis can also be written as the sum of aᵢ squared, multiplied by the square of x plus bᵢ divided by aᵢ\\u000b\\nWe set this whole expression equal to zero and solve the resulting quadratic equation.\\nThis works because the square of a real quantity is always non-negative, so the sum equals zero only when all terms vanish.\\u000bThat only happens when the vectors are linearly dependent — and that’s what gives us the equality condition.\\nNow, let’s connect this back to geometry. Remember from the last slide, the inner product of two vectors equals the product of their magnitudes times the cosine of the angle between them.\\n\\u000bThat is:\\u000bA dot B equals the norm of A times the norm of B times cosine theta.\\nSince cosine of theta is always between negative one and one, the dot product can never exceed the product of the magnitudes.\\u000bThat’s the geometric heart of the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality.\\n\\nSo this isn’t just an algebraic result — it’s a powerful guarantee about how closely two vectors can align.\\nAnd as we move into Fourier analysis, this principle plays a crucial role in how we represent signals, enforce orthogonality, and ensure numerical stability.\\nSo keep this inequality in mind — we’ll revisit it again when we start working with basis functions and Fourier coefficients.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only.
