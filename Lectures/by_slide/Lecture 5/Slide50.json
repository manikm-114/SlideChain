This will give you hands-on experience with how the Fourier series behaves—especially when approximating functions with sharp transitions. \\n\\nThis topic is a bit more involved than convolution, so I recommend reviewing the lecture carefully. But if you get the hang of it, you’ll find the transition to the Fourier transform much smoother in the next lecture.\\nGood luck—and see you next time.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only.
