Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nLet’s close this section with a powerful and elegant idea — something that ties everything we’ve learned so far into a single, intuitive picture.\\u000bEvery vector is a point.\\u000bThat’s right — a vector isn’t just a list of numbers. It represents a location in space.\\n\\nFor example, in two-dimensional space, a vector with components x and y — written as x, y — can be seen as a point on the plane.\\u000bIf this vector has unit length — meaning its magnitude is one — then it lies on the unit circle.\\u000bAs you move around that circle, each position corresponds to a different vector, but all with the same length.\\nNow in three dimensions, the same idea holds.\\u000bA unit-length vector becomes a point on the surface of a unit sphere.\\u000bAgain, the magnitude is one, but the direction can vary.\\u000bAnd every point on the sphere represents a different vector of unit length.\\nThis concept scales beautifully to higher dimensions.\\n\\u000bIn general, if we’re in n-dimensional space, the collection of all vectors of the same length — say, length r — forms an n-sphere.\\nMathematically, we write this as: S n equals open curly brace x in R n plus 1, such that double bar x double bar equals r close curly brace.\\nThis simply means: we’re gathering all the vectors that are at a fixed distance r from the origin.\\u000bEach of these vectors is also a point in space.\\u000bThey all have the same magnitude — r — but different directions.\\nSo geometrically, a vector is just a point, and when we fix the length of these vectors, they trace out meaningful shapes like circles in 2D, spheres in 3D, or hyperspheres in higher dimensions.\\n\\nThis perspective becomes especially important as we move forward into signal processing and functional spaces, where even functions can be treated like vectors — and those vectors live in infinite-dimensional spaces.\\nBut the core idea doesn’t change.\\u000bA vector is a point. A point is a vector.\\u000bAnd the same geometry that applies to physical space applies to abstract spaces as well — including the ones we’ll encounter next in our study of Fourier series.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only.
