It’s a bit more challenging, but it’s absolutely central to many applications in engineering, physics, and medical imaging. So, I’ll do my best to break it down and highlight the key ideas so that you can follow along with confidence.\\nLet’s get started.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\\n- Add modalities [\\\"text\\\"] by default; add \\\"image\\\" only if clearly visible without the text.\\n- Confidence in [0,1].\\n\\nOUTPUT:\\n{\\n  \\\"triples\\\": [\\n    {\\\"s\\\":\\\"<verbatim subject>\\\", \\\"p\\\":\\\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\\\",\\n     \\\"o\\\":\\\"<verbatim object>\\\", \\\"modalities\\\":[\\\"text\\\",\\\"image\\\"], \\\"confidence\\\":0.0, \\\"evidence\\\":\\\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\\\"}\\n  ]\\n}\\n\\nassistant\\n{\\n  \\\"triples\\\": []\\n}\", \"parsed\": {\"triples\": []}}"
