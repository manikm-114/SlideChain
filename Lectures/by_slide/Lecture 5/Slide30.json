From the following slide text,\\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nBefore that, here’s a really elegant and surprisingly powerful idea in mathematical analysis — something that’s often overlooked, but incredibly useful in practice.\\nNo matter what function you're dealing with — call it f of x — you can always split it into two parts:\\u000ban even part, and an odd part.\\n\\nAnd here’s how that works.\\nWe define the even part, denoted f e of x, as\\u000b“f of x plus f of negative x, all divided by two.”\\nMathematically, that’s:\\u000bf e of x equals one-half times the sum of f of x and f of minus x.\\nIf you plug in negative x into this expression, you’ll get:\\u000bf e of minus x equals one-half times f of minus x plus f of x —\\u000bwhich is exactly the same as f e of x.\\u000bSo this part is symmetric — it satisfies the condition of an even function.\\n\\nThen, we define the odd part, written as f o of x,\\u000bby subtracting instead of adding. So you get:\\u000bf o of x equals one-half times f of x minus f of negative x.\\nNow, if you evaluate this at negative x, you’ll find that:\\u000bf o of negative x equals negative f o of x.\\u000bThat’s the signature of an odd function — it’s antisymmetric about the origin.\\n\\nSo here’s the beauty:\\u000bEvery function, no matter how it looks, can be written as the sum of its even and odd parts.\\nIn other words,\\u000bf of x equals f e of x plus f o of x.\\nThis is a universal decomposition — and it's not just a neat identity.\\u000b\\nIt plays a critical role in understanding symmetry in signals, especially in Fourier analysis, where even and odd functions relate directly to cosine and sine components, respectively.\\nSo remember this trick.\\u000bWhenever you’re working with a function — especially in signal processing or image analysis — it’s often helpful to ask:\\u000bWhat’s its even part? What’s its odd part?\\u000bAnd how can we take advantage of that symmetry?\\nWe’ll put this idea to use shortly when we calculate the Fourier coefficients.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only.
