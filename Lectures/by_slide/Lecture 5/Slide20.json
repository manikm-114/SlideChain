So this classification is based on our point of view — not an absolute property of the function.\\n\\nNow here’s the deeper idea: sine and cosine functions together form an orthogonal basis. That means you can use them to represent any reasonable function — just like we previously used delta functions or unit vectors.\\nThis sets the stage for a powerful idea: instead of expressing a function as a sum of impulses, like a series of spikes, we can express it as a sum of waves — smooth, continuous, sinusoidal components.\\nAnd that’s exactly what we’ll explore next through the lens of the Fourier series.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only.
