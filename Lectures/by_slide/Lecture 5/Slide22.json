It tells us exactly how much of each frequency is present in the original function.\\n\\nThis is the core idea behind one-dimensional Fourier analysis. But it doesn’t stop there. We can extend the same concept to two-dimensional signals, like images — and even to three dimensions, when we’re working with volumes.\\nSo what begins as a sum of simple waves turns out to be a powerful way of analyzing and reconstructing complex signals in any dimension.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only.
