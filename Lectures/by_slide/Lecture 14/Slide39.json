This extra background leads to artifacts in the image—usually appearing as low-frequency streaking or haze that reduces contrast and clarity.\\nIf you correct for scattering components by estimating and subtracting them, you can restore the image quality close to the phantom reconstruction without scatter.\\n\\nOne common method to reduce scatter is using beam blockers placed strategically. These beam blockers function to block certain parts of the primary radiation, allowing measurement of scatter separately and improved image correction.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only.
