This is important because tumors may look very similar to surrounding tissue.\\nNarrow window settings, chosen carefully with a mean and range, help highlight these subtle differences.\\nIf the CT number difference is very small—say 5 to 10 Hounsfield units—and noise is comparable, detecting such differences requires boosting contrast effectively.\\n\\nHence, low contrast resolution depends not just on hardware but also on image noise characteristics.\\nTemporal resolution is crucial for dynamic organs like the heart. To get high-resolution cardiac images, both spatial and temporal resolution must be adequate.\\nIf your detector resolves fine details but scanning speed is too slow, motion blurring will reduce effective spatial resolution.\\nSo, achieving both fast scanning and high spatial resolution is essential.\\n\\nPhoton-counting detectors with elements as small as 55 microns are available, enabling very high-resolution imaging.\\nCombining this with interior tomography concepts and distributed thousands of photon-counting detector elements, it’s feasible to build a “magic ring” scanner that focuses on small regions of interest with resolution down to 100 microns.\\nThis is an area of active research that we continue to pursue.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only.
