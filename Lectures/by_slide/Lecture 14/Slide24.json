From the following slide text,\\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nIn the new approach, we assume there is no known sub-region.\\nInstead, we model the region of interest as composed of finitely many sub-regions, each modeled by piecewise polynomials.\\n\\nThe boundaries of these sub-regions need not be known in advance. Each sub-region can be approximated by constant, quadratic, or more general multivariable polynomials.\\nThis assumption matches the idea of band-limited signals from sampling theory.\\nWith this sparsity-based model, where the ROI is decomposed into a small number of smooth regions, the interior reconstruction problem becomes solvable.\\n\\nFor example, in a chest CT scan, you can reconstruct the whole chest from all data or just from truncated data restricted to an ROI.\\nHere is a real dataset scanned on a Siemens scanner demonstrating this.\\nInterior tomography is no longer a mathematical curiosity but delivers practically good reconstruction results.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only.
