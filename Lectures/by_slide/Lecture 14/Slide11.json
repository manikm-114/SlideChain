From the following slide text,\\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nLet's look at scanning modes. Here, you can visualize a diamond that helps you remember the progression of CT generations. The first generation uses a parallel beam, then a narrow fan beam in the second generation, followed by a wide fan beam with rotation in the third generation. The third generation features fan beam geometry with rotating detectors. Beyond that, we have the fourth and fifth generations. The next stages are called the sixth or seventh generation, which involve helical scanning.\\n\\nHelical scanning is quite an innovative, out-of-the-box idea. Traditionally, with one-dimensional detector arrays, imaging is done by rotating the source around the patient—often a half circle or full circle—to collect sufficient data for reconstructing one cross-section using filtered back projection or iterative reconstruction algorithms. After reconstructing one slice, the patient table is translated slightly to image the next cross-section. This process is known as the “step and shoot” mode.\\n\\nYou scan one cross-section, then move the patient, accelerate or decelerate the table, perform another full rotation, and repeat. This approach is time-consuming, especially because anatomical and pathological features exist in three dimensions, and patients can only hold still for limited times. Scanning slice by slice leads to low throughput and motion artifacts.\\nSpiral scanning solves many of these issues. You ask the patient to remain still, often holding their breath. Then, the table moves continuously while the X-ray source rotates, and data acquisition happens simultaneously and continuously. From the patient’s perspective, the source follows a helical trajectory, which is why this mode is called helical imaging.\\n\\nHowever, helical scanning introduces data truncation issues. In second-generation scanning, the data may be transversely truncated due to the small detector size. In helical scanning, data is longitudinally truncated because the source follows a helical path within any transverse plane, meaning a full two-dimensional data set for image reconstruction is absent.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only.

Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nLet's look at scanning modes. Here, you can visualize a diamond that helps you remember the progression of CT generations. The first generation uses a parallel beam, then a narrow fan beam in the second generation, followed by a wide fan beam with rotation in the third generation. The third generation features fan beam geometry with rotating detectors. Beyond that, we have the fourth and fifth generations. The next stages are called the sixth or seventh generation, which involve helical scanning.\\n\\nHelical scanning is quite an innovative, out-of-the-box idea. Traditionally, with one-dimensional detector arrays, imaging is done by rotating the source around the patient—often a half circle or full circle—to collect sufficient data for reconstructing one cross-section using filtered back projection or iterative reconstruction algorithms. After reconstructing one slice, the patient table is translated slightly to image the next cross-section. This process is known as the “step and shoot” mode.\\n\\nYou scan one cross-section, then move the patient, accelerate or decelerate the table, perform another full rotation, and repeat. This approach is time-consuming, especially because anatomical and pathological features exist in three dimensions, and patients can only hold still for limited times. Scanning slice by slice leads to low throughput and motion artifacts.\\nSpiral scanning solves many of these issues. You ask the patient to remain still, often holding their breath. Then, the table moves continuously while the X-ray source rotates, and data acquisition happens simultaneously and continuously. From the patient’s perspective, the source follows a helical trajectory, which is why this mode is called helical imaging.\\n\\nHowever, helical scanning introduces data truncation issues. In second-generation scanning, the data may be transversely truncated due to the small detector size. In helical scanning, data is longitudinally truncated because the source follows a helical path within any transverse plane, meaning a full two-dimensional data set for image reconstruction is absent.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only.
