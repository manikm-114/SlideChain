From the following slide text,\\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nWe have discussed various technologies to reduce radiation dose in CT scanning, including interior tomography and photon counting detectors.\\n\\nAdditionally, iterative reconstruction algorithms play a key role. Unlike traditional analytic algorithms, which do not account for image noise or statistical fluctuations, iterative methods model these factors explicitly.\\nBy doing so, they improve image quality while allowing dose reduction.\\nThose represent technological approaches to lowering patient radiation exposure.\\n\\nNow, I’d like to share something not in the slides—a more biological approach.\\nIonizing radiation causes real damage through DNA breaks and other effects.\\nSome medications or natural products contain antioxidants, which can help mitigate radiation-induced damage.\\nFor example, orange juice and blueberries contain antioxidants.\\nIf you search the literature, you’ll find several studies suggesting that antioxidants may have protective effects against radiation damage.\\nWhile this is not part of any clinical protocol, and doctors don’t routinely prescribe antioxidants before CT scans, I personally believe in their potential benefit.\\n\\nNext time I have a CT scan, I plan to drink two bottles of orange juice an hour beforehand.\\nIf you find this interesting, you might want to do your own research and consider consuming antioxidants before imaging.\\nOne of my students is setting up experiments to scientifically evaluate the protective effect of antioxidants, like orange juice, against radiation damage during CT scans.\\n\\nThis is an exciting area of ongoing research, and we hope to quantify the benefits more precisely in the future.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only.
