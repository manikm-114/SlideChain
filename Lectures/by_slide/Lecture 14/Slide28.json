You have the X-ray tube, which is quite heavy—for example, our lab’s donated GE tube is heavy.\\nPowering the tube requires a high-voltage supply and a cooling system; scanning consumes energy and heats the tube.\\nCooling is done with water or air to keep components at safe operating temperatures.\\nThis entire setup is called the gantry.
