From the following slide text,\\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nNow, let’s talk about time-gain compensation. When we deal with very high-frequency ultrasound—ultrasound signals in the megahertz range—the signal amplitude can be extremely small. If we simply record the raw signal amplitude or intensity as it is, without doing any correction, you’ll find that the deeper features inside the tissue appear much weaker than the ones near the surface.\\n\\nThis happens because of attenuation and wave scattering. As the ultrasound wave travels deeper, part of the energy is absorbed, and part of it is scattered in different directions. Both effects cause the returning signal—the echo—to decay exponentially with depth. Near the surface, the reflected wave is strong, but as you move deeper, the signal strength drops off very quickly. The decay roughly follows an exponential curve.\\n\\nTo correct for this loss, we apply what’s called time-gain compensation, or TGC. The idea is simple: as the echo arrives later in time—which corresponds to greater depth—you gradually increase the amplification factor. In other words, you boost the gain as a function of depth to counteract the exponential decay. The amplification curve roughly follows the opposite shape of the attenuation curve. When you multiply the received signal by this depth-dependent gain, the resulting image becomes more uniform in brightness.\\n\\nThis compensation makes the ultrasound image look much better and more interpretable. Without it, the deeper regions would appear dark and faint, while the shallow regions would look overly bright. With TGC, you recover a more balanced image. However, remember that this correction is based on assumptions about tissue homogeneity—it works well when the tissue properties are roughly uniform. In real biological tissue, conditions are not perfectly homogeneous, so the quantitative accuracy is not perfect.\\n\\nIt’s similar to what happens in CT imaging when we apply beam-hardening correction—we can reduce the artifacts, but it’s never a perfect fix. So, keep in mind that in ultrasound, different echo times correspond to different depths, and the deeper the echo, the stronger the amplification you need to apply. That’s the principle of time-gain compensation.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only.

Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nNow, let’s talk about time-gain compensation. When we deal with very high-frequency ultrasound—ultrasound signals in the megahertz range—the signal amplitude can be extremely small. If we simply record the raw signal amplitude or intensity as it is, without doing any correction, you’ll find that the deeper features inside the tissue appear much weaker than the ones near the surface.\\n\\nThis happens because of attenuation and wave scattering. As the ultrasound wave travels deeper, part of the energy is absorbed, and part of it is scattered in different directions. Both effects cause the returning signal—the echo—to decay exponentially with depth. Near the surface, the reflected wave is strong, but as you move deeper, the signal strength drops off very quickly. The decay roughly follows an exponential curve.\\n\\nTo correct for this loss, we apply what’s called time-gain compensation, or TGC. The idea is simple: as the echo arrives later in time—which corresponds to greater depth—you gradually increase the amplification factor. In other words, you boost the gain as a function of depth to counteract the exponential decay. The amplification curve roughly follows the opposite shape of the attenuation curve. When you multiply the received signal by this depth-dependent gain, the resulting image becomes more uniform in brightness.\\n\\nThis compensation makes the ultrasound image look much better and more interpretable. Without it, the deeper regions would appear dark and faint, while the shallow regions would look overly bright. With TGC, you recover a more balanced image. However, remember that this correction is based on assumptions about tissue homogeneity—it works well when the tissue properties are roughly uniform. In real biological tissue, conditions are not perfectly homogeneous, so the quantitative accuracy is not perfect.\\n\\nIt’s similar to what happens in CT imaging when we apply beam-hardening correction—we can reduce the artifacts, but it’s never a perfect fix. So, keep in mind that in ultrasound, different echo times correspond to different depths, and the deeper the echo, the stronger the amplification you need to apply. That’s the principle of time-gain compensation.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only.
