From the following slide text,\\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nNow, let’s look at another approach—the correlation method, which is quite intuitive. You start with a transducer that sends out a pulse of ultrasound and records the entire backscattered signal as a function of time. That gives you a complete waveform, not just a single data point. Then, you send a second pulse, and again you record the returned signal. By the time the second pulse arrives, the scatterers—such as red blood cells—will have moved slightly compared to their original positions.\\n\\nTo find out how much motion occurred, we compare the two signals using correlation. You look for the time delay, denoted as tau, where the two signals are most similar. This time delay tells you how far the scatterers have moved between the two measurements. When you multiply that tau by the sound speed along the beam direction, you get the relative displacement. From that, you can calculate the velocity or even derive the Doppler frequency if you prefer.\\n\\nSo, this is the basic idea behind the correlation method—it’s simple but very effective. By comparing the returning waveforms over time, we can accurately measure how fast and in what direction the blood or tissue is moving. This is often used alongside Doppler analysis to enhance motion estimation accuracy.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only.

Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nNow, let’s look at another approach—the correlation method, which is quite intuitive. You start with a transducer that sends out a pulse of ultrasound and records the entire backscattered signal as a function of time. That gives you a complete waveform, not just a single data point. Then, you send a second pulse, and again you record the returned signal. By the time the second pulse arrives, the scatterers—such as red blood cells—will have moved slightly compared to their original positions.\\n\\nTo find out how much motion occurred, we compare the two signals using correlation. You look for the time delay, denoted as tau, where the two signals are most similar. This time delay tells you how far the scatterers have moved between the two measurements. When you multiply that tau by the sound speed along the beam direction, you get the relative displacement. From that, you can calculate the velocity or even derive the Doppler frequency if you prefer.\\n\\nSo, this is the basic idea behind the correlation method—it’s simple but very effective. By comparing the returning waveforms over time, we can accurately measure how fast and in what direction the blood or tissue is moving. This is often used alongside Doppler analysis to enhance motion estimation accuracy.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only.
