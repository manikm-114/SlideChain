From the following slide text,\\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nSo, you think—look at this. The transducer sends out ultrasound waves at the speed of c toward a stationary object. In this case, the speed c equals frequency times wavelength. The wavelength is basically how far the wave moves during one vibration. And how many times do you vibrate? That’s the frequency. So, frequency times wavelength equals the speed c.\\n\\nNow, in one unit of time, in this stationary case, you see four pulses. I should make that plural—four pulses are sent into the object. This is the reference situation. This simple example gives you the baseline idea, and I just drew more examples to make it clearer.\\n\\nNow, think about the moving situation. I say, when the object is moving, you will see the apparent frequency change. How does that happen? Think about this: let’s say this same stationary object now starts a steady motion toward the transducer. This is just for simplicity. In fact, the object’s motion is also at a certain velocity, denoted v, and the sound itself travels with velocity c.\\n\\nSo, in one unit of time, the sound will travel a distance c. In that same unit time, you have four pulses sent into the object. But now, in the second case, the object is moving—also with velocity v—so within that same unit time, the moving object will cover a certain distance. Because it covers that distance, if it were stationary, it would have received four pulses. But now, since it moves toward the transducer, those four pulses that were still traveling through space are “caught” or “eaten up” by the moving object.\\n\\nSo, this object will intercept not just the original four pulses, but also an additional four pulses that were on their way. Altogether, you now have eight pulses entering the object in one unit of time. Let’s assume the object is a perfect reflector.\\n\\nIn the first case—when the object is stationary—you have four pulses entering, and it will reflect four pulses within that unit time. So, you receive four reflected pulses, and that gives you the same frequency as the transmitted one—no frequency change. The object vibrates four times, and you see four reflected waves per unit time.\\n\\nBut in the second case—when the object is moving toward the transducer—it takes eight pulses within the same time period. If it is a perfect reflector, those eight pulses are now reflected back within one unit of time. So, the reflected signal contains eight pulses per unit time, meaning the reflected frequency is doubled.\\n\\nThis is how a moving object changes the reflected frequency. You get a signal reflected back with a higher frequency, and the difference between the stationary and moving cases is the Doppler effect.\\n\\nSo, this is the idea. Think about this simple diagram, and then review the equations again. If you think about the connection between this cartoon and those equations, you will gain a much better understanding of the formula—especially the one where we talk about the velocity component v times cosine θ.\\n\\nOnly the portion of the velocity component along the beam direction contributes to the observed frequency shift. That’s the part of motion you can measure as the carrying frequency. The incident frequency is the transmitted one, and the frequency shift—the Doppler shift—is this difference.\\nThis normalization factor is simply the speed of sound, c. So, think about it this way: half of the transmitted power goes out, then it comes back after reflection. That’s the basic Doppler imaging process.\\n\\nDoppler imaging is an important part of the ultrasound chapter. To really understand Doppler imaging, the key is to understand this formula. If you follow the derivation, it might not be totally clear at first, but if you understand this cartoon analogy, you can see how the Doppler frequency shift is generated.\\n\\nThe same idea applies across all situations. So, follow these formulas systematically. Then you’ll see what’s going on—why there’s a connection between the Doppler frequency shift and the velocity component that you’re measuring along the ultrasound beam direction.\\n\\nIf the motion is parallel to the beam, the Doppler shift is at its maximum. If the motion is perpendicular to the beam, you cannot measure it. You can only measure the Doppler frequency shift along the beam direction.\\n\\nThis is a simple idea, but it gives you a very good understanding of what’s happening physically.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only.

Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nSo, you think—look at this. The transducer sends out ultrasound waves at the speed of c toward a stationary object. In this case, the speed c equals frequency times wavelength. The wavelength is basically how far the wave moves during one vibration. And how many times do you vibrate? That’s the frequency. So, frequency times wavelength equals the speed c.\\n\\nNow, in one unit of time, in this stationary case, you see four pulses. I should make that plural—four pulses are sent into the object. This is the reference situation. This simple example gives you the baseline idea, and I just drew more examples to make it clearer.\\n\\nNow, think about the moving situation. I say, when the object is moving, you will see the apparent frequency change. How does that happen? Think about this: let’s say this same stationary object now starts a steady motion toward the transducer. This is just for simplicity. In fact, the object’s motion is also at a certain velocity, denoted v, and the sound itself travels with velocity c.\\n\\nSo, in one unit of time, the sound will travel a distance c. In that same unit time, you have four pulses sent into the object. But now, in the second case, the object is moving—also with velocity v—so within that same unit time, the moving object will cover a certain distance. Because it covers that distance, if it were stationary, it would have received four pulses. But now, since it moves toward the transducer, those four pulses that were still traveling through space are “caught” or “eaten up” by the moving object.\\n\\nSo, this object will intercept not just the original four pulses, but also an additional four pulses that were on their way. Altogether, you now have eight pulses entering the object in one unit of time. Let’s assume the object is a perfect reflector.\\n\\nIn the first case—when the object is stationary—you have four pulses entering, and it will reflect four pulses within that unit time. So, you receive four reflected pulses, and that gives you the same frequency as the transmitted one—no frequency change. The object vibrates four times, and you see four reflected waves per unit time.\\n\\nBut in the second case—when the object is moving toward the transducer—it takes eight pulses within the same time period. If it is a perfect reflector, those eight pulses are now reflected back within one unit of time. So, the reflected signal contains eight pulses per unit time, meaning the reflected frequency is doubled.\\n\\nThis is how a moving object changes the reflected frequency. You get a signal reflected back with a higher frequency, and the difference between the stationary and moving cases is the Doppler effect.\\n\\nSo, this is the idea. Think about this simple diagram, and then review the equations again. If you think about the connection between this cartoon and those equations, you will gain a much better understanding of the formula—especially the one where we talk about the velocity component v times cosine θ.\\n\\nOnly the portion of the velocity component along the beam direction contributes to the observed frequency shift. That’s the part of motion you can measure as the carrying frequency. The incident frequency is the transmitted one, and the frequency shift—the Doppler shift—is this difference.\\nThis normalization factor is simply the speed of sound, c. So, think about it this way: half of the transmitted power goes out, then it comes back after reflection. That’s the basic Doppler imaging process.\\n\\nDoppler imaging is an important part of the ultrasound chapter. To really understand Doppler imaging, the key is to understand this formula. If you follow the derivation, it might not be totally clear at first, but if you understand this cartoon analogy, you can see how the Doppler frequency shift is generated.\\n\\nThe same idea applies across all situations. So, follow these formulas systematically.

You can only measure the Doppler frequency shift along the beam direction.\\n\\nThis is a simple idea, but it gives you a very good understanding of what’s happening physically.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only.
