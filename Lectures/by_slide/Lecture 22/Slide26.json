From the following slide text,\\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nNow let’s take a closer look at what actually happens to the signal. You have one signal going in and another signal coming out. The input signal is transmitted at a certain frequency, which we call f-i, while the received signal includes a small Doppler frequency shift, noted as delta-f. So, the frequency of the returning signal becomes f-i plus delta-f. This delta-f can be either positive or negative, depending on whether the target is moving toward or away from the transducer. \\n\\nUsing digital signal processing, we can compare these two signals. The received signal is multiplied by the reference signal generated by the transmitter, and this multiplication is performed by a circuit called a mixer, which effectively combines the two signals. Mathematically, this creates two components—one at a very high frequency, which is the sum of the two, and one at a much lower frequency, which is their difference.\\n\\nSince the transmitted frequency f-i is in the high ultrasound range and the Doppler shift delta-f is quite small, we use a low-pass filter to remove the high-frequency component and keep only the low-frequency term that carries the Doppler information. After filtering, the output signal is proportional to A over two times cosine of two-pi times delta-f times t, where A is the amplitude of the signal. This low-frequency signal represents the Doppler shift itself and allows us to estimate the velocity v using the formula you saw earlier: delta-f equals two times f-i times v times cosine theta divided by c. \\n\\nSo, by measuring delta-f, we can determine how fast the object is moving along the ultrasound beam direction. However, remember that continuous-wave Doppler does not provide depth information. It tells you the velocity but not the exact location of the moving target, because the transducer is transmitting and receiving continuously along the entire beam path. So, continuous-wave Doppler gives accurate velocity data, but without depth resolution.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only.

Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nNow let’s take a closer look at what actually happens to the signal. You have one signal going in and another signal coming out. The input signal is transmitted at a certain frequency, which we call f-i, while the received signal includes a small Doppler frequency shift, noted as delta-f. So, the frequency of the returning signal becomes f-i plus delta-f. This delta-f can be either positive or negative, depending on whether the target is moving toward or away from the transducer. \\n\\nUsing digital signal processing, we can compare these two signals. The received signal is multiplied by the reference signal generated by the transmitter, and this multiplication is performed by a circuit called a mixer, which effectively combines the two signals. Mathematically, this creates two components—one at a very high frequency, which is the sum of the two, and one at a much lower frequency, which is their difference.\\n\\nSince the transmitted frequency f-i is in the high ultrasound range and the Doppler shift delta-f is quite small, we use a low-pass filter to remove the high-frequency component and keep only the low-frequency term that carries the Doppler information. After filtering, the output signal is proportional to A over two times cosine of two-pi times delta-f times t, where A is the amplitude of the signal. This low-frequency signal represents the Doppler shift itself and allows us to estimate the velocity v using the formula you saw earlier: delta-f equals two times f-i times v times cosine theta divided by c. \\n\\nSo, by measuring delta-f, we can determine how fast the object is moving along the ultrasound beam direction. However, remember that continuous-wave Doppler does not provide depth information. It tells you the velocity but not the exact location of the moving target, because the transducer is transmitting and receiving continuously along the entire beam path. So, continuous-wave Doppler gives accurate velocity data, but without depth resolution.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only.
