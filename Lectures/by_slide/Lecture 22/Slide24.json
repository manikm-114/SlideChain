From the following slide text,\\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nNow, let’s talk about how Doppler imaging is actually performed. You can use a continuous wave (CW) method, where you keep sending ultrasound waves continuously, or a pulsed wave (PW) method, where you send one pulse at a time—a train of pulses—to measure the Doppler information. Another important technique is echo correlation, where you send one signal, receive it back, then send another signal, and again receive it back. By comparing the relative phase changes through correlation, you can detect motion.\\n\\nCorrelation tells you how much one signal matches another. In the foundation part, we mentioned the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, which states that if two waveforms are perfectly correlated, they represent the same event at a specific location. When the reflector moves, the correlation pattern shifts, which reveals how much the object has displaced between the two measurements.\\n\\nYou can also combine Doppler imaging with B-mode imaging. The B-mode provides an anatomical background—essentially, a grayscale structural image. If you have multiple two-dimensional B-mode slices, you can reconstruct a three-dimensional ultrasound volume. On top of this anatomical structure, you can superimpose the velocity distribution obtained from Doppler measurements.\\n\\nVelocity is a vector quantity, meaning it has both amplitude and direction. You can visualize these vectors using color coding. For example, motion in one direction may appear in red, motion in the opposite direction may appear in green, and another perpendicular direction may be shown in blue. The color intensity represents the velocity amplitude. With this color flow encoding, you can visualize the complete velocity field superimposed on the anatomical image. This combined visualization—structural plus velocity—is the essence of Doppler imaging.

Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nNow, let’s talk about how Doppler imaging is actually performed. You can use a continuous wave (CW) method, where you keep sending ultrasound waves continuously, or a pulsed wave (PW) method, where you send one pulse at a time—a train of pulses—to measure the Doppler information. Another important technique is echo correlation, where you send one signal, receive it back, then send another signal, and again receive it back. By comparing the relative phase changes through correlation, you can detect motion.\\n\\nCorrelation tells you how much one signal matches another. In the foundation part, we mentioned the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, which states that if two waveforms are perfectly correlated, they represent the same event at a specific location. When the reflector moves, the correlation pattern shifts, which reveals how much the object has displaced between the two measurements.\\n\\nYou can also combine Doppler imaging with B-mode imaging. The B-mode provides an anatomical background—essentially, a grayscale structural image. If you have multiple two-dimensional B-mode slices, you can reconstruct a three-dimensional ultrasound volume. On top of this anatomical structure, you can superimpose the velocity distribution obtained from Doppler measurements.\\n\\nVelocity is a vector quantity, meaning it has both amplitude and direction. You can visualize these vectors using color coding. For example, motion in one direction may appear in red, motion in the opposite direction may appear in green, and another perpendicular direction may be shown in blue. The color intensity represents the velocity amplitude. With this color flow encoding, you can visualize the complete velocity field superimposed on the anatomical image. This combined visualization—structural plus velocity—is the essence of Doppler imaging.
