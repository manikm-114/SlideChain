MRI uses a completely different approach compared to X-ray and nuclear imaging techniques including PET and SPECT. In MRI, we utilize radio frequency signals to gather detailed images of the body.\\n\\nHere’s how it works: First, we subject the patient to a very strong magnetic field. This magnetic field aligns the hydrogen nuclei—which are abundant in water molecules in your body. Then, we introduce a radio frequency (RF) signal that briefly disrupts this alignment, causing the hydrogen nuclei to emit their own radio frequency signals as they return to their original stable state.\\n\\nThe key advantage of MRI is that it is sensitive to the water content in different tissues and interactions of hydrogen nuclei with their micro-environments, which makes MRI extremely useful for imaging soft tissues like the brain, muscles, and organs. The signal we collect can give us a lot of valuable information, such as chemical shifts in tissues, which help us distinguish between different types of tissues and even detect abnormalities like tumors or inflammation.\\n\\nMRI is also great for studying brain activity, as the technique can be used to observe changes in blood flow over time. This makes MRI not only a structural imaging tool but also a functional one, adding a layer of depth to our understanding of the body.\\n\\nTogether with CT and nuclear imaging techniques, MRI forms the trio of most important imaging modalities. While CT focuses on capturing detailed anatomical structures using X-rays, and nuclear imaging provides insight into physiological functions, MRI offers unmatched soft tissue contrast and the ability to examine both structure and function in a non-invasive way, even into our thinking processes.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only.

MRI uses a completely different approach compared to X-ray and nuclear imaging techniques including PET and SPECT. In MRI, we utilize radio frequency signals to gather detailed images of the body.\\n\\nHere’s how it works: First, we subject the patient to a very strong magnetic field. This magnetic field aligns the hydrogen nuclei—which are abundant in water molecules in your body. Then, we introduce a radio frequency (RF) signal that briefly disrupts this alignment, causing the hydrogen nuclei to emit their own radio frequency signals as they return to their original stable state.\\n\\nThe key advantage of MRI is that it is sensitive to the water content in different tissues and interactions of hydrogen nuclei with their micro-environments, which makes MRI extremely useful for imaging soft tissues like the brain, muscles, and organs. The signal we collect can give us a lot of valuable information, such as chemical shifts in tissues, which help us distinguish between different types of tissues and even detect abnormalities like tumors or inflammation.\\n\\nMRI is also great for studying brain activity, as the technique can be used to observe changes in blood flow over time. This makes MRI not only a structural imaging tool but also a functional one, adding a layer of depth to our understanding of the body.\\n\\nTogether with CT and nuclear imaging techniques, MRI forms the trio of most important imaging modalities. While CT focuses on capturing detailed anatomical structures using X-rays, and nuclear imaging provides insight into physiological functions, MRI offers unmatched soft tissue contrast and the ability to examine both structure and function in a non-invasive way, even into our thinking processes.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only.
