In image processing, we model it using something called a point spread function—or PSF for short. This describes how a single point of light spreads out in the image.\\n\\nThe process that causes blurring is called convolution. It’s a mathematical operation that combines the original image with the PSF. Convolution is sort of like multiplication—but in the so-called Fourier space that we will explain later in this course. Indeed, in the Fourier domain, convolution becomes regular multiplication. The Fourier transform is often performed using a fast algorithm, FFT in short. That simplifies a lot of computations.\\n\\nBut now comes the hard part: what if all you have is the blurry image? Can you work backward and recover the original, sharp version?\\n\\nThat’s another inverse problem. And just like with tomography, it’s tricky. You're trying to undo the effect of the blur, based on your knowledge of the system. It takes clever algorithms and good models—but it can be done.
