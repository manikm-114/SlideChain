And interestingly, “GE” also happens to be my initials—but theirs is with a capital E. So, no confusion!\\n\\nGE was founded back in 1892, not long after X-rays were discovered. And Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute was founded even earlier. So these two organizations have grown side by side, both focused on pushing the boundaries of science and technology.\\n\\nGE has been part of some most transformative developments in imaging—from early X-ray machines to advanced MR scanners. They’ve really helped shape this field.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only.
