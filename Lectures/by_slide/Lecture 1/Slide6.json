Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nNow, let’s go back to where it all began. In 1895, a German physicist named Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen was experimenting with cathode rays when he discovered something totally unexpected—an invisible form of radiation that could pass through solid objects. He called them X-rays because he didn’t quite know what they were.\\n\\nTo test his discovery, he took the first X-ray image—a picture of his wife’s hand. You could clearly see the bones, and even her wedding ring. It was the first time humans saw inside the body without surgery. That moment changed medicine forever.\\n\\nX-rays could depict dense structures like bones and metal with incredible clarity. This breakthrough was so significant that Roentgen received a Nobel Prize in 1901.\\n\\nThat single discovery launched the field of radiology—and over a century later, we’re still building on it.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only.
