As artificial intelligence continues to advance, we’re already seeing systems that can match or even surpass human performance in interpreting medical images. It’s very possible that, in the not-so-distant future, many of the tasks traditionally done by radiologists will be basically handled by AI.\\n\\nAnd it goes beyond that. Imagine robotic surgeons, guided by multimodal imaging and machine learning, performing procedures with precision that’s hard for even the best human surgeon to match.
