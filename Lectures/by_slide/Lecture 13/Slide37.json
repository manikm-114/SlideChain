The smear-back results are added together, because the integral with respect to d-theta is just a summation. You smear back one projection—you get a picture like this. You take another projection—you smear back the other way. You add the two together. Many projections add many contributions together.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only.
