You have a cross-section, and you arbitrarily draw lines—these are the X-ray paths. For any such line, we say you can find at least one source position. \\n\\nWhat does that mean? It means that along this line, an X-ray source sends rays in this direction, so the line integral, or ray-sum, is measured. It doesn’t mean you have every piece of information you might want.

Even if I wouldn’t test it again, you need to understand Fourier analysis so that you understand CT and MRI much better. Anyway, this is the idea of the data sufficiency condition.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\\n- Add modalities [\\\"text\\\"] by default; add \\\"image\\\" only if clearly visible without the text.\\n- Confidence in [0,1].\\n\\nOUTPUT:\\n{\\n  \\\"triples\\\": [\\n    {\\\"s\\\":\\\"<verbatim subject>\\\", \\\"p\\\":\\\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\\\",\\n     \\\"o\\\":\\\"<verbatim object>\\\", \\\"modalities\\\":[\\\"text\\\",\\\"image\\\"], \\\"confidence\\\":0.0, \\\"evidence\\\":\\\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\\\"}\\n  ]\\n}\\n\\nassistant\\n{\\n  \\\"triples\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"s\\\": \\\"There exists at least a source on any line intersecting a cross-section\\\",\\n      \\\"p\\\": \\\"represents\\\",\\n      \\\"o\\\": \\\"the maximum amount of data you can measure, which happens to be sufficient\\\",\\n      \\\"modalities\\\": [\\\"text\\\", \\\"image\\\"],\\n      \\\"confidence\\\": 0.95,\\n      \\\"evidence\\\": \\\"These represent the maximum amount of data you can measure, which happens to be sufficient\\\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\", \"parsed\": {\"triples\": []}}"
