This is the band-limited high-pass filtering. \\n\\nYou can read more if you are interested, but anyway, these are practical implementation details about high-pass filtering for filtered backprojection. What I have explained here is only the two-dimensional case.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\\n- Add modalities [\\\"text\\\"] by default; add \\\"image\\\" only if clearly visible without the text.\\n- Confidence in [0,1].\\n\\nOUTPUT:\\n{\\n  \\\"triples\\\": [\\n    {\\\"s\\\":\\\"<verbatim subject>\\\", \\\"p\\\":\\\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\\\",\\n     \\\"o\\\":\\\"<verbatim object>\\\", \\\"modalities\\\":[\\\"text\\\",\\\"image\\\"], \\\"confidence\\\":0.0, \\\"evidence\\\":\\\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\\\"}\\n  ]\\n}\\n\\nassistant\\n{\\n  \\\"triples\\\": []\\n}\", \"parsed\": {\"triples\": []}}"
