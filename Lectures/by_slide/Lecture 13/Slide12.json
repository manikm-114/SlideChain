With X-rays, we can measure parallel-beam projections as shown here. Along each X-ray, each datum gives you one linear system equation. If you have a parallel beam at projection angle theta, and you have, say, one hundred rays or five hundred rays, then you have one hundred or five hundred linear system equations.\\n\\nOne view is not enough, because you cannot resolve superimposed structures—you see two things on top of each other, and you do not know which one is on top and which one is beneath. So you need to keep changing theta.\\nThe original function f of x, y is converted to a new two-dimensional function p of theta, t. Theta is the angle; t is the coordinate. Using X-ray measurements, you perform a physical or mathematical transform from f of x, y to p of theta, t.\\n\\nFor example, if you have a bright, small disk, it will trace a sinusoidal curve. That is why we call the data-domain representation a sinogram. We also call it a Radon transform—Radon was a mathematician many years ago.
