From the following slide text,\\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nThis is what I call the onion-peeling idea.\\u000b\\nThink of a picture and decompose it into a collection of pixels. The pixel does not have to be rectangular; here, I use triangular pixels. I perform the decomposition into many, many triangular pixels and then resolve the unknowns layer by layer. Start with the outermost unknowns, represented as a right triangle. This is a heuristic idea, so follow the logic.\\n\\nIn the limiting case, imagine the object support where an X-ray touches one molecule, an extremely small element. Take this as an example: you have a small material element. You know the incoming intensity, you know the attenuated intensity, and because the data are partitioned, you know the total path length. From these three knowns, you can resolve the only unknown, the attenuation coefficient mu—call it mu-zero or mu-one—for that pixel. By assumption, this pixel is homogeneous. With this simple argument, you now know mu for this right triangle. By the same argument, all the right-layer pixels can be directly measured with a prior flow of X-rays.\\n\\nOnce that is done, move to the next layer, colored green. Use a green X-ray. You know the incoming intensity and the attenuated intensity. You already know mu for the right element, and you also know mu for the current neighbor. Because you know these mu values, you can compute how the incoming intensity is attenuated and thus determine the incoming flux into the green pixel. You also know the attenuated intensity leaving this location. That attenuated intensity is the quantity just out of the green pixel but further attenuated by the right pixel. Using Beer’s law in reverse, you back out the intensity before that extra attenuation. Now you know the value here, you know the value there, and you know the total length, so you can resolve mu for this particular green triangular pixel. Likewise, each of the green elements is resolved.\\n\\nNext, move to the light-blue ray. At this point, the green and the right layers are known; only this one remaining element is unknown. The same heuristic applies.\\nThis argument ties the relations without complicated mathematics. Heuristically, you can peel the image layer by layer and resolve the underlying image algebraically. When you solve the linear system equation pixel-wise, you are essentially doing exactly this: layer by layer. In parallel-beam geometry, you can send all possible rays and reorder them so you effectively view the object from the outermost layer inward, resolving all unknowns layer by layer.

Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nThis is what I call the onion-peeling idea.\\u000b\\nThink of a picture and decompose it into a collection of pixels. The pixel does not have to be rectangular; here, I use triangular pixels. I perform the decomposition into many, many triangular pixels and then resolve the unknowns layer by layer. Start with the outermost unknowns, represented as a right triangle. This is a heuristic idea, so follow the logic.\\n\\nIn the limiting case, imagine the object support where an X-ray touches one molecule, an extremely small element. Take this as an example: you have a small material element. You know the incoming intensity, you know the attenuated intensity, and because the data are partitioned, you know the total path length. From these three knowns, you can resolve the only unknown, the attenuation coefficient mu—call it mu-zero or mu-one—for that pixel. By assumption, this pixel is homogeneous. With this simple argument, you now know mu for this right triangle. By the same argument, all the right-layer pixels can be directly measured with a prior flow of X-rays.\\n\\nOnce that is done, move to the next layer, colored green. Use a green X-ray. You know the incoming intensity and the attenuated intensity. You already know mu for the right element, and you also know mu for the current neighbor. Because you know these mu values, you can compute how the incoming intensity is attenuated and thus determine the incoming flux into the green pixel. You also know the attenuated intensity leaving this location. That attenuated intensity is the quantity just out of the green pixel but further attenuated by the right pixel. Using Beer’s law in reverse, you back out the intensity before that extra attenuation. Now you know the value here, you know the value there, and you know the total length, so you can resolve mu for this particular green triangular pixel. Likewise, each of the green elements is resolved.\\n\\nNext, move to the light-blue ray. At this point, the green and the right layers are known; only this one remaining element is unknown. The same heuristic applies.\\nThis argument ties the relations without complicated mathematics. Heuristically, you can peel the image layer by layer and resolve the underlying image algebraically. When you solve the linear system equation pixel-wise, you are essentially doing exactly this: layer by layer. In parallel-beam geometry, you can send all possible rays and reorder them so you effectively view the object from the outermost layer inward, resolving all unknowns layer by layer. This is the key argument.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only.
