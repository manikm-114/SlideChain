Later, we’ll learn how to calculate equivalent impedance for these different configurations. But the important takeaway here is that impedance unifies the behavior of resistors, capacitors, and inductors into one general concept, making AC circuit analysis much simpler.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only.
