They’re excellent for recognizing local patterns that repeat across space or time.\\nShortcut connections and feedback loops, inspired by control theory, can help stabilize training and improve learning in very deep networks.\\n\\nIn some cases, we even borrow ideas from game theory — for example, adversarial mechanisms like GANs, where two networks compete to improve each other.\\nAnd when we’re working with oscillations, waveforms, or electromagnetic signals, concepts from complex analysis — such as amplitude and phase — can be built directly into the network using complex-valued weights.\\n\\nThe takeaway here is that neural network design is not guesswork. It’s about choosing the right principles from mathematics and engineering, and embedding them into the architecture so that it’s well-matched to the problem at hand.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only.
