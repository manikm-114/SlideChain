You can think of multiplying by i as rotating a vector by 90 degrees in the complex plane. For example, if we start with the unit vector at 1 on the real axis and multiply by i, it rotates to point straight up along the imaginary axis.\\n\\nIf we multiply by i again — another 90-degree rotation — we end up at negative 1 on the real axis. In other words, i times i equals –1. That’s the origin of the idea that i is the square root of negative one.\\n\\nMore generally, multiplying by e to the i theta rotates a vector by an angle theta, while multiplying by a real number r simply scales its length.
