Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nBefore we dive into networks, let’s recall the two related ideas we’ve already discussed — functions and systems.\\u000b\\nA function is a mathematical concept. It takes an input, processes it according to some rule, and produces an output. You can think of it in terms of a domain and a range.\\u000bA system is essentially the same idea, but we often use this term in engineering. We talk about inputs and outputs, and the system could be simple or complex.\\n\\nNow, a network is really just a more complex kind of system — one made up of many interconnected subsystems. The internet is a perfect example: millions of computers linked together, exchanging information. From a mathematical perspective, you can think of a network as a very complicated function, often involving many variables and composite functions linked together.\\n\\nIn electrical engineering, we often study electrical networks, where components like resistors, capacitors, and inductors are connected to form a circuit. In modern artificial intelligence, we have neural networks, which connect many artificial neurons to process information — in some ways, similar to how biological neurons communicate through electrical signals in our nervous system.\\n\\nToday, we’ll start with the more classic engineering example: the electrical network.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only.
