Their voltage–current relationship does not form a straight line.\\nFor example, a diode only allows significant current to flow in one direction once the forward voltage reaches a certain threshold — about 0.7 volts for silicon and 0.3 volts for germanium.

By combining these gates, we can create flip-flops and sequential circuits, which store and manipulate digital information.\\n\\nNonlinear components make it possible to build amplifiers, oscillators, logic circuits, and microprocessors. They open the door to modern electronics — where linear analysis still plays a role, but must be combined with device-specific nonlinear behavior.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only.
