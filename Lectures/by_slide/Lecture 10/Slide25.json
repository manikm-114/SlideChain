On the left divider, we have resistors R 1 and R 2; on the right divider, we have resistors R 3 and R4. The output voltage, V_out, is measured between the midpoints of these two dividers.\\nIf the ratios of the resistors are chosen so that R 1 over R 2 equals R 4 over R 3, the two dividers produce exactly the same voltage at their midpoints, and V_out is zero. This is called the null mode — no signal at the output when the bridge is balanced.\\n\\nNow, if one of the resistors — typically R 3 — is actually a sensor whose resistance changes slightly, say from R knot to R knot times (1 plus x), the bridge becomes unbalanced. This small change in R 3 produces a nonzero V out, even though the original background voltage was canceled out.\\n\\nIn deflection mode, we can write V out as the supply voltage V c c multiplied by the difference between the left divider ratio and the right divider ratio. Because the bridge starts balanced, even a very small change in R 3 creates a measurable output.\\nThe advantage is that we’ve removed the large constant voltage and isolated only the change we care about.

Because the bridge starts balanced, even a very small change in R 3 creates a measurable output.\\nThe advantage is that we’ve removed the large constant voltage and isolated only the change we care about. This makes it possible to apply high gain to that small signal without saturating the system.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\\n- Add modalities [\\\"text\\\"] by default; add \\\"image\\\" only if clearly visible without the text.\\n- Confidence in [0,1].\\n\\nOUTPUT:\\n{\\n  \\\"triples\\\": [\\n    {\\\"s\\\":\\\"<verbatim subject>\\\", \\\"p\\\":\\\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\\\",\\n     \\\"o\\\":\\\"<verbatim object>\\\", \\\"modalities\\\":[\\\"text\\\",\\\"image\\\"], \\\"confidence\\\":0.0, \\\"evidence\\\":\\\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\\\"}\\n  ]\\n}\\n\\nassistant\\n{\\n  \\\"triples\\\": []\\n}\", \"parsed\": {\"triples\": []}}"
