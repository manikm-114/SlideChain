By training neural networks on large datasets — for example, the thousands of scans acquired every day in hospitals — the system can learn what a “clean” image should look like, without erasing important diagnostic details. Instead of throwing those routine scans away, we can use them to teach the network.\\nAs a result, we can transform a noisy scan into one that is much clearer, improving both diagnostic confidence and patient safety.\\nSo that’s the big picture — and we’ll wrap up here for today.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\\n- Add modalities [\\\"text\\\"] by default; add \\\"image\\\" only if clearly visible without the text.\\n- Confidence in [0,1].\\n\\nOUTPUT:\\n{\\n  \\\"triples\\\": [\\n    {\\\"s\\\":\\\"<verbatim subject>\\\", \\\"p\\\":\\\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\\\",\\n     \\\"o\\\":\\\"<verbatim object>\\\", \\\"modalities\\\":[\\\"text\\\",\\\"image\\\"], \\\"confidence\\\":0.0, \\\"evidence\\\":\\\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\\\"}\\n  ]\\n}\\n\\nassistant\\n{\\n  \\\"triples\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"s\\\": \\\"machine learning\\\",\\n      \\\"p\\\": \\\"reconstructs_with\\\",\\n      \\\"o\\\": \\\"raw data\\\",\\n      \\\"modalities\\\": [\\n        \\\"text\\\",\\n        \\\"image\\\"\\n      ],\\n      \\\"confidence\\\": 0.95,\\n      \\\"evidence\\\": \\\"we can train neural networks to directly generate high-quality images from the raw data itself\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"s\\\": \\\"neural networks\\\",\\n      \\\"p\\\": \\\"produces\\\",\\n      \\\"o\\\": \\\"high-quality images\\\",\\n      \\\"modalities\\\": [\\n        \\\"text\\\",\\n        \\\"image\\\"\\n      ],\\n      \\\"confidence\\\": 0.9,\\n      \\\"evidence\\\": \\\"train neural networks to directly generate high-quality images\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"s\\\": \\\"neural networks\\\",\\n      \\\"p\\\": \\\"uses\\\",\\n      \\\"o\\\": \\\"large datasets\\\",\\n      \\\"modalities\\\": [\\n        \\\"text\\\",\\n        \\\"image\\\"\\n      ],\\n      \\\"confidence\\\": 0.85,\\n      \\\"evidence\\\": \\\"By training neural networks on large datasets\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"s\\\": \\\"machine learning\\\",\\n      \\\"p\\\": \\\"measures\\\",\\n      \\\"o\\\": \\\"signal-to-noise ratio\\\",\\n      \\\"\", \"parsed\": {\"s\": \"neural networks\", \"p\": \"uses\", \"o\": \"large datasets\", \"modalities\": [\"text\", \"image\"], \"confidence\": 0.85, \"evidence\": [\"By training neural networks on large datasets\"]}}"
