It was led by Demis Hassabis, the co-founder and CEO of DeepMind — one of the world’s leading AI companies, later acquired by Google.\\n\\nI listened to several fascinating presentations. The speakers shared breakthroughs in AI research, from neuroscience-inspired architectures to game-playing systems that were pushing the limits of machine learning. The atmosphere was electric — you could feel that this was more than just incremental progress.\\n\\nThat afternoon convinced me of something important: AI had truly entered a revolutionary stage. The technology was no longer just an academic curiosity; it was becoming a powerful tool with transformative potential, ready to impact science, healthcare, and our understanding of the human mind. It was clear that an exciting new era was unfolding.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only.
