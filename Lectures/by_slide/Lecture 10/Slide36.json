The dendrites act like antennas, receiving incoming signals from other neurons. These signals travel toward the cell body, which contains the nucleus and all the essential cellular machinery to keep the neuron alive and functioning.\\nFrom the cell body, information is sent down a long projection called the axon. This is essentially the neuron’s transmission cable, carrying electrical signals — known as action potentials — toward the axon terminals. Along the way, the signal may be sped up by segments of myelin sheath, which act as insulation.\\n\\nAt the axon terminals, the neuron communicates with its target cells — which could be other neurons, muscle fibers, or glands — across small gaps called synapses. Communication here happens chemically, through the release of neurotransmitters, or in some cases, electrically.\\n\\nThe important thing to remember is that neurons are not just passive wires.
