Unlike linear systems, nonlinear equations are often difficult, or even impossible, to solve exactly. But thanks to modern computing, we can discretize these equations and compute solutions numerically—even if we have to do so through brute force.\\nBeyond practical applications, nonlinear systems are fascinating because they produce surprising, often counterintuitive phenomena. And anything that defies our intuition naturally grabs our interest.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only.
