As shown in this diagram, you can see the different behaviors that occur when light reaches the surface of tissue. There’s the incident light, which hits the surface, and part of it gets reflected right away. Some of the light, however, penetrates into the tissue and becomes refracted light. Inside the tissue, that light can undergo scattering — bouncing around in different directions. Some of the scattered photons may come back out, which we call remitted light, while others continue to travel through and emerge as transmitted light.\\n\\nThese are the basic mechanisms of light–tissue interaction. You can think of them as reflection, scattering, and transmission. When we send a beam of light into a piece of tissue, some of that light just passes straight through, continuing in roughly the same direction — that’s the transmitted portion. The rest is either reflected or scattered randomly. The light intensity that we detect decreases as the beam travels deeper, and that attenuation happens because of two main effects — absorption and scattering.\\n\\nAbsorption means that some of the light energy is absorbed by the tissue and converted into heat. Scattering, on the other hand, means that photons are deflected from their original path in different directions. Together, absorption and scattering reduce the intensity of the transmitted beam — very much like what happens in X-ray imaging. So, when we think about optical imaging, we’re dealing with these same physical ideas — transmission, absorption, scattering, and reflection — but now in the visible and near-infrared light range, where tissue behaves quite differently.\\n\\nSo in summary, when you shine light into biological material, part of it is reflected, part of it penetrates and scatters, and part of it is absorbed. The balance among these processes depends on the tissue thickness and optical properties. These interactions are the foundation of optical imaging and determine how deeply light can penetrate and what kind of information we can obtain about biological structures.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only.

Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nNow let’s talk about how light interacts with biological tissue.\\u000b\\nJust like X-rays interact with the human body in medical imaging, visible light also interacts with biological tissues similarly. As shown in this diagram, you can see the different behaviors that occur when light reaches the surface of tissue. There’s the incident light, which hits the surface, and part of it gets reflected right away. Some of the light, however, penetrates into the tissue and becomes refracted light. Inside the tissue, that light can undergo scattering — bouncing around in different directions. Some of the scattered photons may come back out, which we call remitted light, while others continue to travel through and emerge as transmitted light.\\n\\nThese are the basic mechanisms of light–tissue interaction. You can think of them as reflection, scattering, and transmission. When we send a beam of light into a piece of tissue, some of that light just passes straight through, continuing in roughly the same direction — that’s the transmitted portion. The rest is either reflected or scattered randomly. The light intensity that we detect decreases as the beam travels deeper, and that attenuation happens because of two main effects — absorption and scattering.\\n\\nAbsorption means that some of the light energy is absorbed by the tissue and converted into heat. Scattering, on the other hand, means that photons are deflected from their original path in different directions. Together, absorption and scattering reduce the intensity of the transmitted beam — very much like what happens in X-ray imaging. So, when we think about optical imaging, we’re dealing with these same physical ideas — transmission, absorption, scattering, and reflection — but now in the visible and near-infrared light range, where tissue behaves quite differently.\\n\\nSo in summary, when you shine light into biological material, part of it is reflected, part of it penetrates and scatters, and part of it is absorbed. The balance among these processes depends on the tissue thickness and optical properties. These interactions are the foundation of optical imaging and determine how deeply light can penetrate and what kind of information we can obtain about biological structures.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only.
