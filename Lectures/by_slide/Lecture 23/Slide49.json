We know that X-rays can penetrate deeply into tissue, and we also know that nanophosphors can convert X-rays into visible light. So, what if we could use X-rays as a remote light source to activate optogenetic proteins deep inside the brain?\\n\\nHere’s how it would work. We inject nanophosphors small enough to pass through the blood–brain barrier — so they can distribute evenly within the brain tissue. Then, we shine a focused X-ray beam into a specific region. The nanophosphors there absorb the X-rays and emit light locally — right where the neurons are.\\n\\nThat emitted light can then activate the optogenetic channels — just like in traditional optogenetics, but now without inserting any optical fibers. Everything is done noninvasively.\\nIn our paper, we discussed this as a possible future imaging and neurostimulation technique. One of my undergraduate students — who is now working full-time on this — helped develop the idea. We’re currently characterizing different nanophosphor materials, testing their emission spectra, decay times, and compatibility with biological tissue.\\n\\nThis concept could open the door to deep-brain stimulation without surgery, combining the precision of optogenetics with the penetration of X-rays.

We know that X-rays can penetrate deeply into tissue, and we also know that nanophosphors can convert X-rays into visible light. So, what if we could use X-rays as a remote light source to activate optogenetic proteins deep inside the brain?\\n\\nHere’s how it would work. We inject nanophosphors small enough to pass through the blood–brain barrier — so they can distribute evenly within the brain tissue. Then, we shine a focused X-ray beam into a specific region. The nanophosphors there absorb the X-rays and emit light locally — right where the neurons are.\\n\\nThat emitted light can then activate the optogenetic channels — just like in traditional optogenetics, but now without inserting any optical fibers. Everything is done noninvasively.\\nIn our paper, we discussed this as a possible future imaging and neurostimulation technique.
