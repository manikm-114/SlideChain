In our lab, we once developed one of the fastest numerical simulators of its kind — it’s called a tetrahedron-based, inhomogeneous Monte Carlo optical simulator. Quite a mouthful, right?

We place a small bioluminescent light source — say, something glowing inside the mouse — and then we let it emit photons. Those photons scatter through the tissue, and our simulator tracks where they go and how much light reaches the surface.\\n\\nOn the right, you can see the simulated fluence maps, color-coded to show photon density. The color bar on the side tells you how strong the signal is — from deep blue, meaning very few photons, up through green, yellow, and bright red, meaning a high photon density. It’s quite beautiful when you think about it: millions of photons bouncing, scattering, being absorbed — and yet out of all that chaos, you can reconstruct where the light came from inside the body.\\n\\nThis simulator was developed in our group, and I’m proud to say this work has become foundational. In fact, my former student, Qing-Sung, who worked on this, recently got a fantastic offer from Google to continue research in machine learning.

In our lab, we once developed one of the fastest numerical simulators of its kind — it’s called a tetrahedron-based, inhomogeneous Monte Carlo optical simulator. Quite a mouthful, right? But what it really means is that we used a mesh made of small tetrahedral elements to simulate photon transport in realistic biological tissue.\\n\\nHere, you see a simulated mouse model. It’s not just a cartoon — it’s a detailed anatomical mesh. You can see the heart, lungs, liver, stomach, spleen, and kidneys, all represented as separate organs with different optical properties. We place a small bioluminescent light source — say, something glowing inside the mouse — and then we let it emit photons. Those photons scatter through the tissue, and our simulator tracks where they go and how much light reaches the surface.\\n\\nOn the right, you can see the simulated fluence maps, color-coded to show photon density. The color bar on the side tells you how strong the signal is — from deep blue, meaning very few photons, up through green, yellow, and bright red, meaning a high photon density. It’s quite beautiful when you think about it: millions of photons bouncing, scattering, being absorbed — and yet out of all that chaos, you can reconstruct where the light came from inside the body.\\n\\nThis simulator was developed in our group, and I’m proud to say this work has become foundational. In fact, my former student, Qing-Sung, who worked on this, recently got a fantastic offer from Google to continue research in machine learning. So you can see how the skills we learn here — simulation, modeling, and data interpretation — connect to cutting-edge fields. It’s not just physics, it’s computation, it’s innovation. This is the kind of work that combines optical science, biology, and computing into something truly powerful.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only.
