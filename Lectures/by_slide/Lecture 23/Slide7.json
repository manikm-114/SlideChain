From the following slide text,\\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nNow, in addition to scattering and absorption, we also have another very important mechanism called fluorescence.\\u000bIn X-ray imaging, we already know about X-ray fluorescence — when we send X-rays into a material, they can produce secondary X-rays with different energies. Similarly, in optical imaging, we can have fluorescence in the visible range. Certain biological molecules or engineered proteins can absorb light of one color and emit light of another color with a longer wavelength.\\n\\nFor example, proteins can be tagged with fluorescent markers. One of the most famous is the green fluorescent protein, or GFP. When you genetically attach GFP to a specific protein — let’s say to liprin or another biomolecule — they form a pair. The biological part represents your target or biomarker, and GFP serves as the fluorescent reporter. When you shine a blue laser light — about 488 nanometers in wavelength — onto this combination, the GFP absorbs the blue light and emits bright green light. So, when you see that green fluorescence, you know where your biomarker is located.\\n\\nIn other words, by detecting the emitted fluorescence, you can infer the spatial distribution of your biological target. This is the basic principle behind fluorescence imaging. You can even design these proteins so that they target different molecules — for instance, one may emit green, another red, another yellow — allowing you to track multiple biological processes at once. This kind of optical labeling gives you the ability to visualize molecular events inside living systems in real time.\\n\\nFluorescence is a very powerful concept. It lets us do what we call “bio-design.” Using genetic and bioengineering tools, we can attach different fluorescent proteins — green, pink, red — to different biomolecules. When those molecules move or react inside a cell, we can literally see where and when they act, based on the color of light emitted.\\n\\nThis work was so groundbreaking that it earned a Nobel Prize, awarded to several researchers from Japan and California who helped develop and refine these fluorescent proteins. With fluorescence imaging, we can observe living biological systems directly — not just fixed samples. We simply illuminate the sample with the appropriate light to excite the fluorescent probe, and then detect the emitted light, which is usually at a longer wavelength. Both the excitation and emission are in the visible range, making it easy to detect and analyze.\\n\\nSo overall, fluorescence enables us to perform cellular and molecular imaging in a very direct, intuitive way. You can send in light, stimulate the fluorophore, and watch as it emits a different color of light — giving you a real-time window into biological activity. This is the essence of fluorescence, and it forms one of the most important foundations of modern optical imaging.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only.

Certain biological molecules or engineered proteins can absorb light of one color and emit light of another color with a longer wavelength.\\n\\nFor example, proteins can be tagged with fluorescent markers. One of the most famous is the green fluorescent protein, or GFP. When you genetically attach GFP to a specific protein — let’s say to liprin or another biomolecule — they form a pair. The biological part represents your target or biomarker, and GFP serves as the fluorescent reporter. When you shine a blue laser light — about 488 nanometers in wavelength — onto this combination, the GFP absorbs the blue light and emits bright green light. So, when you see that green fluorescence, you know where your biomarker is located.\\n\\nIn other words, by detecting the emitted fluorescence, you can infer the spatial distribution of your biological target. This is the basic principle behind fluorescence imaging. You can even design these proteins so that they target different molecules — for instance, one may emit green, another red, another yellow — allowing you to track multiple biological processes at once. This kind of optical labeling gives you the ability to visualize molecular events inside living systems in real time.\\n\\nFluorescence is a very powerful concept. It lets us do what we call “bio-design.” Using genetic and bioengineering tools, we can attach different fluorescent proteins — green, pink, red — to different biomolecules. When those molecules move or react inside a cell, we can literally see where and when they act, based on the color of light emitted.\\n\\nThis work was so groundbreaking that it earned a Nobel Prize, awarded to several researchers from Japan and California who helped develop and refine these fluorescent proteins. With fluorescence imaging, we can observe living biological systems directly — not just fixed samples. We simply illuminate the sample with the appropriate light to excite the fluorescent probe, and then detect the emitted light, which is usually at a longer wavelength. Both the excitation and emission are in the visible range, making it easy to detect and analyze.\\n\\nSo overall, fluorescence enables us to perform cellular and molecular imaging in a very direct, intuitive way. You can send in light, stimulate the fluorophore, and watch as it emits a different color of light — giving you a real-time window into biological activity. This is the essence of fluorescence, and it forms one of the most important foundations of modern optical imaging.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only.
