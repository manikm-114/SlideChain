Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nNow, we’ve just learned about ultrasound, and we’ve also talked about confocal microscopy — so let’s put them into context.\\u000bAs you can see in this comparison plot, confocal microscopy gives us excellent resolution — down to about one micron — but the penetration depth of visible light is quite limited. Optical light simply can’t penetrate very deeply into tissue. For example, if I shine a light on my hand, you can’t see it clearly through the other side. Human tissue isn’t optically transparent, so the light is mostly scattered or absorbed before it can travel far.\\n\\nOn the other hand, ultrasound penetrates much deeper — several centimeters, even up to tens of meters in other contexts. That’s why it’s such a powerful clinical imaging tool for viewing inside the body. But its resolution is much lower than that of optical methods — typically in the range of hundreds of micrometers.\\n\\nSo, what about optical coherence tomography (OCT)? OCT sits right in between these two techniques. It offers resolution close to that of confocal microscopy — on the order of a few micrometers — but with a much greater imaging depth, typically a few millimeters. That’s what makes OCT so useful: it bridges the gap between high-resolution optical imaging and deep-penetrating ultrasound.\\n\\nThese three — ultrasound, confocal microscopy, and OCT — form the most clinically and biologically relevant imaging modalities for soft tissue. They’re not just theoretical; they’re widely used, well-established, and extremely powerful in both research and clinical applications.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only.
