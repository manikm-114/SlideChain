From the following slide text,\\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nNow, I mentioned optical path several times, so let’s take a moment to understand what I actually mean by that. Suppose you have coherent light — right light that is coherent means all the waves maintain a fixed phase relationship with one another. This light can include multiple colors or wavelengths — red, orange, green, purple, and so on — each with its own wavelength, lambda one, lambda two, lambda three, and so on. So, when you look at this broadband light, it’s really a mix of many slightly different frequencies that are all still coherent enough to interfere with each other.\\n\\nNow, imagine this light entering an interferometer setup. The light from the source first hits a beam splitter. This beam splitter is partially transparent, meaning part of the light passes straight through while the rest is reflected upward. That splits the beam into two optical paths. The first beam passes through the splitter, hits a fixed mirror — which is a perfect reflector — bounces back, passes through the beam splitter again, and goes down to the detector. That’s path one. The second beam, the reflected one, travels upward to a movable mirror, also a perfect reflector. It bounces back down, and because the beam splitter is semi-transparent, some of that returning light passes through to the same photodetector. That’s path two.\\n\\nSo, now you have two optical paths — one fixed, one adjustable — and the light from both paths recombines at the detector. If those two paths are the same length, the two beams arrive perfectly in phase, meaning their peaks and valleys line up. When that happens, they interfere constructively, and the total signal at the detector is at its maximum. But if you move that movable mirror by half a wavelength, the light in one arm travels a little farther, and the two waves arrive completely out of phase — one is at a peak while the other is at a trough. They cancel each other out, and the detector sees zero intensity. So, by moving that mirror just a tiny bit — even by half a wavelength — you can make the signal go from bright to dark. This is the basic principle of interferometric measurement.\\n\\nMathematically, this is described by the formula we derived earlier, which follows that same “one plus cosine” relationship. The cosine term represents the phase modulation, and the argument of that cosine depends on the difference in optical path length multiplied by the frequency of the light. That product — the path difference times the frequency — gives you the phase angle. So, for a single wavelength, say the red light, the signal can be written as I equals two I naught times one plus cosine of two pi delta L times nu. Now, if you use several wavelengths — orange, green, purple — each will have its own cosine term because each frequency is slightly different.\\n\\nSince light interference is a linear process, you can add all these contributions together. When you do that, you get a sum of cosine terms, each oscillating at slightly different frequencies. The overall signal, therefore, looks like a modulated waveform — a burst of interference fringes that fade in and out. If you had only one wavelength, you’d see a clean, continuous sine wave pattern of bright and dark fringes. But when you combine multiple wavelengths, the slightly different frequencies cause the waves to occasionally line up and then drift out of phase again. This creates the clustered or “envelope-shaped” interference pattern we often see in broadband interferometry.\\n\\nSo, the total intensity can be written as gamma of delta L equals two times the sum of I naught i times cosine of two pi delta L times nu i, where the sum is taken over all wavelengths. Each component is modulated by its own cosine term, and when all are added together, they form this envelope pattern. When the mirror is positioned such that all the wavelengths line up, you get strong constructive interference. As you move the mirror further, the wavelengths gradually fall out of phase, and the interference fades away.\\n\\nThis is the essential idea behind interference of coherent or partially coherent light. Two optical paths — one fixed and one movable — produce an interference signal that varies with the optical path difference. For multiple wavelengths, the pattern becomes modulated and forms an interference envelope. And by analyzing that envelope, you can precisely determine the optical path length difference. This concept forms the foundation for optical coherence tomography, where we use these interference patterns to extract depth information with extremely high precision.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only.

When that happens, they interfere constructively, and the total signal at the detector is at its maximum. But if you move that movable mirror by half a wavelength, the light in one arm travels a little farther, and the two waves arrive completely out of phase — one is at a peak while the other is at a trough. They cancel each other out, and the detector sees zero intensity. So, by moving that mirror just a tiny bit — even by half a wavelength — you can make the signal go from bright to dark. This is the basic principle of interferometric measurement.\\n\\nMathematically, this is described by the formula we derived earlier, which follows that same “one plus cosine” relationship. The cosine term represents the phase modulation, and the argument of that cosine depends on the difference in optical path length multiplied by the frequency of the light. That product — the path difference times the frequency — gives you the phase angle. So, for a single wavelength, say the red light, the signal can be written as I equals two I naught times one plus cosine of two pi delta L times nu. Now, if you use several wavelengths — orange, green, purple — each will have its own cosine term because each frequency is slightly different.\\n\\nSince light interference is a linear process, you can add all these contributions together. When you do that, you get a sum of cosine terms, each oscillating at slightly different frequencies. The overall signal, therefore, looks like a modulated waveform — a burst of interference fringes that fade in and out. If you had only one wavelength, you’d see a clean, continuous sine wave pattern of bright and dark fringes. But when you combine multiple wavelengths, the slightly different frequencies cause the waves to occasionally line up and then drift out of phase again. This creates the clustered or “envelope-shaped” interference pattern we often see in broadband interferometry.\\n\\nSo, the total intensity can be written as gamma of delta L equals two times the sum of I naught i times cosine of two pi delta L times nu i, where the sum is taken over all wavelengths. Each component is modulated by its own cosine term, and when all are added together, they form this envelope pattern. When the mirror is positioned such that all the wavelengths line up, you get strong constructive interference. As you move the mirror further, the wavelengths gradually fall out of phase, and the interference fades away.\\n\\nThis is the essential idea behind interference of coherent or partially coherent light. Two optical paths — one fixed and one movable — produce an interference signal that varies with the optical path difference. For multiple wavelengths, the pattern becomes modulated and forms an interference envelope. And by analyzing that envelope, you can precisely determine the optical path length difference. This concept forms the foundation for optical coherence tomography, where we use these interference patterns to extract depth information with extremely high precision.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only.

Suppose you have coherent light — right light that is coherent means all the waves maintain a fixed phase relationship with one another. This light can include multiple colors or wavelengths — red, orange, green, purple, and so on — each with its own wavelength, lambda one, lambda two, lambda three, and so on. So, when you look at this broadband light, it’s really a mix of many slightly different frequencies that are all still coherent enough to interfere with each other.\\n\\nNow, imagine this light entering an interferometer setup. The light from the source first hits a beam splitter. This beam splitter is partially transparent, meaning part of the light passes straight through while the rest is reflected upward. That splits the beam into two optical paths. The first beam passes through the splitter, hits a fixed mirror — which is a perfect reflector — bounces back, passes through the beam splitter again, and goes down to the detector. That’s path one. The second beam, the reflected one, travels upward to a movable mirror, also a perfect reflector. It bounces back down, and because the beam splitter is semi-transparent, some of that returning light passes through to the same photodetector. That’s path two.\\n\\nSo, now you have two optical paths — one fixed, one adjustable — and the light from both paths recombines at the detector. If those two paths are the same length, the two beams arrive perfectly in phase, meaning their peaks and valleys line up.
