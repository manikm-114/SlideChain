From the following slide text,\\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nNow, before I joined RPI, I was actually on the faculty at Virginia Tech and Wake Forest University, both at the medical school and the engineering school. I had laboratories on both campuses. And one of the major projects we worked on — a multi-million-dollar project — was about using optical molecular tomography to monitor blood vessel growth.\\nLet me explain the motivation behind it. When someone has cardiovascular disease, part of a blood vessel can get blocked — completely closed off by plaque buildup. Right now, the standard treatment is to insert a stent to reopen the vessel and restore blood flow. But as you know, stents come with their own problems — they can cause inflammation, thrombosis, and sometimes even re-narrowing of the artery over time.\\n\\nSo, the future solution that people are exploring is regenerative medicine — to actually grow a new biological blood vessel from your own stem cells. The idea is that we can take a small segment of your blood vessel, or even some of your cells, and grow a new vessel in the lab — a fully biological, living blood vessel that can eventually be implanted back into your body.\\n\\nTo do this, we use something called a bioreactor — a special device that maintains controlled conditions for growing tissue. Inside the bioreactor, you have this new blood vessel growing while nutrient-rich liquid continuously circulates it, simulating what happens inside the body.\\nNow, the question is — how do you monitor this growth process without destroying the tissue? That’s where our imaging technology comes in.\\nWe use OCT, or Optical Coherence Tomography, to capture the structural information — basically, the microscopic anatomy of the growing vessel. You can actually see the layers, the texture, and the thickness of the vessel wall.\\n\\nThen we combine that with fluorescence imaging to observe what’s happening at the cellular and molecular level. For example, using fluorescence probes, we can track whether endothelial cells — the cells that form the inner lining of blood vessels — are growing properly. That’s critical because without a strong endothelial layer, the vessel won’t be functional or stable.\\nSo, in our project, we integrated all these optical methods — OCT for structure, diffuse optical tomography for optical property recovery, and fluorescence tomography for molecular activity — all working together.\\n\\nThe advantage is that once you know both the structure and the optical properties of the tissue, you can use that information as a prior to improve the accuracy of fluorescence tomography. That means the reconstruction becomes more stable, more accurate, and better localized.\\nAnd since these vessels are much smaller than an entire small animal — just a few millimeters in diameter — the light can penetrate through them more easily. So we can actually achieve better resolution and depth information.\\n\\nThis whole system, combining multi-probe and multi-modal optical molecular tomography, was designed for regenerative medicine — specifically, to visualize and monitor bioengineered blood vessels both in the bioreactor and after implantation into living animals.\\nSo that’s what we did a number of years ago — a collaboration between my lab and my colleague, Dr. Shay Soker. It was supported by the NIH R01 BRP grant HL098912, running from 2010 to 2014. And that’s a really good example of how optical molecular imaging can move beyond small-animal studies toward real applications in regenerative medicine — imaging living tissue as it grows, heals, and integrates into the body.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only.

From the following slide text,\\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nNow, before I joined RPI, I was actually on the faculty at Virginia Tech and Wake Forest University, both at the medical school and the engineering school. I had laboratories on both campuses. And one of the major projects we worked on — a multi-million-dollar project — was about using optical molecular tomography to monitor blood vessel growth.\\nLet me explain the motivation behind it. When someone has cardiovascular disease, part of a blood vessel can get blocked — completely closed off by plaque buildup. Right now, the standard treatment is to insert a stent to reopen the vessel and restore blood flow. But as you know, stents come with their own problems — they can cause inflammation, thrombosis, and sometimes even re-narrowing of the artery over time.\\n\\nSo, the future solution that people are exploring is regenerative medicine — to actually grow a new biological blood vessel from your own stem cells. The idea is that we can take a small segment of your blood vessel, or even some of your cells, and grow a new vessel in the lab — a fully biological, living blood vessel that can eventually be implanted back into your body.\\n\\nTo do this, we use something called a bioreactor — a special device that maintains controlled conditions for growing tissue. Inside the bioreactor, you have this new blood vessel growing while nutrient-rich liquid continuously circulates it, simulating what happens inside the body.\\nNow, the question is — how do you monitor this growth process without destroying the tissue? That’s where our imaging technology comes in.\\nWe use OCT, or Optical Coherence Tomography, to capture the structural information — basically, the microscopic anatomy of the growing vessel. You can actually see the layers, the texture, and the thickness of the vessel wall.\\n\\nThen we combine that with fluorescence imaging to observe what’s happening at the cellular and molecular level. For example, using fluorescence probes, we can track whether endothelial cells — the cells that form the inner lining of blood vessels — are growing properly. That’s critical because without a strong endothelial layer, the vessel won’t be functional or stable.\\nSo, in our project, we integrated all these optical methods — OCT for structure, diffuse optical tomography for optical property recovery, and fluorescence tomography for molecular activity — all working together.\\n\\nThe advantage is that once you know both the structure and the optical properties of the tissue, you can use that information as a prior to improve the accuracy of fluorescence tomography. That means the reconstruction becomes more stable, more accurate, and better localized.\\nAnd since these vessels are much smaller than an entire small animal — just a few millimeters in diameter — the light can penetrate through them more easily. So we can actually achieve better resolution and depth information.\\n\\nThis whole system, combining multi-probe and multi-modal optical molecular tomography, was designed for regenerative medicine — specifically, to visualize and monitor bioengineered blood vessels both in the bioreactor and after implantation into living animals.\\nSo that’s what we did a number of years ago — a collaboration between my lab and my colleague, Dr. Shay Soker. It was supported by the NIH R01 BRP grant HL098912, running from 2010 to 2014.
