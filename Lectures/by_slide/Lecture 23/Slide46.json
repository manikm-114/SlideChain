From the following slide text,\\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nAlright, now let’s move on to something very exciting — X-ray micro-modulated luminescence tomography, or simply XMLT. This is one of the latest developments that builds upon everything we’ve discussed so far.\\n\\nIf you’re really interested, I recommend reading the original paper. But let me give you the idea in simple terms.\\nIn XMLT, we treat the X-ray beam as a wave, not just as a stream of particles. That means we can actually use certain X-ray optical components — things that already exist on the market, like X-ray polycapillary lenses. These are special lenses that can focus X-rays, although not quite as tightly as optical lenses can focus visible light. Still, they can concentrate the X-ray beam to a small spot — around 100 microns, or even smaller in some setups.\\nAnd because X-rays penetrate tissue so well, this focused beam can reach deep inside the object. So now, imagine we focus the X-ray into the tissue — we’re creating a tiny, well-defined excitation region.\\n\\nWhen we introduce nanophosphors into the sample — the same luminescent particles we talked about earlier — these particles light up only along the path of the focused X-ray beam. Everywhere else remains dark. That’s very important because it means the optical signal we collect corresponds precisely to the X-ray excitation path — no background interference from outside that region.\\nSo the spatial resolution of this imaging method is determined entirely by the X-ray focal spot size, by how small that beam is. Think of it like drawing with a very fine pen instead of a broad brush.\\n\\nAnd geometrically, this is not a pencil beam or a fan beam like in standard CT. It’s more like a double-cone beam — a cone that converges to a focus point and then diverges again. So you get a cone of excitation in both directions.\\nIn short, we perform tomography by collecting optical signals generated from these small, localized regions excited by the focused X-ray. We have published several papers on this topic, exploring the physics, the reconstruction algorithms, and the system design. It’s a fascinating direction for hybrid imaging research.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only.

This is one of the latest developments that builds upon everything we’ve discussed so far.\\n\\nIf you’re really interested, I recommend reading the original paper. But let me give you the idea in simple terms.\\nIn XMLT, we treat the X-ray beam as a wave, not just as a stream of particles. That means we can actually use certain X-ray optical components — things that already exist on the market, like X-ray polycapillary lenses. These are special lenses that can focus X-rays, although not quite as tightly as optical lenses can focus visible light. Still, they can concentrate the X-ray beam to a small spot — around 100 microns, or even smaller in some setups.\\nAnd because X-rays penetrate tissue so well, this focused beam can reach deep inside the object. So now, imagine we focus the X-ray into the tissue — we’re creating a tiny, well-defined excitation region.\\n\\nWhen we introduce nanophosphors into the sample — the same luminescent particles we talked about earlier — these particles light up only along the path of the focused X-ray beam. Everywhere else remains dark. That’s very important because it means the optical signal we collect corresponds precisely to the X-ray excitation path — no background interference from outside that region.\\nSo the spatial resolution of this imaging method is determined entirely by the X-ray focal spot size, by how small that beam is. Think of it like drawing with a very fine pen instead of a broad brush.\\n\\nAnd geometrically, this is not a pencil beam or a fan beam like in standard CT. It’s more like a double-cone beam — a cone that converges to a focus point and then diverges again. So you get a cone of excitation in both directions.\\nIn short, we perform tomography by collecting optical signals generated from these small, localized regions excited by the focused X-ray. We have published several papers on this topic, exploring the physics, the reconstruction algorithms, and the system design. It’s a fascinating direction for hybrid imaging research.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only.
