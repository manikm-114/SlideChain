Then, any signal you put into that system just passes through exactly as it is — unchanged. The system does nothing.\\u000bThis is an ideal system — it responds instantly and perfectly.\\n\\nFor example, if a camera had a perfect delta-function impulse response, every point in the scene would be captured exactly — with perfect sharpness, no blur at all.\\nBut in real life, that doesn’t happen. No camera has a true delta response.\\n\\nIn practical systems, the impulse response is not a delta function — it’s more spread out. That means the system blurs things.\\u000bEven if you feed it a sharp impulse, the output will be a wider, smeared version — not the same as the input.\\nSo what does that mean in the frequency domain?\\n\\nWell, we know that the Fourier transform of a delta function is a constant — it's just one everywhere.\\u000bThat’s because a delta contains all frequencies equally.\\nBut if your impulse response is not a delta — if it’s more spread out — then its Fourier transform won’t be constant.\\u000bIt will vary in frequency. That’s key.\\n\\nNow, let’s suppose you have some input signal — let’s call it i of t — and this signal goes into the system.\\u000bYou get an output o of t, and let’s say the output has the exact same shape as the input, just scaled by some number alpha.\\n\\nThat is:\\no of t equals alpha times i of t.\\nThat sounds simple, but let’s look at what it means in the frequency domain.\\nIf we take the Fourier transform of both sides, we get:\\nCapital O of u equals alpha times capital I of u.\\nBut from the convolution theorem, we also know:\\nCapital O of u equals capital H of u times capital I of u.\\nIf we compare those two expressions, we find:\\nCapital H of u must equal alpha — a constant.\\nBut as we just said, that would only be possible if h of t — the impulse response — is a delta function.\\u000bAnd we assumed it's not.\\nSo we have a contradiction.\\n\\nThat tells us:\\u000bNo function other than a sinusoid can go through a general shift-invariant linear system and come out with the same shape — unless the system is trivial, like an ideal delta.\\nOnly sinusoids have this amazing property:\\u000bSinusoid in, sinusoid out — same frequency, just scaled and shifted in phase.\\nThat’s what makes them so special in Fourier analysis.\\u000bThat’s why convolution in the time domain becomes multiplication in the frequency domain — because the system affects each sinusoidal component independently and proportionally.\\n\\nSo what you see here is not just a bunch of equations — it’s a deeper logic behind the theorem.\\u000bUnderstanding this helps you move beyond just memorizing formulas — it helps you truly see why Fourier analysis works the way it does.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only.
