From the following slide text,\\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nNow let’s take a moment to talk about an important concept in signal processing — the comb function and how it behaves under the Fourier transform.\\n\\nLet’s start with this equation at the top. It says:\\ns of t equals the sum over all n of delta of t minus n times capital T.\\nThis is what we call a delta train or comb function in the time domain. It’s a series of impulses, evenly spaced by T units.\\nNow, when we take the Fourier transform of this comb, something very elegant happens.\\nIt becomes another comb — but in the frequency domain.\\n\\nSpecifically, the transform is:\\ns of f equals one over capital T times the sum over all n of delta of f minus n over capital T.\\nSo, in words, a comb in time with spacing T becomes a comb in frequency with spacing 1 over T. And we get a scaling factor of 1 over T in front.\\nThis is a fundamental symmetry in Fourier analysis: when a signal is periodic in time, its spectrum is discrete in frequency — and vice versa.\\n\\nNow look at the plots in the middle of the slide.\\nOn the left side, we see a train of impulses spaced T apart along the time axis. On the right, we have the corresponding Fourier transform — another train of impulses but now spaced 1 over T along the frequency axis.\\nSo there’s this beautiful reciprocal relationship: if your delta train is spaced T in time, its Fourier counterpart is spaced 1 over T in frequency.\\nAnd this brings us to the red box at the bottom of the slide. These equations generalize the idea.\\n\\nLet’s say you have a sum of delta functions shifted by n over P. That’s a comb with spacing 1 over P.\\nThen, its Fourier transform becomes P times a sum of delta functions spaced P apart. The scaling factor flips — one becomes P, and the spacing flips from 1 over P to P.\\nAnd if we put a scaling factor of 1 over P in front of the comb, then the Fourier transform is simply a comb with spacing P, with no extra scaling factor.\\nSo again, delta trains are their own Fourier transforms — up to a scaling and spacing change.\\n\\nThis property is essential when we talk about sampling, because whenever we sample a signal, we’re essentially multiplying it by a comb function in time. And that multiplication creates repeated spectra in the frequency domain — spaced according to the sampling rate.\\nSo that’s the comb and its mirror — one of the most powerful dualities in Fourier theory.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only.

It says:\\ns of t equals the sum over all n of delta of t minus n times capital T.\\nThis is what we call a delta train or comb function in the time domain. It’s a series of impulses, evenly spaced by T units.\\nNow, when we take the Fourier transform of this comb, something very elegant happens.\\nIt becomes another comb — but in the frequency domain.\\n\\nSpecifically, the transform is:\\ns of f equals one over capital T times the sum over all n of delta of f minus n over capital T.\\nSo, in words, a comb in time with spacing T becomes a comb in frequency with spacing 1 over T. And we get a scaling factor of 1 over T in front.\\nThis is a fundamental symmetry in Fourier analysis: when a signal is periodic in time, its spectrum is discrete in frequency — and vice versa.\\n\\nNow look at the plots in the middle of the slide.\\nOn the left side, we see a train of impulses spaced T apart along the time axis. On the right, we have the corresponding Fourier transform — another train of impulses but now spaced 1 over T along the frequency axis.\\nSo there’s this beautiful reciprocal relationship: if your delta train is spaced T in time, its Fourier counterpart is spaced 1 over T in frequency.\\nAnd this brings us to the red box at the bottom of the slide. These equations generalize the idea.\\n\\nLet’s say you have a sum of delta functions shifted by n over P. That’s a comb with spacing 1 over P.\\nThen, its Fourier transform becomes P times a sum of delta functions spaced P apart. The scaling factor flips — one becomes P, and the spacing flips from 1 over P to P.\\nAnd if we put a scaling factor of 1 over P in front of the comb, then the Fourier transform is simply a comb with spacing P, with no extra scaling factor.\\nSo again, delta trains are their own Fourier transforms — up to a scaling and spacing change.\\n\\nThis property is essential when we talk about sampling, because whenever we sample a signal, we’re essentially multiplying it by a comb function in time. And that multiplication creates repeated spectra in the frequency domain — spaced according to the sampling rate.\\nSo that’s the comb and its mirror — one of the most powerful dualities in Fourier theory.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only.
