From the following slide text,\\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nLet’s take a step back now and look at how analog signals are converted to digital.\\nAt the top, we have a smooth, continuous signal — this is your analog signal — represented here as f of t, where t is time.\\n\\nNow, to digitize this signal, we begin with the process of sampling. In the middle plot, you see a train of delta functions — these are evenly spaced impulses in time. Each one of them marks a point where we will sample the analog signal.\\n\\nNext, what do we do?\\nWe multiply the continuous signal by this train of impulses. That’s shown in the bottom figure.\\nThis multiplication essentially picks out the values of the original signal at those discrete time points — and sets everything else to zero.
