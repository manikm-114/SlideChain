It suppresses the values at the edges and emphasizes the center part of the signal.\\nThe result, shown on the right, is a conditioned signal. It’s still based on the original data, but now it’s more concentrated, more stable, and less prone to causing problems downstream.\\n\\nThis process is called conditioning — and in the spatial domain, it’s done by pointwise multiplication. We’re not changing the signal globally — just shaping it locally to make it behave better.\\nThis idea becomes even more powerful when we look at its effect in the frequency domain — and that’s where we’re headed next.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only.
