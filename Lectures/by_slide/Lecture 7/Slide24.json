From the following slide text,\\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nNow let’s see why we’re often better off working in the frequency domain.\\nSuppose we start with a nicely concentrated spectrum — something like the narrow peak shown on the left. This means our signal in the spatial domain is smooth and well-behaved.\\n\\nNow, when we sample the signal — which, in the frequency domain, corresponds to a convolution with a delta train — we generate copies of this spectrum. These appear periodically across the frequency axis. You can see a central copy and two others on either side.\\nIf the original spectrum is narrow enough, these copies won’t overlap — and that’s a key idea. No overlap means no aliasing. That’s good news.\\n\\nIn this case, we can use a low-pass filter to isolate the central copy and discard the rest. This makes it possible to perfectly reconstruct the original signal from its samples.\\n\\nThat’s why frequency domain analysis is so powerful — it gives us a clear way to understand, diagnose, and even fix sampling-related problems. And it’s where the idea of an ideal sampling filter comes in. This filter selects only what we need and suppresses what we don’t.\\nWe’ll explore this concept even further as we continue.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only.
