It tells us that a function of t — written as f of t — can be expressed as a sum over many terms.\\nMathematically, this is written as:\\nf of t equals the sum from n equals negative infinity to positive infinity, of c  n times e to the power 2 pi i n t over capital T.\\nEach term in the sum is a complex exponential — and each coefficient, c  n, tells us how much of that particular frequency component is present in the signal.\\n\\nNow how do we calculate these coefficients?\\nWe use the formula:\\nc  n equals 1 over capital T, times the integral from 0 to capital T, of f of t multiplied by e to the power negative 2 pi i n t over capital T, d t.\\nSo what we’re doing here is projecting the function f of t onto a basis function — that basis is the complex exponential. This is very much like taking an inner product between vectors.\\n\\nYou can think of the function as living in a high-dimensional space — in fact, infinitely many dimensions. Each basis function spans one of those directions. So when we compute c  n, we’re measuring how much f of t points in the direction of that basis function.\\nNow, what if the function isn’t periodic, or the period becomes very large?\\nThat’s where the Fourier transform comes in.\\n\\nInstead of summing over discrete frequencies, we move to a continuous frequency variable, often called s.\\nThe Fourier transform of f of t is written as f hat of s, and it’s defined as:\\nThe integral from negative infinity to positive infinity, of f of t times e to the power negative 2 pi i s t, d t.\\nTo recover the original function, we use the inverse Fourier transform, which is:\\nf of t equals the integral from negative infinity to positive infinity, of f hat of s times e to the power 2 pi i s t, d s.\\n\\nSo you can see — when we move from a periodic function with period capital T, to a general function as T approaches infinity, the Fourier series becomes the Fourier transform.\\nThis is a very elegant transition — from a discrete sum to a continuous integral — and it forms the basis of much of signal processing.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only.

From the following slide text,\\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nNow let’s talk more specifically about how a function can be represented using the Fourier series or the Fourier transform.\\n\\nAt the top, we see a Fourier series representation. It tells us that a function of t — written as f of t — can be expressed as a sum over many terms.\\nMathematically, this is written as:\\nf of t equals the sum from n equals negative infinity to positive infinity, of c  n times e to the power 2 pi i n t over capital T.\\nEach term in the sum is a complex exponential — and each coefficient, c  n, tells us how much of that particular frequency component is present in the signal.\\n\\nNow how do we calculate these coefficients?\\nWe use the formula:\\nc  n equals 1 over capital T, times the integral from 0 to capital T, of f of t multiplied by e to the power negative 2 pi i n t over capital T, d t.\\nSo what we’re doing here is projecting the function f of t onto a basis function — that basis is the complex exponential. This is very much like taking an inner product between vectors.\\n\\nYou can think of the function as living in a high-dimensional space — in fact, infinitely many dimensions. Each basis function spans one of those directions. So when we compute c  n, we’re measuring how much f of t points in the direction of that basis function.\\nNow, what if the function isn’t periodic, or the period becomes very large?\\nThat’s where the Fourier transform comes in.\\n\\nInstead of summing over discrete frequencies, we move to a continuous frequency variable, often called s.\\nThe Fourier transform of f of t is written as f hat of s, and it’s defined as:\\nThe integral from negative infinity to positive infinity, of f of t times e to the power negative 2 pi i s t, d t.\\nTo recover the original function, we use the inverse Fourier transform, which is:\\nf of t equals the integral from negative infinity to positive infinity, of f hat of s times e to the power 2 pi i s t, d s.\\n\\nSo you can see — when we move from a periodic function with period capital T, to a general function as T approaches infinity, the Fourier series becomes the Fourier transform.\\nThis is a very elegant transition — from a discrete sum to a continuous integral — and it forms the basis of much of signal processing.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only.
