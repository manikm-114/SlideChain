In the frequency domain, that multiplication becomes a convolution.\\n\\nHere’s what happens:\\nOn the left, we have the original signal’s spectrum — a smooth curve that shows how the energy is spread across different frequencies.\\nIn the center, we see a train of delta functions. These represent the periodic sampling pattern in the time domain.\\nWhen we convolve the original spectrum with this delta train, what we get is shown on the right: multiple shifted copies of the original spectrum. One in the center, and others repeated at regular intervals to the left and right. These are called spectral replicas.\\n\\nNow, this setup is fine if the copies don’t overlap. But in the case shown here, the original spectrum is wide — it spreads across many frequencies — and the spacing between these delta peaks is not large enough. So the replicas overlap, and this overlap is what causes aliasing.\\n\\nAliasing is when different frequency components get mixed together. It’s like solving the equation x plus y equals 10,  you can't tell how much is x and how much is y. Similarly, when spectra overlap, you lose the ability to tell which part of the signal came from which frequency. That’s a problem.\\n\\nSo to avoid aliasing, we need to space those spectral copies far enough apart — which means we need a high enough sampling rate in the time domain.

From the following slide text,\\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nNow let’s move to the frequency domain and see what sampling looks like there.\\nEarlier, we saw that sampling in the spatial or time domain means multiplying the signal by an impulse train. In the frequency domain, that multiplication becomes a convolution.\\n\\nHere’s what happens:\\nOn the left, we have the original signal’s spectrum — a smooth curve that shows how the energy is spread across different frequencies.\\nIn the center, we see a train of delta functions. These represent the periodic sampling pattern in the time domain.\\nWhen we convolve the original spectrum with this delta train, what we get is shown on the right: multiple shifted copies of the original spectrum. One in the center, and others repeated at regular intervals to the left and right. These are called spectral replicas.\\n\\nNow, this setup is fine if the copies don’t overlap. But in the case shown here, the original spectrum is wide — it spreads across many frequencies — and the spacing between these delta peaks is not large enough. So the replicas overlap, and this overlap is what causes aliasing.\\n\\nAliasing is when different frequency components get mixed together. It’s like solving the equation x plus y equals 10,  you can't tell how much is x and how much is y. Similarly, when spectra overlap, you lose the ability to tell which part of the signal came from which frequency. That’s a problem.\\n\\nSo to avoid aliasing, we need to space those spectral copies far enough apart — which means we need a high enough sampling rate in the time domain. That ensures each frequency copy stays separate, and the original signal can be recovered accurately.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only.
