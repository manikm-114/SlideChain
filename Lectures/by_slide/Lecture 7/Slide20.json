We’re only picking up a few values. And when we try to reconstruct the signal, shown on the right, we get something much smoother and simpler than the original. It might even look okay at first glance, but it’s actually wrong.\\n\\nAll that detail — all the fast oscillations — is lost. Even worse, the reconstructed version can look like a completely different signal, with a false shape or even the wrong frequency.\\nThis is what we call aliasing. It happens when the sampling rate is too low to capture the higher-frequency components. And once they’re lost, you can’t recover them from the sampled data.\\nThat’s why choosing the right sampling rate is so critical in signal processing.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only.
