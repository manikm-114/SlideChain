Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nTo wrap up our discussion, let’s take a closer look at this final visual — it ties everything together beautifully.\\nAt the top, we see a simple rectangular function, labeled f of x. It’s a block function centered at zero. Next to it is h of x, which is a train of two delta functions — one at minus a over two and the other at plus a over two. Their amplitudes are scaled by one-half.\\n\\nNow, when we convolve f of x with h of x, the result — g of x — is essentially just two shifted copies of the original function. Each delta acts like a copying machine, reproducing f of x at the location of the delta. This is a perfect illustration of how convolution with delta functions results in replicated versions of a signal.\\n\\nNow let’s look at the bottom half of the slide — we’re moving into the frequency domain.\\nThe Fourier transform of the original block function, f of x, becomes a smooth sinc-like curve, F of k. The delta train, h of x, transforms into a cosine wave pattern, H of k. And the product in the frequency domain, F of k times H of k, gives us G of k — a modulated version of the original Fourier transform.\\nThis shows us that convolution in the time domain becomes multiplication in the frequency domain — one of the central results of Fourier theory.\\n\\nNow, relating this back to the sampling theorem...\\nWhen we sample a continuous signal, we are essentially multiplying it by a train of delta functions. In the time domain, this multiplication picks out the values at those sampling points. But in the frequency domain, it leads to repetitions — or aliases — of the original spectrum.\\nAnd when we reconstruct, we don't use the simple rectangle anymore — instead, we use the sinc function, which is the Fourier transform of an ideal low-pass filter. But the principle is the same: the delta functions trigger copies, and these copies are scaled by the actual sample values — f of k over P.\\n\\nAnd here’s the key takeaway:\\nIf we sample fast enough — meaning at more than twice the highest frequency in the original signal — and if the signal is band-limited, then all those sinc functions will line up perfectly, and we can fully recover the original signal.\\nThat’s the heart of the sampling theorem. It’s not just an abstract formula — it’s a practical method that allows us to move between continuous and digital signals with full confidence.\\n\\nThis slide beautifully summarizes the theory.
