What makes it so special?\\n\\nIn the last lecture, I mentioned something that gives us a clue.\\u000bIf you have a shift-invariant linear system, and you input a sinusoidal signal, what comes out is also a sinusoid, and — importantly — at the same frequency.\\nThat’s a big deal.\\nIt means the system doesn't generate any new frequencies. It doesn’t distort the sinusoid into some other shape. It simply scales it or shifts its phase — but the frequency stays the same.\\nThis is a unique and powerful property of sinusoids.\\n\\nNow let’s think about what that means for convolution and Fourier analysis.\\nIn time-domain analysis, convolution is the operation that describes how a system responds to an input.\\nBut if your input and your system are both described using sinusoids, and those sinusoids don’t change frequency, then it turns out convolution becomes multiplication in the Fourier domain.\\n\\nWhy?\\nBecause in the Fourier domain, every signal is broken into sinusoids. And if each one stays intact — same frequency in, same frequency out — then multiplying their responses is all you need to compute the system output.\\nThat’s exactly what the convolution theorem says:\\u000bConvolution in time equals multiplication in frequency.\\nBut — and this is important — this beautiful relationship only works because of the special behavior of sinusoids.\\nIf your input signal isn’t made of sinusoids, or your system doesn’t treat them nicely, this property breaks down.\\nThat’s why this theorem only exists for the Fourier transform, which is based entirely on sinusoids.\\u000bOther transforms — like wavelets or polynomials — don’t have this same \\\"in equals out\\\" behavior, and so they don’t give us a convolution theorem in the same way.\\n\\nIf you’re curious, I actually encourage you to think about this more. You could even write a short paper or a reflection on it.\\nHere’s something to try:\\nTry proving that if a function goes into a system and the same form comes out — unchanged except for amplitude and phase — then that function must be a sinusoid.\\n\\nAnd also prove the related idea:\\u000bIf sinusoids go in and come out with the same frequency, then convolution in time must match multiplication in frequency.\\nThese are two different ideas — but together, they give us the foundation for the convolution theorem and explain why Fourier analysis is so powerful for linear systems.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only.
