Its Fourier transform is a sinc function — which looks like a smooth wave with side ripples.\\nNow, if we take two gate functions and convolve them in time, we get a triangle function.\\n\\nSo what happens in the frequency domain?\\nEach gate becomes a sinc function. When we multiply the two sinc functions together, we get sinc squared.\\nThat is — sinc of s times sinc of s gives you sinc squared of s.\\n\\nSo the triangle function — which was a convolution of two gates — has a Fourier transform equal to sinc squared.\\nThat’s a beautiful result, and it all comes from the convolution theorem.\\nIt also shows how Fourier analysis turns complicated operations into simpler ones, especially in engineering, signal processing, and physics.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only.
