This shows different versions of a triangular function — blue, orange, and green. They all have the same shape, but different widths.\\nThe blue triangle is the narrowest.\\u000bThe orange one is a little wider.\\u000bAnd the green one is the widest of all.\\nNow, let’s look at what happens in the frequency domain — shown in the bottom plot.\\n\\nHere’s the key idea:\\u000bWhen the function gets wider in time, its frequency content gets narrower.\\nYou can see that clearly:\\nThe narrow blue triangle has the widest Fourier transform — that’s the blue curve in the bottom plot.\\nThe medium-width orange triangle gives a more focused frequency response — that’s the orange curve.\\nAnd the wide green triangle gives a sharp, tall peak in the frequency domain — the green curve below.\\nThis is the heart of the scaling property.\\u000bWider in time means tighter in frequency, and vice versa.\\n\\nIt’s a kind of duality — as if time and frequency are pulling on opposite ends of a rope.\\nAnd as a special case, if you use a delta function — which is infinitely narrow in time — its Fourier transform becomes perfectly flat, spread across all frequencies.\\nOn the other hand, a Gaussian function is balanced — it’s the only shape where both the time and frequency profiles remain Gaussian.\\nSo visually, scaling is not just a math trick — it’s a powerful way to understand how functions behave in both domains.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only.
