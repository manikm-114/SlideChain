The higher the value of n, the higher the frequency of that term.\\n\\nSo the general formula goes like this:\\nf of t equals a-zero over 2, plus the sum from n equals 1 to N of a-n times cosine of 2 pi n t, plus b-n times sine of 2 pi n t.\\nNow, where do these coefficients come from?\\nWell, we have formulas to compute them. That’s the trick!\\nTo find a zero, you integrate f of t from 0 to 1.\\nTo find a-n, you multiply f of t with cosine of 2 pi n t, and integrate.\\nAnd for b-n, you do the same, but with sine of 2 pi n t.\\n\\nSo if I give you any function f of t, you just plug it into these formulas, do the math, and you get a set of numbers — the a’s and b’s. With those coefficients, you can then reconstruct the original function by summing all the sine and cosine waves.\\nAs N gets larger — meaning you include more wave components — the reconstructed function becomes more and more accurate. In fact, when N approaches infinity, this series can represent the function exactly, under reasonable conditions.\\n\\nNow here’s something deeper: These sine and cosine functions form an orthonormal basis — that’s just a fancy way of saying they’re like the X, Y, and Z axes in 3D space, but in an infinite-dimensional space of functions.\\nSo geometrically, what you're doing is projecting the function f of t onto each basis function — kind of like breaking a 3D vector into its X, Y, and Z components. Except here, we’re breaking a function into sine, cosine, and constant components.\\n\\nIf this all feels a bit abstract, don’t worry. The key takeaway is:\\u000bWe’re representing a function as a sum of waves.\\u000bAnd we have formulas that let us find the right weights — or coefficients — for those waves.\\nThat’s what the Fourier series, in its real form, is all about.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only.
