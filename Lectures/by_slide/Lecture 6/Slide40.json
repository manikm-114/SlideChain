These two views are completely interchangeable, and Fourier analysis is the bridge between them.\\n\\nThat’s why this topic is so foundational. It’s not just about imaging. Fourier analysis underlies many areas — in physics, engineering, and even mathematics — wherever we want to understand structure in terms of frequency.\\nNow let’s take a moment to summarize what we’ve learned so far.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only.
