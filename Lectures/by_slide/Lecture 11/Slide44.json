For diseased patients, only those who fall far to the right of the threshold are called positive. That means many truly diseased patients on the left side are missed. The sensitivity — or true positive rate — drops to around 50%.\\nOn the other hand, for healthy patients, almost all are correctly classified. Only a very small slice on the right is misclassified as diseased. That means the false positive fraction is low, and specificity is high.\\n\\nSo in ROC space, where we plot sensitivity against 1 minus specificity, this operating point appears toward the lower-left corner.
