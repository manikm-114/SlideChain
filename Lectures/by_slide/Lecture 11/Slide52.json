They describe how these observers can be based on rigorous statistical decision theory, how they can be tailored to mimic human visual performance, and how they’re applied in practice — from system optimization to regulatory science.\\n\\nIn the next few slides, I’ll introduce you to some of the key types of model observers, starting from the ideal observer, and then moving toward more practical approximations like the Hotelling observer and modern approaches involving machine learning and neural networks.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only.
