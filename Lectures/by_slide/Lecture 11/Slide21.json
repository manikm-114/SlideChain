But if you are in a brightly lit room, the very same tiny light would be invisible. The background intensity is so high that the small change is masked.\\nYou’ve probably experienced this outdoors: at night, under a dark sky, you can see countless stars. But during the day, those same stars are still there — yet you can’t see them, because the bright background light overwhelms them.\\nThe same principle applies to hearing. In a quiet room, even a whisper can be heard.

If X is small, even a small delta makes a big difference. If X is large, the same delta hardly matters.\\nSo the contrast term in SSIM naturally captures this idea — it reflects the fact that our visual system is tuned to relative, not absolute, differences.
