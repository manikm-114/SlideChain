To do this properly, we want our measure to satisfy three basic conditions, or postulates.\\n\\nFirst, symmetry. The similarity between X and Y should be the same as the similarity between Y and X. In other words, order doesn’t matter. If you compare image A with image B, you should get the same result as comparing image B with image A.\\nSecond, boundedness.
