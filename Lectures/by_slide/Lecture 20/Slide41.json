Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nAnd this idea leads us to the next concept — what we call Omni-tomography.\\nOmni-tomography means all-in-one, all-at-once, and all-of-couplings. In other words, we want to bring all imaging modalities — CT, nuclear imaging, and MRI — together into a single integrated system.\\n\\nInstead of acquiring CT data first, then performing a nuclear scan, and finally running an MRI, the vision is to acquire all the information simultaneously, within one coordinated scan. Imagine a scanner capable of capturing structural, functional, and molecular information — all at the same time, perfectly aligned in space and synchronized in time.\\n\\nThis concept was proposed and discussed in a perspective paper titled “Towards Omni-Tomography — Grand Fusion of Multiple Modalities for Simultaneous Interior Tomography.” The paper outlines both the motivation and the technical strategies for making this vision possible.\\nThe idea is ambitious — it represents the ultimate form of imaging fusion — but it’s also the natural next step in medical imaging, combining everything we’ve learned from CT, MRI, and nuclear imaging into one unified platform.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only.
