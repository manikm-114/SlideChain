From the following slide text,\\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nHere we see an example of how a contrast agent like Gadolinium-DTPA, or Magnevist, works in clinical imaging. On the left is the chemical structure of Gd-DTPA. In this molecule, the gadolinium ion — which has seven unpaired electrons — is enclosed within a stable chelating cage. This cage prevents the toxic metal from freely interacting with biological tissue, while still allowing it to influence nearby water molecules. When water molecules come close to the contrast agent, they experience local magnetic field changes that speed up their T₁ relaxation, producing a brighter signal on the MRI image. Water molecules that directly interact with the free binding site of the gadolinium ion experience what we call inner-sphere relaxation, resulting in a strong signal increase. Those that are nearby but not directly bound experience outer-sphere relaxation, which is weaker but still noticeable.\\n\\nOn the right, you can see a brain MRI taken after administration of Gd-DTPA. Notice the bright region within the brain — this enhancement clearly reveals a tumor. The contrast agent has accumulated in that region because tumors typically have leaky vasculature, allowing the agent to diffuse more freely into the tissue. However, it’s important to mention that these contrast agents are not entirely safe. Although gadolinium is held within a chemical cage, studies have shown that residual traces of gadolinium can remain in the human body — particularly in the brain and kidneys — for a long time after injection. This has raised significant safety concerns.\\n\\nAs a result, the European Union has restricted or prohibited the clinical use of several popular gadolinium-based contrast agents. Researchers and manufacturers are now working to design safer alternatives — either agents that can be excreted more efficiently or new imaging methods that require little or no contrast agent at all. So while MRI contrast imaging is extremely powerful, it reminds us that even advanced, “non-ionizing” imaging technologies come with important safety considerations.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only.

On the left is the chemical structure of Gd-DTPA. In this molecule, the gadolinium ion — which has seven unpaired electrons — is enclosed within a stable chelating cage. This cage prevents the toxic metal from freely interacting with biological tissue, while still allowing it to influence nearby water molecules. When water molecules come close to the contrast agent, they experience local magnetic field changes that speed up their T₁ relaxation, producing a brighter signal on the MRI image. Water molecules that directly interact with the free binding site of the gadolinium ion experience what we call inner-sphere relaxation, resulting in a strong signal increase. Those that are nearby but not directly bound experience outer-sphere relaxation, which is weaker but still noticeable.\\n\\nOn the right, you can see a brain MRI taken after administration of Gd-DTPA.
