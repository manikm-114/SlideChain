Research in recent years has revealed that gadolinium-based agents — while extremely useful for improving image clarity — can sometimes remain in the body long after the scan, particularly in the brain and even within bone tissue. In response to this growing concern, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, launched an extensive investigation. In 2017, their committee reviewed evidence showing that traces of gadolinium could persist in brain tissues for many months after a single injection. MRI scans even showed increased signal intensity in regions where gadolinium had accumulated.\\n\\nFollowing this review, the EMA decided to take precautionary action. They suspended several widely used linear gadolinium-based contrast agents, including MultiHance, Omniscan, Magnevist, and OptiMARK. These were once very common in clinical MRI but are now restricted in Europe due to the risk of residual gadolinium retention. This is not something you’ll find discussed in most textbooks yet — it’s a relatively recent development, but an important one to know.
