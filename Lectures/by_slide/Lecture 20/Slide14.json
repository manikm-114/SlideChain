From the following slide text,\\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nNow, let’s look at what happens when we use a surface coil instead of a full birdcage coil that covers the entire patient. A surface coil is a smaller coil placed directly near the region of interest—for example, near the spinal cord or breast. Because it’s positioned so close to the tissue, it produces a very strong B-one field right next to the coil surface. However, the field strength drops off rapidly with distance, as you can see from the plot on the left. So the signal intensity is highest near the coil and becomes much weaker for tissues deeper inside the body.\\n\\nThis makes surface coils particularly useful for localized imaging, where we only need high-quality signals from a specific region, such as the spine or breast. They are also very important for parallel MRI, where multiple small coils are used together to collect data simultaneously from different parts of the body. This parallel setup helps speed up imaging and improve the overall signal-to-noise ratio.\\n\\nIn the past, implementing parallel MRI was quite challenging because it required careful calibration and coordination among many coils to cover the entire patient. But with modern electronics and coil arrays, this technique has become highly effective and widely used.\\nSo, with this slide, we’ve completed our overview of the MRI scanner hardware — the superconducting magnet for the B-zero field, the RF coils for generating and detecting the B-one field, and the gradient coils for spatial encoding along X, Y, and Z directions.\\n\\nUnderstanding how these fields — B-zero, B-one, and the gradient fields — work together is enough to grasp the essential physics behind MRI. Once you’re comfortable with these concepts, you’ll have a solid foundation for understanding the imaging process itself.\\n\\nIn the next section, we’ll shift our focus to pulse sequences — beginning with the spin echo sequence, which allows us to measure T-one-weighted, T-two-weighted, and proton-density images. Then, we’ll move on to gradient echo sequences for faster imaging, and later discuss MRI angiography, diffusion-weighted imaging, spectroscopy, and MRI contrast agents, along with their safety considerations.\\n\\nThis marks the transition from the hardware foundation of MRI to the signal manipulation and image formation techniques that make this technology so powerful.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only.

A surface coil is a smaller coil placed directly near the region of interest—for example, near the spinal cord or breast. Because it’s positioned so close to the tissue, it produces a very strong B-one field right next to the coil surface. However, the field strength drops off rapidly with distance, as you can see from the plot on the left. So the signal intensity is highest near the coil and becomes much weaker for tissues deeper inside the body.\\n\\nThis makes surface coils particularly useful for localized imaging, where we only need high-quality signals from a specific region, such as the spine or breast. They are also very important for parallel MRI, where multiple small coils are used together to collect data simultaneously from different parts of the body. This parallel setup helps speed up imaging and improve the overall signal-to-noise ratio.\\n\\nIn the past, implementing parallel MRI was quite challenging because it required careful calibration and coordination among many coils to cover the entire patient. But with modern electronics and coil arrays, this technique has become highly effective and widely used.\\nSo, with this slide, we’ve completed our overview of the MRI scanner hardware — the superconducting magnet for the B-zero field, the RF coils for generating and detecting the B-one field, and the gradient coils for spatial encoding along X, Y, and Z directions.\\n\\nUnderstanding how these fields — B-zero, B-one, and the gradient fields — work together is enough to grasp the essential physics behind MRI.
