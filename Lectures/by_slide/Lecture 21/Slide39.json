From the following slide text,\\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nAlright, so we’ve talked about lateral resolution — how well we can distinguish two points that are side by side. Now let’s move on to the next concept, which is axial resolution, or sometimes called longitudinal resolution — meaning how well we can distinguish two points along the direction of beam propagation.\\n\\nIf you look at this figure, it might seem a little tricky at first glance, but let’s walk through it carefully together. To understand axial resolution, remember that in ultrasound imaging we always send out short bursts, or pulses, of sound — not continuous waves. We need these pulses, and as we mentioned before when talking about damping, that damping helps shorten the pulse. A shorter pulse means better resolution.\\n\\nSo imagine you send out one pulse. You already know the speed of sound in the medium, so after a short while, the pulse travels outward, interacts with the tissue, and part of it comes back as an echo. Based on the time interval between when we send the pulse and when we receive the echo, we can calculate the round-trip distance the sound wave has traveled.\\n\\nNow, if I send another pulse right after the first one, the same process repeats — it goes out, reflects, and comes back. The key here is that axial resolution tells us how well we can resolve separate boundaries along that same line of travel. So the big question is: what’s the smallest distance between two reflecting surfaces that we can still tell apart? That minimum separable distance is what we call the axial resolution.\\n\\nIf those two boundaries are too close together, the echoes from them will overlap — just like what you see in this figure — and when that happens, all the signals merge, so you can’t tell which one is which. They just blur into one single reflection.\\nFrom this physical reasoning, we can define the formula for axial resolution. It’s given by one-half times the pulse duration times the speed of sound. Let me say that clearly — axial resolution equals one-half times pulse duration times c, where c represents the speed of sound in the medium.\\n\\nSo, mathematically, that’s:\\u000bAxial resolution equals one-half multiplied by pulse duration multiplied by c.\\nThis comes from a simple idea. For a first-order approximation, we assume the speed of sound is uniform throughout the tissue. Then we can look at which factors matter most. There are two major players here: the pulse duration and the sound speed. The smaller the pulse duration, the better the resolution. And actually, a smaller sound speed also improves resolution, because the wave doesn’t travel as far during each time interval.\\n\\nNow, picture this in your mind. You send out a pulse — it has a certain length, from the front, which we call the leading edge, to the back, which we call the trailing edge. This whole pulse moves through the tissue. As it moves, it hits boundaries — let’s call them surface A and surface B. The leading edge of the pulse reaches surface A first and reflects back, while the trailing part continues forward. Some portion of the pulse keeps going and hits surface B, and then that part reflects back too.\\n\\nSo the leading edge reflects first, and a moment later, the trailing edge and the transmitted component reach the second boundary. The reflected waves from surface A and surface B both travel back toward the transducer. Now, if these two boundaries are so close that the time difference between those reflections is shorter than the pulse duration, the two echoes overlap — and we cannot tell them apart. But if the separation is large enough that the round-trip time between them is longer than half the pulse duration, we can distinguish the two.\\n\\nThat’s exactly how we define axial resolution — it’s the distance between surface A and surface B that produces two distinguishable echoes. In symbols, we can write it as:\\u000bDelta x equals one-half times pulse duration times c.\\nLet me read that again in a smooth way:\\u000b“Delta x equals one-half times pulse duration times c.”\\nThe one-half factor is there because the sound wave travels a round trip — out to the boundary and then back — so only half of that total distance corresponds to the actual separation between two reflectors.\\n\\nSo here’s the physical picture:\\u000bIf the pulse duration is short, the leading and trailing edges of the pulse are close together, which means the echoes from A and B will be well separated in time — giving you better axial resolution.\\u000bIf the pulse duration is long, or if the boundaries are too close, then the echoes will merge together, and you’ll lose that resolution.\\nSo when we design ultrasound systems, we try to make the pulse as short as possible — and that’s where the damping material plays a critical role. The damping shortens the pulse, improves temporal separation, and gives us sharper axial resolution.\\n\\nTo sum it up:\\u000bAxial resolution represents the minimum distance between two boundaries along the beam path that can be resolved separately. It depends mainly on pulse duration and the speed of sound in the tissue. The shorter the pulse and the slower the sound, the finer the detail we can see along that direction.\\n\\nSo just review this figure carefully yourself. Once you visualize how the pulse moves forward, hits surface A, then surface B, and the echoes return, the logic becomes crystal clear. We now have both key ideas of spatial resolution — lateral resolution and axial resolution — and next, we’ll move on to discuss how all this affects image contrast, which determines how clearly structures appear on the ultrasound image.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only.

Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nAlright, so we’ve talked about lateral resolution — how well we can distinguish two points that are side by side. Now let’s move on to the next concept, which is axial resolution, or sometimes called longitudinal resolution — meaning how well we can distinguish two points along the direction of beam propagation.\\n\\nIf you look at this figure, it might seem a little tricky at first glance, but let’s walk through it carefully together. To understand axial resolution, remember that in ultrasound imaging we always send out short bursts, or pulses, of sound — not continuous waves. We need these pulses, and as we mentioned before when talking about damping, that damping helps shorten the pulse. A shorter pulse means better resolution.\\n\\nSo imagine you send out one pulse. You already know the speed of sound in the medium, so after a short while, the pulse travels outward, interacts with the tissue, and part of it comes back as an echo. Based on the time interval between when we send the pulse and when we receive the echo, we can calculate the round-trip distance the sound wave has traveled.\\n\\nNow, if I send another pulse right after the first one, the same process repeats — it goes out, reflects, and comes back. The key here is that axial resolution tells us how well we can resolve separate boundaries along that same line of travel. So the big question is: what’s the smallest distance between two reflecting surfaces that we can still tell apart? That minimum separable distance is what we call the axial resolution.\\n\\nIf those two boundaries are too close together, the echoes from them will overlap — just like what you see in this figure — and when that happens, all the signals merge, so you can’t tell which one is which. They just blur into one single reflection.\\nFrom this physical reasoning, we can define the formula for axial resolution. It’s given by one-half times the pulse duration times the speed of sound. Let me say that clearly — axial resolution equals one-half times pulse duration times c, where c represents the speed of sound in the medium.\\n\\nSo, mathematically, that’s:\\u000bAxial resolution equals one-half multiplied by pulse duration multiplied by c.\\nThis comes from a simple idea. For a first-order approximation, we assume the speed of sound is uniform throughout the tissue. Then we can look at which factors matter most. There are two major players here: the pulse duration and the sound speed. The smaller the pulse duration, the better the resolution. And actually, a smaller sound speed also improves resolution, because the wave doesn’t travel as far during each time interval.\\n\\nNow, picture this in your mind. You send out a pulse — it has a certain length, from the front, which we call the leading edge, to the back, which we call the trailing edge. This whole pulse moves through the tissue. As it moves, it hits boundaries — let’s call them surface A and surface B. The leading edge of the pulse reaches surface A first and reflects back, while the trailing part continues forward. Some portion of the pulse keeps going and hits surface B, and then that part reflects back too.\\n\\nSo the leading edge reflects first, and a moment later, the trailing edge and the transmitted component reach the second boundary. The reflected waves from surface A and surface B both travel back toward the transducer. Now, if these two boundaries are so close that the time difference between those reflections is shorter than the pulse duration, the two echoes overlap — and we cannot tell them apart. But if the separation is large enough that the round-trip time between them is longer than half the pulse duration, we can distinguish the two.\\n\\nThat’s exactly how we define axial resolution — it’s the distance between surface A and surface B that produces two distinguishable echoes. In symbols, we can write it as:\\u000bDelta x equals one-half times pulse duration times c.\\nLet me read that again in a smooth way:\\u000b“Delta x equals one-half times pulse duration times c.”\\nThe one-half factor is there because the sound wave travels a round trip — out to the boundary and then back — so only half of that total distance corresponds to the actual separation between two reflectors.\\n\\nSo here’s the physical picture:\\u000bIf the pulse duration is short, the leading and trailing edges of the pulse are close together, which means the echoes from A and B will be well separated in time — giving you better axial resolution.\\u000bIf the pulse duration is long, or if the boundaries are too close, then the echoes will merge together, and you’ll lose that resolution.\\nSo when we design ultrasound systems, we try to make the pulse as short as possible — and that’s where the damping material plays a critical role. The damping shortens the pulse, improves temporal separation, and gives us sharper axial resolution.\\n\\nTo sum it up:\\u000bAxial resolution represents the minimum distance between two boundaries along the beam path that can be resolved separately. It depends mainly on pulse duration and the speed of sound in the tissue. The shorter the pulse and the slower the sound, the finer the detail we can see along that direction.\\n\\nSo just review this figure carefully yourself.
