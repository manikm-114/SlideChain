Let’s break this down step by step.\\nThink about how ordinary sound travels through air. You can hear my voice because the sound waves — or pressure waves — travel from me to you through the air. Now imagine replacing the air with water molecules, or even biological tissue. The same principle applies.\\n\\nLet’s picture a small volume element, or what we might call a voxel, inside that material. Under normal conditions, that voxel is in equilibrium — it has a certain pressure, volume, and position. Nothing’s changing.\\n\\nBut now, suppose we push on one side of that element toward the right. This causes a displacement, denoted by the lowercase letter w. When we push it, the volume of that little element decreases because the particles are squeezed closer together.\\n\\nAccording to the conservation of mass, the total amount of material inside that voxel stays the same — but the pressure inside increases. That higher pressure creates a net force on neighboring elements, pushing them forward.\\n\\nBy Newton’s second law, the net force generates acceleration, which we call a. The acceleration then changes the velocity, denoted by u, and as the velocity builds up, the displacement w also changes further.\\n\\nSo, you can see that these quantities — displacement (w), velocity (u), acceleration (a), pressure (p), and volume (v) — are all linked together. They interact continuously as the disturbance moves through the medium.\\n\\nThis is not like pushing a rigid stick, where moving one end instantly moves the other. In a rigid body, everything moves together. But in an elastic medium, local motion depends on these dynamic relationships — one region moves, affects the next, and that disturbance travels as a wave.\\n\\nSo, an ultrasound wave forms because of this ongoing interplay between pressure, volume, and motion. Push a little, the volume shrinks, pressure rises, acceleration increases, and that disturbance keeps propagating through the material — and that’s your ultrasound wave.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only.

Under normal conditions, that voxel is in equilibrium — it has a certain pressure, volume, and position. Nothing’s changing.\\n\\nBut now, suppose we push on one side of that element toward the right. This causes a displacement, denoted by the lowercase letter w. When we push it, the volume of that little element decreases because the particles are squeezed closer together.\\n\\nAccording to the conservation of mass, the total amount of material inside that voxel stays the same — but the pressure inside increases. That higher pressure creates a net force on neighboring elements, pushing them forward.\\n\\nBy Newton’s second law, the net force generates acceleration, which we call a. The acceleration then changes the velocity, denoted by u, and as the velocity builds up, the displacement w also changes further.\\n\\nSo, you can see that these quantities — displacement (w), velocity (u), acceleration (a), pressure (p), and volume (v) — are all linked together. They interact continuously as the disturbance moves through the medium.\\n\\nThis is not like pushing a rigid stick, where moving one end instantly moves the other. In a rigid body, everything moves together. But in an elastic medium, local motion depends on these dynamic relationships — one region moves, affects the next, and that disturbance travels as a wave.\\n\\nSo, an ultrasound wave forms because of this ongoing interplay between pressure, volume, and motion. Push a little, the volume shrinks, pressure rises, acceleration increases, and that disturbance keeps propagating through the material — and that’s your ultrasound wave.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only.
