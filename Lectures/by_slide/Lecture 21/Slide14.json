From the following slide text,\\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nHere again, we see how a longitudinal wave behaves in ultrasound. The sound originates from a source, like a vibrating tuning fork. In fact, in the old days, doctors would use a tuning fork to test hearing — by striking it and moving it near the ear, they could tell if the patient could sense sound through air or through bone conduction. That tuning fork generates a longitudinal sound wave, where the compressions and rarefactions travel along the direction of vibration.\\n\\nNow, both longitudinal and transverse waves have some key characteristics. They each have a wavelength, which is the distance between two corresponding points — like from one peak to the next, or from one compression to the next. That’s the spatial period of the wave. They also have amplitude, which represents how strong the wave is — the height of a peak or the depth of a trough.\\n\\nIf you look at the shape of these waves, you’ll notice they form a sinusoidal pattern — this is not a coincidence. Sinusoidal waves naturally arise when solving the wave equation, whether it’s for mechanical or electromagnetic waves. Mathematically, they are fundamental solutions. And in Fourier analysis, we use sinusoidal components — sines and cosines — as building blocks to represent all kinds of signals. So in a way, every complex sound or image signal can be broken down into a sum of simple sine waves.\\n\\nFinally, remember that the speed of sound is directly connected to the wave equation.

The sound originates from a source, like a vibrating tuning fork. In fact, in the old days, doctors would use a tuning fork to test hearing — by striking it and moving it near the ear, they could tell if the patient could sense sound through air or through bone conduction. That tuning fork generates a longitudinal sound wave, where the compressions and rarefactions travel along the direction of vibration.\\n\\nNow, both longitudinal and transverse waves have some key characteristics. They each have a wavelength, which is the distance between two corresponding points — like from one peak to the next, or from one compression to the next. That’s the spatial period of the wave.
