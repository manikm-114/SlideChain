From the following slide text,\\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nNow let’s move on to ultrasound focusing, which is another crucial concept for improving lateral resolution. You can think of this just like focusing light through a lens in photography. The figure here from your textbook shows three cases: strong focusing, weak focusing, and a reference to how the focal plane and focal distance change.\\n\\nIf we have a single-crystal transducer — often shaped like a disk — it can have a concave surface, meaning it curves inward. The curvature acts like an optical lens, helping to converge the ultrasound beam to a smaller focal spot. When the curvature is stronger, the beam converges faster, giving us a shorter focal distance and a tighter focus. That means, at that focal point, you have very high resolution — the beam is extremely narrow, and you can separate fine structures clearly. However, beyond that focal plane, the beam quickly diverges again, and the resolution deteriorates.\\n\\nIf the transducer surface is only slightly curved, the focusing is weaker. The focal distance becomes longer, and the beam stays more uniform downstream. The resolution isn’t as sharp at the focal point, but it’s more consistent along the depth of field. So there’s always a trade-off — strong focusing gives you very high resolution over a small region, while weak focusing gives you moderate resolution over a wider range.\\n\\nNow, in both optics and acoustics, we use a quantity called the F-number, or F-ratio, to describe focusing strength. The F-number is defined as the radius of curvature divided by twice the aperture radius. Mathematically, that’s:\\nF equals R divided by two A.\\n\\nHere, R is the radius of curvature, and A is the aperture radius. So, a smaller R or a larger aperture A gives you a smaller F-number — meaning stronger focusing. Conversely, a large F-number corresponds to weaker focusing.\\n\\nSo what we’re really describing here is how lateral resolution changes as a function of focusing strength and imaging depth. When you design an ultrasound system, you must decide whether you want a narrow beam with strong focusing or a broader, more uniform beam with weaker focusing, depending on your imaging application.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only.

From the following slide text,\\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nNow let’s move on to ultrasound focusing, which is another crucial concept for improving lateral resolution. You can think of this just like focusing light through a lens in photography. The figure here from your textbook shows three cases: strong focusing, weak focusing, and a reference to how the focal plane and focal distance change.\\n\\nIf we have a single-crystal transducer — often shaped like a disk — it can have a concave surface, meaning it curves inward. The curvature acts like an optical lens, helping to converge the ultrasound beam to a smaller focal spot. When the curvature is stronger, the beam converges faster, giving us a shorter focal distance and a tighter focus. That means, at that focal point, you have very high resolution — the beam is extremely narrow, and you can separate fine structures clearly. However, beyond that focal plane, the beam quickly diverges again, and the resolution deteriorates.\\n\\nIf the transducer surface is only slightly curved, the focusing is weaker. The focal distance becomes longer, and the beam stays more uniform downstream. The resolution isn’t as sharp at the focal point, but it’s more consistent along the depth of field. So there’s always a trade-off — strong focusing gives you very high resolution over a small region, while weak focusing gives you moderate resolution over a wider range.\\n\\nNow, in both optics and acoustics, we use a quantity called the F-number, or F-ratio, to describe focusing strength. The F-number is defined as the radius of curvature divided by twice the aperture radius. Mathematically, that’s:\\nF equals R divided by two A.\\n\\nHere, R is the radius of curvature, and A is the aperture radius. So, a smaller R or a larger aperture A gives you a smaller F-number — meaning stronger focusing. Conversely, a large F-number corresponds to weaker focusing.\\n\\nSo what we’re really describing here is how lateral resolution changes as a function of focusing strength and imaging depth. When you design an ultrasound system, you must decide whether you want a narrow beam with strong focusing or a broader, more uniform beam with weaker focusing, depending on your imaging application.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only.
