Equation 3.8 and the table shown here give you typical values.\\n\\nIf you look at the numbers, you can get a feeling for how impedance and sound speed vary across materials. In air, the sound speed is only about 330 meters per second, because air is very light and compressible. In biological tissues like the kidney or liver, the sound speed is much higher — around 1,560 to 1,570 meters per second — because these materials are denser and less compressible.\\n\\nNow, if you ask where sound travels the fastest inside the human body, the answer is bone, because bone is the densest and stiffest material we have. The table shows a speed of about 3,500 meters per second in bone, which is several times faster than in soft tissue.\\nThese are just typical examples of tissue acoustic properties, but they are extremely important for understanding how ultrasound interacts with different parts of the body.

Equation 3.8 and the table shown here give you typical values.\\n\\nIf you look at the numbers, you can get a feeling for how impedance and sound speed vary across materials. In air, the sound speed is only about 330 meters per second, because air is very light and compressible. In biological tissues like the kidney or liver, the sound speed is much higher — around 1,560 to 1,570 meters per second — because these materials are denser and less compressible.\\n\\nNow, if you ask where sound travels the fastest inside the human body, the answer is bone, because bone is the densest and stiffest material we have. The table shows a speed of about 3,500 meters per second in bone, which is several times faster than in soft tissue.\\nThese are just typical examples of tissue acoustic properties, but they are extremely important for understanding how ultrasound interacts with different parts of the body.
