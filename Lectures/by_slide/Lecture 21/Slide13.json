Remember what we discussed earlier — when you push a volume of air in one direction and then release it, the molecules move back and forth along that same line. This back-and-forth motion produces a longitudinal wave, where regions of compression and rarefaction travel in the same direction as the wave. That’s what we call a P-wave, or pressure wave.

Instead of moving along the same line, the oscillation happens perpendicular to the wave’s direction. So if the wave moves horizontally, the vibration is up and down.

Remember what we discussed earlier — when you push a volume of air in one direction and then release it, the molecules move back and forth along that same line. This back-and-forth motion produces a longitudinal wave, where regions of compression and rarefaction travel in the same direction as the wave. That’s what we call a P-wave, or pressure wave. In ultrasound, this is the type of wave we use — the longitudinal wave traveling through soft tissue.\\n\\nNow, if we compare that to a transverse wave, the vibration direction is completely different. Instead of moving along the same line, the oscillation happens perpendicular to the wave’s direction. So if the wave moves horizontally, the vibration is up and down. This is exactly what happens with electromagnetic waves, like light or radio waves — their electric and magnetic fields vibrate at right angles to the direction the wave is moving.\\n\\nSo, to summarize: in a longitudinal wave, the vibration and propagation directions are the same, while in a transverse wave, they are orthogonal. Both are just different ways energy can propagate through a medium.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only.
