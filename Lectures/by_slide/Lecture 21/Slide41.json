From the following slide text,\\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nLet’s look more closely at these microbubbles and how they work as ultrasound contrast agents.\\nMicrobubbles are very small — typically two to five micrometers in diameter — and are encapsulated by a shell made of either albumin or a lipid layer. This shell makes them stable enough to circulate through the bloodstream without immediately collapsing. Their stability can be further enhanced by filling them with a high molecular weight gas, which diffuses out more slowly than regular air.\\n\\nThese microbubbles are produced outside the human body and then introduced into the bloodstream through an intravenous injection. Once inside the bloodstream, they interact with ultrasound waves. When the ultrasound beam hits them, the microbubbles start to oscillate — they expand and contract in sync with the pressure variations of the sound wave.\\n\\nBecause the interface between the gas inside the bubble and the surrounding liquid is not acoustically transparent, a strong reflection occurs. This makes microbubbles act as powerful scatterers, producing bright, well-defined echoes. As a result, microvasculature and even small blood vessels become visible on ultrasound images, greatly improving the detection of blood flow and perfusion.\\n\\nMoreover, these microbubbles can be customized. Scientists can modify the shell using polymers or special coatings that allow the surface to be functionalized with antibodies. When certain antibodies are attached, the microbubbles can specifically bind to biological targets — for example, tumor cells or inflammatory markers.\\nWhen that happens, the microbubbles accumulate around those target regions. On the ultrasound image, those regions appear as bright, localized signals — making it possible to identify molecular features, not just structural ones. In other words, microbubbles transform ultrasound from a purely anatomical imaging modality into a molecular and cellular imaging tool.\\n\\nSo, when you see very bright, clustered signals after microbubble injection, it often indicates the presence of something biologically distinct — such as a tumor. This development marks a major advancement in medical ultrasound, extending it from traditional imaging into targeted diagnostics.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only.

Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nLet’s look more closely at these microbubbles and how they work as ultrasound contrast agents.\\nMicrobubbles are very small — typically two to five micrometers in diameter — and are encapsulated by a shell made of either albumin or a lipid layer. This shell makes them stable enough to circulate through the bloodstream without immediately collapsing. Their stability can be further enhanced by filling them with a high molecular weight gas, which diffuses out more slowly than regular air.\\n\\nThese microbubbles are produced outside the human body and then introduced into the bloodstream through an intravenous injection. Once inside the bloodstream, they interact with ultrasound waves. When the ultrasound beam hits them, the microbubbles start to oscillate — they expand and contract in sync with the pressure variations of the sound wave.\\n\\nBecause the interface between the gas inside the bubble and the surrounding liquid is not acoustically transparent, a strong reflection occurs. This makes microbubbles act as powerful scatterers, producing bright, well-defined echoes. As a result, microvasculature and even small blood vessels become visible on ultrasound images, greatly improving the detection of blood flow and perfusion.\\n\\nMoreover, these microbubbles can be customized. Scientists can modify the shell using polymers or special coatings that allow the surface to be functionalized with antibodies. When certain antibodies are attached, the microbubbles can specifically bind to biological targets — for example, tumor cells or inflammatory markers.\\nWhen that happens, the microbubbles accumulate around those target regions. On the ultrasound image, those regions appear as bright, localized signals — making it possible to identify molecular features, not just structural ones. In other words, microbubbles transform ultrasound from a purely anatomical imaging modality into a molecular and cellular imaging tool.\\n\\nSo, when you see very bright, clustered signals after microbubble injection, it often indicates the presence of something biologically distinct — such as a tumor. This development marks a major advancement in medical ultrasound, extending it from traditional imaging into targeted diagnostics.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only.
