These slides and my book draft will be your main reference, and they provide a clear, step-by-step path for following the key steps and get the main idea.\\n\\nThe content you see here is part of a larger foundation in medical imaging. Once you have a solid grasp of these concepts, it will be much easier to understand advanced topics like X-ray tomography, nuclear imaging, and MRI.\\n\\nFourier analysis is central to all of these areas.
