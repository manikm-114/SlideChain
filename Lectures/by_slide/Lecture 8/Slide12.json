Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nNow let’s see why aliasing makes recovery non-unique.\\n\\nIn this diagram, the red and blue curves represent two different sets of frequency components. When aliasing happens, these components overlap in the frequency domain. At the points where they overlap, what we measure is just the sum of their values.\\nFor example, imagine that at a certain frequency, the blue component has a value of A, and the red component also has some value. When they overlap, all we see is their sum. That means many different combinations of blue and red could produce the exact same total.\\n\\nIn other words, you can’t tell exactly how much came from the blue curve and how much came from the red one. The information about their contributions is lost.\\nThis is why aliasing is such a problem — once two spectra overlap, there is no unique way to separate them. No matter how you process the data, you can’t reconstruct the original spectrum with certainty.\\n\\nThat’s why the Nyquist theorem’s condition — sampling faster than twice the highest frequency — is so important.
