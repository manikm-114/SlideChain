Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nHere we have an example showing the effects of different image filters, both in the spatial domain and in the frequency domain.\\n\\nIn the top left is our original image — a close-up of an eye. Next to it, in the top right, we see its two-dimensional Fourier transform, which shows the frequency content of the image.\\n\\nOn the second row, we have three filtered versions of the image in the spatial domain:\\nUnsharp Image — produced by applying an unsharp filter, which enhances edges and fine details by subtracting a blurred version of the image from the original.\\nGaussian Blurred Image — generated using a Gaussian filter, which smooths the image by reducing high-frequency details, resulting in a softer appearance.\\nSobel Filtered Image — created using the Sobel operator, which emphasizes edges, particularly strong intensity changes. In the eye image, you can clearly see the contours of the iris, eyelid, and surrounding features.\\nThe third row shows the corresponding frequency-domain representations for each filter.\\n\\nFor the Gaussian blur, you can see that high-frequency components are greatly reduced, as indicated by the darker edges in the spectrum.\\nFor the unsharp filter, higher frequencies are more pronounced, showing stronger edge components.\\nFor the Sobel filter, the spectrum highlights frequencies associated with sharp transitions in the image, which is why it’s effective for edge detection.\\n\\nBy choosing different filters, we can highlight or suppress specific image features — whether we want to sharpen details, blur textures, or extract edges for further analysis.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only.
