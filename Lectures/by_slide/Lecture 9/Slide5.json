One is fixed, and the other is flipped and shifted.\\nIn convolution, we take one function — or one signal — and flip it around, just like turning a right hand into a left hand. Then, we slide it along the other signal. At each position, we calculate how much the two shapes overlap. The amount of overlap becomes the value of the convolution at that point.\\n\\nThe picture here shows this idea using two hands.
