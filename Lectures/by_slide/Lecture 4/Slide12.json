From the following slide text,\\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nLet’s take a deeper look at the Dirac delta function — one of the most powerful concepts in system analysis.\\nThe delta function is what we call a generalized function, or in mathematical terms, a distribution. It helps us model a perfect impulse — something that delivers a concentrated effect at a single moment in time.\\n\\nNow, here’s how we describe it mathematically:\\nWe say that delta of t minus t naught equals zero for all values of t not equal to t naught.\\u000bAnd, when we integrate this delta function from minus infinity to infinity, the result is one.\\nWhat does that mean?\\nIt means the function is zero everywhere — except at one specific point in time, which we call t naught. At that single point, it has an infinitely sharp spike, but the area under the spike is exactly one. That area is what we call the impulse.\\nSo even though we can’t see or draw the spike perfectly, we know that its total effect — the impulse — is one. That’s what matters. The effect is important, but the exact shape doesn’t matter.\\n\\nNow, let’s shift to the discrete version of the delta function — something we use in digital systems.\\nWe define delta of n like this:\\nIt equals one when n is zero,\\u000band it equals zero for all other values of n.\\n\\nIn other words, this function is zero everywhere — except at n equals zero, where it has a value of one.\\u000bIt’s a single pulse — like a quick tap — at a specific point in time.\\n\\nWe can also shift this pulse. For example, delta of n minus two just moves the pulse to position n equals two.\\n\\nThis simple pulse is incredibly useful. It forms the building block for discrete-time convolution, which we’ll talk about next.\\nSo both the continuous and discrete versions of the delta function help us analyze how systems respond to input — whether we’re dealing with real-world signals or digital data.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only.

From the following slide text,\\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nLet’s take a deeper look at the Dirac delta function — one of the most powerful concepts in system analysis.\\nThe delta function is what we call a generalized function, or in mathematical terms, a distribution. It helps us model a perfect impulse — something that delivers a concentrated effect at a single moment in time.\\n\\nNow, here’s how we describe it mathematically:\\nWe say that delta of t minus t naught equals zero for all values of t not equal to t naught.\\u000bAnd, when we integrate this delta function from minus infinity to infinity, the result is one.\\nWhat does that mean?\\nIt means the function is zero everywhere — except at one specific point in time, which we call t naught. At that single point, it has an infinitely sharp spike, but the area under the spike is exactly one. That area is what we call the impulse.\\nSo even though we can’t see or draw the spike perfectly, we know that its total effect — the impulse — is one. That’s what matters. The effect is important, but the exact shape doesn’t matter.\\n\\nNow, let’s shift to the discrete version of the delta function — something we use in digital systems.\\nWe define delta of n like this:\\nIt equals one when n is zero,\\u000band it equals zero for all other values of n.\\n\\nIn other words, this function is zero everywhere — except at n equals zero, where it has a value of one.\\u000bIt’s a single pulse — like a quick tap — at a specific point in time.\\n\\nWe can also shift this pulse. For example, delta of n minus two just moves the pulse to position n equals two.\\n\\nThis simple pulse is incredibly useful. It forms the building block for discrete-time convolution, which we’ll talk about next.\\nSo both the continuous and discrete versions of the delta function help us analyze how systems respond to input — whether we’re dealing with real-world signals or digital data.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only.
