The reason lies in precision. By applying the limiting process, we create a perfect, universal model of an impulse, one that’s as rigorous as the definition of a derivative in calculus.\\nThink of how we define a derivative: we take a small change, and by letting that change approach zero, we achieve an exact result. We’re doing something similar here with the Dirac delta function.\\n\\nNow, regarding the shape of the delta function — does it matter? In fact, no. What matters is the area under the curve, not how the curve looks. It’s like receiving payment: whether it comes in one sum or in smaller installments, the total value is what counts.\\n\\nInterestingly, if you start worrying about the exact shape without measuring it, you’re in uncertain territory. Without measurement, all shapes are possible — a bit like the probabilistic world of quantum mechanics! Only when we observe or measure do we know what’s truly there.

The reason lies in precision. By applying the limiting process, we create a perfect, universal model of an impulse, one that’s as rigorous as the definition of a derivative in calculus.\\nThink of how we define a derivative: we take a small change, and by letting that change approach zero, we achieve an exact result. We’re doing something similar here with the Dirac delta function.\\n\\nNow, regarding the shape of the delta function — does it matter? In fact, no. What matters is the area under the curve, not how the curve looks. It’s like receiving payment: whether it comes in one sum or in smaller installments, the total value is what counts.\\n\\nInterestingly, if you start worrying about the exact shape without measuring it, you’re in uncertain territory.
