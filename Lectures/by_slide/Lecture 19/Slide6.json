That gives:\\u000by equals A e to the k t, where A is a constant.\\n\\nThis shows that whenever the process is described by a first-order differential equation, the solution must be of this form: y is exponential growth or exponential decay. In other words, a constant multiplied by an exponential function, with index k t, where t is time.\\n\\nSo, this explains why you see exponential decay, exponential growth, or attenuation in earlier imaging modalities like X-ray imaging, and why you see the same behavior here in MRI.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only.
