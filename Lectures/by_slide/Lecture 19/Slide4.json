From the following slide text,\\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nSo, T1 and T2 relaxation, this is kind of a review. T1 and T2 are quite different.\\n\\nT1: We talk about the recovery of the M vector along the z-axis — that’s the main field direction. T1 time is defined as sixty-three percent recovery of our original M vector, which we call M-naught. This is about spin–lattice interaction, something that involves energy.\\nWhen you turn the M vector into a certain direction, like a ninety-degree direction, the energy you used — injected into the tissue — will eventually be lost due to spin–lattice interaction. And it will gradually return to the steady state. The M vector wants to be aligned along the main field direction, which is the B-naught field, or the z direction.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the T2 parameter talks about the dephasing effect. The M vector is not just an individual thing — it’s really a collective phenomenon. All of the small magnets, the spinning protons, are very small magnets. Altogether, they form the big M vector.\\nIf you flip the M vector, say by ninety degrees, from the z direction into the y or x direction, this big M vector at first points all in one direction. But it is made of many small magnets, and some of those spins are faster, some are slower, because of inhomogeneity in the B-naught field or in the local field. The local field — ions, molecules, molecular motion — all these things contribute to that inhomogeneity.\\n\\nOriginally, all the small magnets line up along the x-axis. If you apply a ninety-degree pulse with respect to the y-axis, you flip the M vector along the x-axis. But with time, this will dephase. Some processes are a little faster, some slower. And after a long enough time, all these small magnets, or spinning protons, are pointing in different directions.\\n\\nThe overall field is no longer this original M-naught. Instead, it becomes effectively zero. The decay is modeled as an exponential curve — something like what you see on the slide. So, this is recovery, and this is decay. That is the T1, T2 story.\\nLet me give you a little more mathematical detail so you understand why both the recovery and the dephasing follow an exponential curve. One is growing, the other is decaying. It’s something like this.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only.

Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nSo, T1 and T2 relaxation, this is kind of a review. T1 and T2 are quite different.\\n\\nT1: We talk about the recovery of the M vector along the z-axis — that’s the main field direction. T1 time is defined as sixty-three percent recovery of our original M vector, which we call M-naught. This is about spin–lattice interaction, something that involves energy.\\nWhen you turn the M vector into a certain direction, like a ninety-degree direction, the energy you used — injected into the tissue — will eventually be lost due to spin–lattice interaction. And it will gradually return to the steady state. The M vector wants to be aligned along the main field direction, which is the B-naught field, or the z direction.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the T2 parameter talks about the dephasing effect. The M vector is not just an individual thing — it’s really a collective phenomenon. All of the small magnets, the spinning protons, are very small magnets. Altogether, they form the big M vector.\\nIf you flip the M vector, say by ninety degrees, from the z direction into the y or x direction, this big M vector at first points all in one direction. But it is made of many small magnets, and some of those spins are faster, some are slower, because of inhomogeneity in the B-naught field or in the local field. The local field — ions, molecules, molecular motion — all these things contribute to that inhomogeneity.\\n\\nOriginally, all the small magnets line up along the x-axis. If you apply a ninety-degree pulse with respect to the y-axis, you flip the M vector along the x-axis. But with time, this will dephase. Some processes are a little faster, some slower. And after a long enough time, all these small magnets, or spinning protons, are pointing in different directions.\\n\\nThe overall field is no longer this original M-naught. Instead, it becomes effectively zero. The decay is modeled as an exponential curve — something like what you see on the slide. So, this is recovery, and this is decay. That is the T1, T2 story.\\nLet me give you a little more mathematical detail so you understand why both the recovery and the dephasing follow an exponential curve. One is growing, the other is decaying. It’s something like this.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only.
