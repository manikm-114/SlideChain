From the following slide text,\\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nSo now let’s talk about how the data are actually collected in the k-space. When time t equals zero, the k value is also zero, which means you are sitting right at the center of k-space. As time increases during the frequency encoding readout, the trajectory moves gradually toward the right-hand side along the k x direction. In this way, you begin to cover half of the Fourier domain. Now remember, for real-valued functions, the Fourier transform has a very useful symmetry property: if you only collect data from one half of k-space, the other half can be inferred mathematically. This symmetry reduces the amount of data we need, but in practice, MRI systems still often collect both halves to account for noise and to achieve cleaner reconstructions.\\n\\nThis diagram shows how the data lines are filled. Each horizontal line corresponds to a readout under the frequency-encoding gradient, which traces across k x. After finishing one line, you step the phase-encoding gradient to a new value, moving up or down in the k y direction, and then record another frequency-encoded line. So, for example, line one at the bottom corresponds to the maximum negative value of the phase-encoding gradient. Then you step gradually upward, line by line, until you reach the maximum positive value of k y. The spacing between these lines is delta k y, and the spacing along the frequency-encoding direction is delta k x. By repeating this process, you fill up the entire k-space grid point by point, line by line.\\n\\nThis is why we call it k-space: each coordinate, k x and k y, corresponds to a Fourier component of the image. Once the k-space is fully sampled, an inverse Fourier transform is applied, and that directly reconstructs the image in the spatial domain. So the essential idea is very simple but very powerful: MRI does not record the image directly. Instead, it records data in k-space, which is really the Fourier space, and then uses the inverse transform to bring everything back into an image we can see.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only.

Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nSo now let’s talk about how the data are actually collected in the k-space. When time t equals zero, the k value is also zero, which means you are sitting right at the center of k-space. As time increases during the frequency encoding readout, the trajectory moves gradually toward the right-hand side along the k x direction. In this way, you begin to cover half of the Fourier domain. Now remember, for real-valued functions, the Fourier transform has a very useful symmetry property: if you only collect data from one half of k-space, the other half can be inferred mathematically. This symmetry reduces the amount of data we need, but in practice, MRI systems still often collect both halves to account for noise and to achieve cleaner reconstructions.\\n\\nThis diagram shows how the data lines are filled. Each horizontal line corresponds to a readout under the frequency-encoding gradient, which traces across k x. After finishing one line, you step the phase-encoding gradient to a new value, moving up or down in the k y direction, and then record another frequency-encoded line. So, for example, line one at the bottom corresponds to the maximum negative value of the phase-encoding gradient. Then you step gradually upward, line by line, until you reach the maximum positive value of k y. The spacing between these lines is delta k y, and the spacing along the frequency-encoding direction is delta k x. By repeating this process, you fill up the entire k-space grid point by point, line by line.\\n\\nThis is why we call it k-space: each coordinate, k x and k y, corresponds to a Fourier component of the image. Once the k-space is fully sampled, an inverse Fourier transform is applied, and that directly reconstructs the image in the spatial domain. So the essential idea is very simple but very powerful: MRI does not record the image directly. Instead, it records data in k-space, which is really the Fourier space, and then uses the inverse transform to bring everything back into an image we can see.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only.
