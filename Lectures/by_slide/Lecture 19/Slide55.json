You can see that it has three problems, numbered 4.7 through 4.9. In problem 4.7, you are asked to look at the five frequencies shown in the figure above and then state the order of the T1 and T2 relaxation times. For example, you might write something like T1 of brain is greater than T1 of CSF, which is greater than T1 of aqueous humor. The goal here is to compare how different tissues relax under different frequencies.\\n\\nIn problem 4.8, you are working with hydrogen nuclei in fat and water. You are told that the T2 value of fat is 100 milliseconds and the T2 value of water is 500 milliseconds. In a spin echo experiment, you need to calculate the delay time between the ninety-degree pulse and the one-eighty-degree pulse that maximizes the difference in signal between fat and water. This problem makes you think about how relaxation differences translate into image contrast.\\n\\nFinally, in problem 4.9, you are asked to write an expression for the longitudinal magnetization, M z, as a function of time after a one-eighty-degree pulse. You should then determine the time at which M z becomes zero. After that, you need to plot what happens if, instead of a one-eighty-degree pulse, you apply a one-thirty-five-degree pulse.

Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nThis slide gives you the homework assignment for this section. You can see that it has three problems, numbered 4.7 through 4.9. In problem 4.7, you are asked to look at the five frequencies shown in the figure above and then state the order of the T1 and T2 relaxation times. For example, you might write something like T1 of brain is greater than T1 of CSF, which is greater than T1 of aqueous humor. The goal here is to compare how different tissues relax under different frequencies.\\n\\nIn problem 4.8, you are working with hydrogen nuclei in fat and water. You are told that the T2 value of fat is 100 milliseconds and the T2 value of water is 500 milliseconds. In a spin echo experiment, you need to calculate the delay time between the ninety-degree pulse and the one-eighty-degree pulse that maximizes the difference in signal between fat and water. This problem makes you think about how relaxation differences translate into image contrast.\\n\\nFinally, in problem 4.9, you are asked to write an expression for the longitudinal magnetization, M z, as a function of time after a one-eighty-degree pulse. You should then determine the time at which M z becomes zero. After that, you need to plot what happens if, instead of a one-eighty-degree pulse, you apply a one-thirty-five-degree pulse. This problem connects the mathematical model to how pulse angle changes affect the signal.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only.
