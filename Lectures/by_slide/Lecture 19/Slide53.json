From the following slide text,\\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nThis slide shows a potential MRI-guided radiation therapy design proposed by Xun Jia and colleagues. What you see here is a concept where the MRI magnet is split into two halves, with a separation of about 70 centimeters. That gap allows room for radiation beams to pass through while still maintaining the magnetic field needed for MRI imaging. The design also includes a couch that can rotate by plus or minus twenty-five degrees, giving flexibility in patient positioning and beam delivery angles.\\n\\nThe circular ring you see provides both mechanical stability and magnet shielding. This is very important because strong magnetic fields need to be contained and stabilized to prevent interference with surrounding equipment and to protect patient safety. In addition to the MRI magnet, the design also considers adding a cone-beam CT, or CBCT, mounted on the same ring. Although not shown in this illustration, the CBCT would provide complementary X-ray imaging, making this a hybrid system that combines MRI’s excellent soft tissue contrast with CT’s accuracy for dose calculation.\\n\\nClearly, this figure illustrates an innovative idea in radiation oncology — a split-magnet MRI system, integrated into a rotating gantry, designed to guide precise radiation treatment while maintaining real-time MRI imaging of the tumor.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only.
