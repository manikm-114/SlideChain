From the following slide text,\\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nLet’s explain the reciprocal relationship. We start with a constant, K. This K describes the strength of dephasing. If dephasing is due to spin–spin interaction, we can call it K1. If dephasing is due to external magnetic field inhomogeneity, we can call it K2. So, the total rate of dephasing is due to both K1 plus K2. Then, the time constant is simply the reciprocal of that total: one over K1 plus K2. That’s where the reciprocal relationship comes in.\\n\\nIf you still feel unclear, let’s connect it to something we already studied: nuclear imaging. When we studied nuclear decay, we said that a radioactive tracer inside the body disappears through two processes. One is physical radioactive decay, which happens naturally over time. The other is biological clearance, where the tracer leaves the body through circulation, mainly through urination. So, there are two mechanisms removing the tracer — one biological and the other physical — and together, they follow the same reciprocal rule.\\n\\nIn that case, we use the decay constant, lambda. The overall decay rate is lambda-one plus lambda-two, and the corresponding half-life is the reciprocal of lambda. So, just like in nuclear decay, where both physical and biological processes add together, in MRI, both spin–spin interaction and external inhomogeneity add together. Don’t be confused if you see these different equations — equation two-point-four for nuclear medicine and equation four-point-two-nine for MRI — because mathematically, they are describing the same idea.\\n\\nTo summarize: when we talk about T2, we really mean three different things. One is the biological T2, or pure spin–spin relaxation. The second is T2 plus, from external field inhomogeneity. And the third is T2 star, the combined effect of both. Now we have T1 and T2.

One is the biological T2, or pure spin–spin relaxation. The second is T2 plus, from external field inhomogeneity. And the third is T2 star, the combined effect of both. Now we have T1 and T2. The question is: how do we measure them?\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only.
