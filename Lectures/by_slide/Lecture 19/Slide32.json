From the following slide text,\\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nAnd here you see another important point: full coverage in k-space. If we look at this figure, you can see how we can slightly modify the pulse sequence to make sure the entire k-space is covered symmetrically. Normally, during frequency encoding, you simply start your data collection right away. That means your measurement begins at time t equal to zero, so the k x trajectory also starts at zero and moves only into the positive side. This means, by default, you are not covering the negative part of k-space.\\n\\nSo how do we fix this? Before the regular frequency encoding and data acquisition, we apply what is called a dephasing gradient. This is shown here as G dephase. By applying this dephasing pulse, we effectively shift the starting point of the k x trajectory into the negative region. In other words, instead of starting at zero, all the frequency components now begin with a negative k x value. Then, as time increases during the readout, the trajectory sweeps across k-space and eventually moves into the positive side. By doing this, you cover the entire rectangular region of k-space, centered around the origin.\\nThis is important because, according to the Nyquist sampling theorem, you need to cover the full bandwidth of frequencies to accurately reconstruct the image. If your sampling region is too narrow, you will miss some Fourier components, and that leads to aliasing or artifacts in the reconstructed image. By carefully choosing the dephasing and rephasing gradients, you make sure that this rectangular region in k-space is wide enough to include all of the significant Fourier components of the object.\\n\\nSo the essential idea here is that MRI imaging works in k-space, and by adjusting the gradient pulses — dephasing first, then rephasing with frequency encoding — you can guarantee full coverage. This is how the k-space theorem is applied in MRI. And remember, in our setup, phase encoding is along the vertical direction, while frequency encoding is along the horizontal direction. Together, they fill the k-space grid, ensuring that the reconstructed image contains all the spatial information of the object.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only.

In other words, instead of starting at zero, all the frequency components now begin with a negative k x value. Then, as time increases during the readout, the trajectory sweeps across k-space and eventually moves into the positive side. By doing this, you cover the entire rectangular region of k-space, centered around the origin.\\nThis is important because, according to the Nyquist sampling theorem, you need to cover the full bandwidth of frequencies to accurately reconstruct the image. If your sampling region is too narrow, you will miss some Fourier components, and that leads to aliasing or artifacts in the reconstructed image. By carefully choosing the dephasing and rephasing gradients, you make sure that this rectangular region in k-space is wide enough to include all of the significant Fourier components of the object.\\n\\nSo the essential idea here is that MRI imaging works in k-space, and by adjusting the gradient pulses — dephasing first, then rephasing with frequency encoding — you can guarantee full coverage. This is how the k-space theorem is applied in MRI. And remember, in our setup, phase encoding is along the vertical direction, while frequency encoding is along the horizontal direction. Together, they fill the k-space grid, ensuring that the reconstructed image contains all the spatial information of the object.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only.
