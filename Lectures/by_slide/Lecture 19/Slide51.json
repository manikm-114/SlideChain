Unlike clinical MRI scanners that are designed for human patients, preclinical MRI systems are mainly used for small animals such as mice, rats, or rabbits.

The extremely high magnetic field strength of 9.4 Tesla gives very high resolution and sensitivity, allowing researchers to visualize fine structural details that would not be possible at lower field strengths. With this scanner, scientists can measure anatomical structures, functional activity, and even molecular processes, all non-invasively.\\n\\nPreclinical MRI scanners like this one play a vital role in translational medicine, serving as a bridge between laboratory discoveries and clinical applications.
