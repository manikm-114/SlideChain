The signal is proportional to the factors k x times x and k y times y, and this immediately shows that the signal we measure is essentially a Fourier transformation. For any fixed time point during readout, the time t sets a specific value of k x, while k y is determined by the strength of the gradient G y and the duration of the phase-encoding step, tau p e. In other words, the frequency-encoding factor is traced out by letting time run during readout, which sweeps continuously along one line in k-space, while the phase encoding only gives one value of k y per line, and this is why we need multiple phase-encoding steps. By repeating the experiment with many different gradient strengths for G y, we can step through multiple values of k y, gradually filling the two-dimensional k-space. This is the basis of Fourier imaging.\\n\\nOn the slide, you can see the formal definitions written explicitly: k x equals gamma over two pi times G x times t, and k y equals gamma over two pi times G y times tau p e. Substituting these into the signal equation, we get that S of k x, k y is proportional to the double integral over the slice of rho of x comma y times e to the minus j two pi times open parenthesis k x x plus k y y close parenthesis d x d y. This is shown as equation four point four nine, and it is the central mathematical statement of Fourier MRI. Notice that in your textbook, the two pi factor is missing inside the exponential, and this is actually a common oversight in many texts, including mine and in my lectures. In reality, the two pi must be included to match the conventional definition of the Fourier transform, so keep that in mind as a small but important detail.\\n\\nThe essential point here is that, through phase encoding and frequency encoding, the data we measure in MRI are already Fourier components. This is very different from X-ray imaging, where the Fourier slice theorem has to be used: there, each projection profile must be one-dimensionally transformed to draw a radial line in Fourier space, and extra processing is needed. In MRI, the signals themselves directly populate k-space, which means the Fourier information is collected naturally as part of the measurement. Each phase-encoding step contributes to the vertical direction in k-space, and the continuous readout under the frequency-encoding gradient sweeps across the horizontal direction.

From the following slide text,\\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nSo, if we call the whole term for frequency encoding, G x times t, simply k x, and we call the phase-encoding term k y, then the previous formula we derived can be rewritten in this k-space format. The signal is proportional to the factors k x times x and k y times y, and this immediately shows that the signal we measure is essentially a Fourier transformation. For any fixed time point during readout, the time t sets a specific value of k x, while k y is determined by the strength of the gradient G y and the duration of the phase-encoding step, tau p e. In other words, the frequency-encoding factor is traced out by letting time run during readout, which sweeps continuously along one line in k-space, while the phase encoding only gives one value of k y per line, and this is why we need multiple phase-encoding steps. By repeating the experiment with many different gradient strengths for G y, we can step through multiple values of k y, gradually filling the two-dimensional k-space. This is the basis of Fourier imaging.\\n\\nOn the slide, you can see the formal definitions written explicitly: k x equals gamma over two pi times G x times t, and k y equals gamma over two pi times G y times tau p e. Substituting these into the signal equation, we get that S of k x, k y is proportional to the double integral over the slice of rho of x comma y times e to the minus j two pi times open parenthesis k x x plus k y y close parenthesis d x d y. This is shown as equation four point four nine, and it is the central mathematical statement of Fourier MRI. Notice that in your textbook, the two pi factor is missing inside the exponential, and this is actually a common oversight in many texts, including mine and in my lectures. In reality, the two pi must be included to match the conventional definition of the Fourier transform, so keep that in mind as a small but important detail.\\n\\nThe essential point here is that, through phase encoding and frequency encoding, the data we measure in MRI are already Fourier components. This is very different from X-ray imaging, where the Fourier slice theorem has to be used: there, each projection profile must be one-dimensionally transformed to draw a radial line in Fourier space, and extra processing is needed. In MRI, the signals themselves directly populate k-space, which means the Fourier information is collected naturally as part of the measurement. Each phase-encoding step contributes to the vertical direction in k-space, and the continuous readout under the frequency-encoding gradient sweeps across the horizontal direction. By combining both, we directly fill k-space, and after applying the inverse Fourier transform, we reconstruct the final image.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only.
