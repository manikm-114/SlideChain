TE works similarly: shorter echo times reduce T2 contrast but keep signal strong, while longer echo times allow more T2 differences to emerge but at the cost of weaker signals. These parameters, TE and TR, are the main levers we adjust to create different kinds of MRI contrast.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only.
