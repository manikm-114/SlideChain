This torque does not flip the magnetic moment directly into alignment with the field. Instead, it causes the moment to precess, meaning it rotates around the axis of the magnetic field, very much like a spinning top under the influence of gravity.\\n\\nThe rate of this precession is called the Larmor frequency. The Larmor frequency depends on two things: the strength of the magnetic field and a constant called the gyromagnetic ratio, which is unique for each type of nucleus.\\nMathematically, we write the Larmor frequency as omega zero equals gamma times B zero. Here, omega zero represents the precession frequency, gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, and B zero is the strength of the magnetic field.\\n\\nThis relationship tells us that the stronger the field, the faster the precession.
