Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nNow let’s talk about the T2 effect, which is also called transverse relaxation or dephasing.\\nAfter we apply a ninety-degree pulse, the net magnetization lies entirely in the transverse plane, along the x-y plane. At that initial moment, all of the tiny magnetic moments of individual protons are lined up together, pointing in the same direction.\\n\\nBut over time, each of those protons experiences slightly different local magnetic fields. Some of them precess a little faster, and others precess a little slower. As a result, they gradually drift out of phase with one another.\\nWhen that happens, their contributions begin to cancel out. The net transverse magnetization shrinks, even though each proton is still spinning.\\nOn the graph at the bottom, you can see this process clearly. The transverse magnetization starts at its maximum value and then decays exponentially toward zero as the moments become more and more dephased.\\n\\nThis is the essence of the T2 relaxation process: it measures how quickly the spins lose phase coherence in the transverse plane, leading to signal decay.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only.
