When the change in a vector is always perpendicular to the vector itself, the result is circular motion. In the orbital case, the velocity vector keeps changing direction, while in angular momentum, the same principle applies: torque causes a perpendicular change in angular momentum, and so the angular momentum vector itself traces out a circle.\\n\\nThis is the key point to understand precession: a perpendicular change leads to circular motion.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only.
