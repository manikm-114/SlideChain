From the following slide text,\\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nTo get a rough idea of how MRI works, let’s look at it step by step. \\n\\nMagnetic resonance imaging—MRI for short—can be modeled in the following way. First, consider this conducting loop of wire. The magnetic dipole moment is defined as the current going through the wire, times the cross-sectional area enclosed by the wire, times a unit vector perpendicular to that surface area. So the magnetic dipole moment points in the perpendicular direction, like this.\\n\\nNow, a proton is believed to spin on its axis at the subatomic level. Because it’s spinning, the magnetic dipole moment can be thought of as the sum of many tiny circulating currents. Whenever you take a dipole moment and place it in an external magnetic field, the dipole experiences a torque. That torque is given by the equation: tau equals mu cross B. In words: the torque equals the magnetic dipole moment crossed with the magnetic field.\\nWhat this means is that the dipole moment will tend to align with the magnetic field. Imagine here is the B-field, and here is the dipole moment. When you take the cross product, you get a torque out of the board. That torque causes the dipole to rotate in this direction. The dipole will try to line up with the external B-field, but it won’t line up completely. The angular momentum of the spinning top—so to speak—prevents complete alignment. Instead, it undergoes precession, just like a spinning top wobbling around a vertical axis.\\nSo, think of the proton as a spinning top. It rotates on its axis, but also precesses about an axis that is parallel to the external magnetic field.\\nNow, let’s introduce radiation. We emit an electromagnetic wave laterally, toward the precession axis. For simplicity, I’ve drawn only the magnetic component, oscillating in and out of the board as it travels laterally. If the angular frequency of this radiation equals the angular frequency of precession, resonance occurs.\\n\\nWe define the Larmor angular frequency:\\u000bomega L equals gamma times B-naught.\\nHere gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio. For a proton, gamma is about two-point-sixty-seven times ten to the eighth radians per second per tesla. To convert from radians per second to hertz, we divide by two-pi. So,\\ntwo-pi f L equals gamma times B-naught.\\nOr equivalently:\\u000bf L equals gamma over two-pi, times B-naught.\\nNumerically, this works out to about forty-two megahertz per tesla.\\nSo, the frequency of the applied radiation matches the precession frequency of the proton. Whenever the proton comes around to a certain point, the applied B-field is right there to interact with it. The torque tends to flatten the precession, step by step, as the proton keeps rotating.\\nWhen the radiation is turned off, the proton flips back to its original motion, precessing around the external magnetic field axis. This is the fundamental mechanism of magnetic resonance. Historically, it was called nuclear magnetic resonance, but later changed to simply magnetic resonance—mostly for public perception, since “nuclear” tends to worry people.\\n\\nNow let’s take a group of hydrogen atoms. The body contains a large amount of hydrogen, because we are mostly water—H2O. Initially, the dipole moments of hydrogen protons are randomly oriented. When we apply an external magnetic field, the protons tend to align with the field, precessing around its axis.\\nWhen we emit radiation laterally, as we discussed before, the protons flatten out. Then, when the radiation is turned off, the protons flip back. Think of this like a spring being released. As they flip back, they emit radiation. That emitted radiation can be detected and processed to form an image.\\nIn 1973, a breakthrough came from Paul Lauterbur—he showed that you could actually use this principle to create images. The idea was: take a subject, place them inside a tube with a strong superconducting magnet, on the order of five tesla. The magnetic field is aligned along the axis of the tube, so all the protons line up and precess.\\n\\nThen, apply a secondary magnetic field that produces a gradient along the axis of the tube. That means the magnetic field is slightly stronger at one end, weaker at the other. Because the Larmor frequency depends on the field strength, different positions along the tube correspond to different precession frequencies.\\nFor example, at a position one-point-three meters down the tube, the magnetic field might be B1, slightly larger than B0. Substituting B1 into the equation, you find a different resonance frequency. By tuning the applied radiation frequency, only protons at that slice will resonate and emit radiation. This gives spatial localization.\\nEngineers extended this idea. By using different gradient coils—like the saddle coil shown here—they can create gradients not only along the Z-axis, but also in the X and Y directions. That way, we can localize signals to small cubes of tissue, called voxels, inside the body.\\n\\nFinally, only tissues containing hydrogen—meaning water and fat—produce signal. That’s why MRI works so well for imaging soft tissues in the human body.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only.

Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nTo get a rough idea of how MRI works, let’s look at it step by step. \\n\\nMagnetic resonance imaging—MRI for short—can be modeled in the following way. First, consider this conducting loop of wire. The magnetic dipole moment is defined as the current going through the wire, times the cross-sectional area enclosed by the wire, times a unit vector perpendicular to that surface area. So the magnetic dipole moment points in the perpendicular direction, like this.\\n\\nNow, a proton is believed to spin on its axis at the subatomic level. Because it’s spinning, the magnetic dipole moment can be thought of as the sum of many tiny circulating currents. Whenever you take a dipole moment and place it in an external magnetic field, the dipole experiences a torque. That torque is given by the equation: tau equals mu cross B. In words: the torque equals the magnetic dipole moment crossed with the magnetic field.\\nWhat this means is that the dipole moment will tend to align with the magnetic field. Imagine here is the B-field, and here is the dipole moment. When you take the cross product, you get a torque out of the board. That torque causes the dipole to rotate in this direction. The dipole will try to line up with the external B-field, but it won’t line up completely. The angular momentum of the spinning top—so to speak—prevents complete alignment. Instead, it undergoes precession, just like a spinning top wobbling around a vertical axis.\\nSo, think of the proton as a spinning top. It rotates on its axis, but also precesses about an axis that is parallel to the external magnetic field.\\nNow, let’s introduce radiation. We emit an electromagnetic wave laterally, toward the precession axis. For simplicity, I’ve drawn only the magnetic component, oscillating in and out of the board as it travels laterally. If the angular frequency of this radiation equals the angular frequency of precession, resonance occurs.\\n\\nWe define the Larmor angular frequency:\\u000bomega L equals gamma times B-naught.\\nHere gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio. For a proton, gamma is about two-point-sixty-seven times ten to the eighth radians per second per tesla. To convert from radians per second to hertz, we divide by two-pi. So,\\ntwo-pi f L equals gamma times B-naught.\\nOr equivalently:\\u000bf L equals gamma over two-pi, times B-naught.\\nNumerically, this works out to about forty-two megahertz per tesla.\\nSo, the frequency of the applied radiation matches the precession frequency of the proton. Whenever the proton comes around to a certain point, the applied B-field is right there to interact with it. The torque tends to flatten the precession, step by step, as the proton keeps rotating.\\nWhen the radiation is turned off, the proton flips back to its original motion, precessing around the external magnetic field axis. This is the fundamental mechanism of magnetic resonance. Historically, it was called nuclear magnetic resonance, but later changed to simply magnetic resonance—mostly for public perception, since “nuclear” tends to worry people.\\n\\nNow let’s take a group of hydrogen atoms. The body contains a large amount of hydrogen, because we are mostly water—H2O. Initially, the dipole moments of hydrogen protons are randomly oriented. When we apply an external magnetic field, the protons tend to align with the field, precessing around its axis.\\nWhen we emit radiation laterally, as we discussed before, the protons flatten out. Then, when the radiation is turned off, the protons flip back. Think of this like a spring being released. As they flip back, they emit radiation. That emitted radiation can be detected and processed to form an image.\\nIn 1973, a breakthrough came from Paul Lauterbur—he showed that you could actually use this principle to create images. The idea was: take a subject, place them inside a tube with a strong superconducting magnet, on the order of five tesla. The magnetic field is aligned along the axis of the tube, so all the protons line up and precess.\\n\\nThen, apply a secondary magnetic field that produces a gradient along the axis of the tube. That means the magnetic field is slightly stronger at one end, weaker at the other. Because the Larmor frequency depends on the field strength, different positions along the tube correspond to different precession frequencies.\\nFor example, at a position one-point-three meters down the tube, the magnetic field might be B1, slightly larger than B0. Substituting B1 into the equation, you find a different resonance frequency. By tuning the applied radiation frequency, only protons at that slice will resonate and emit radiation. This gives spatial localization.\\nEngineers extended this idea. By using different gradient coils—like the saddle coil shown here—they can create gradients not only along the Z-axis, but also in the X and Y directions. That way, we can localize signals to small cubes of tissue, called voxels, inside the body.\\n\\nFinally, only tissues containing hydrogen—meaning water and fat—produce signal. That’s why MRI works so well for imaging soft tissues in the human body.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only.
