Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\\n\\nUser:\\nSLIDE_TEXT:\\nHere is the very general idea behind how MRI works. At the center of the system, we have a large superconducting magnet. This magnet creates a very strong, stable magnetic field. Around it, we place gradient coils, which allow us to vary the magnetic field in different directions and make tomographic, or slice-by-slice, imaging possible.\\n\\nIn addition, we use radiofrequency coils, or RF coils. These coils send radio waves to disturb the alignment of the protons in the body. When the protons are tipped away from alignment, they begin to precess, and in doing so, they emit their own radiofrequency signals. The RF coils then detect these signals.\\n\\nWith the help of signal processing and mathematical reconstruction, we turn these detected signals into detailed images. Right now, it may sound abstract, but as we go deeper into the lecture, we will carefully unfold each of these components. For now, just keep in mind the big picture: a strong magnet, gradient coils for spatial encoding, RF coils for excitation and detection, and signal reconstruction to form the final images.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only.
