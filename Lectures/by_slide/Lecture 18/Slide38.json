In that frame, the B-one field looks stationary, and the magnetization vector simply rotates around it. That’s why we often describe RF excitation as “flipping” the magnetization into the transverse plane.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return pure JSON only.

In the steady state, this vector points along the z-axis, aligned with the static magnetic field B-zero.\\n\\nWhen we apply an additional magnetic field, called B-one, along the x-axis, something interesting happens. The cross product between the magnetization vector and B-one produces a torque. This torque acts in the direction perpendicular to both vectors, and it causes the magnetization to tip away from the z-axis.\\nBut remember, the system is still precessing around the main magnetic field. So the magnetization doesn’t simply tilt once and stop—it spirals away from the z-axis, tracing out a cone. The longer we apply the B-one field, the further the vector tips, increasing the flip angle.\\n\\nThis picture is very convenient to describe using the concept of a rotating frame. In that frame, the B-one field looks stationary, and the magnetization vector simply rotates around it. That’s why we often describe RF excitation as “flipping” the magnetization into the transverse plane.\\n\\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\\n- Return JSON only.
