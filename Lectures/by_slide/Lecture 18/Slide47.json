In this case, the longitudinal magnetization, which we call M z, has been tipped entirely into the transverse plane, so it starts at zero. Over time, it recovers back toward its equilibrium value, which we call M naught, and it does so in an exponential fashion.\\n\\nOn the right side, we see the case of a one-hundred-eighty-degree pulse. Here, the longitudinal magnetization is flipped completely upside down, starting at negative M naught. From there, it also recovers exponentially back to M naught.\\nThis exponential recovery is the hallmark of T1 relaxation. The recovery speed depends on the tissue type, because different tissues exchange energy with their environment—the so-called spin-lattice interaction—at different rates.\\n\\nSo, to summarize: T1 tells us how quickly a tissue’s magnetization realigns with the main magnetic field, B zero.
