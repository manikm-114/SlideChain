Here we come to the Lorentz force, a very fundamental concept. The equation says that the total force on a charged particle is equal to the electric force plus the magnetic force. Mathematically, F equals q times E plus q times v cross B. Here, q is the charge, E is the electric field, v is the velocity of the particle, and B is the magnetic field.

This means that when an electric charge moves through a magnetic field, it experiences a force. The direction of that force is given by the cross product, which makes it perpendicular to both the velocity and the magnetic field.
At a deeper level, the Lorentz force can actually be derived from Maxwell’s equations, showing that Maxwell’s framework is completely self-contained. Together, these equations govern all of electromagnetism: electric and magnetic fields, waves, and interactions.

For us, the important point is to become familiar with these concepts—Maxwell’s equations, electromagnetic interactions, and the Lorentz force—because they are the physical foundation for MRI signal generation and detection.
