Now let’s look at how we measure T2 relaxation using the spin-echo method.
We begin with a ninety-degree pulse that tips the net magnetization into the transverse plane. Right away, the spins begin to dephase because of small differences in their local magnetic environments. Faster spins move ahead, slower spins lag, and the overall signal decays quickly with a time constant that looks like T2 star.

But here is the clever trick: at a certain time, we apply a one-hundred-eighty-degree pulse. This flips all the spins over, so that the ones that were leading are now behind, and the ones that were lagging are now in front. As time continues, these spins re-converge, and at a later time, they come back into phase. When that happens, we see the spins add constructively and produce a strong signal, known as the spin echo.
The height of this echo decays with the true T2 relaxation time, not with T2 star. By repeating the sequence with different time delays, we can track how quickly the echo signal diminishes, and from that, extract the T2 constant.

This technique is both simple and powerful: it cancels out static inhomogeneities in the magnetic field and isolates the true spin-spin relaxation, which is exactly what T2 represents.
