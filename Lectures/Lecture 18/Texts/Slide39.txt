In the laboratory frame, the magnetization vector doesn’t just tip smoothly into the transverse plane. Instead, it traces out a spiral path, because while it is flipping down, it is also precessing around the z-axis at the Larmor frequency. So what we observe looks like a helical trajectory.

But there is a much simpler way to describe this motion. Instead of staying in the laboratory coordinate system, we can shift into a rotating frame of reference. This is a coordinate system that rotates at exactly the Larmor frequency.

In this rotating frame, the spiral disappears. The magnetization no longer seems to precess—it simply tilts, or “flips,” into the transverse plane. This makes the description of RF excitation much more intuitive.

That’s why, throughout MRI physics, we often switch between the laboratory frame and the rotating frame. The physics is the same, but in the rotating frame, the mathematics and the visualization become much simpler.
