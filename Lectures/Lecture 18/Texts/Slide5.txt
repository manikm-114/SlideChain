Now, let’s go through some important milestones. MRI is unique because it can provide two types of information. On one hand, it gives us anatomical information, very much like CT, by showing the structure of soft tissues. On the other hand, it can measure blood oxygenation levels, which adds functional information. That combination is what makes MRI so powerful.
The story begins in 1946, when Bloch at Stanford and Purcell at Harvard discovered nuclear magnetic resonance. For this work, they received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1952. At that time, NMR was mainly used to measure signals from a whole sample.
Then in 1973, Lauterbur at Stony Brook University introduced the idea of magnetic resonance imaging. The key innovation was to use gradient magnetic fields, which made it possible to turn NMR from a bulk measurement into a tomographic imaging technique. Now we could form images with pixels and voxels instead of just an overall signal. This breakthrough eventually earned Lauterbur and colleagues the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 2003.
By the late 1970s, the first human MRI images were produced. In the early 1980s, commercial MRI systems became available. Then, in 1993, functional MRI was developed, allowing us to look at brain activity through blood oxygenation changes.
And now, we are in the era of large-scale brain initiatives, where MRI continues to be at the center of neuroscience and clinical imaging.
