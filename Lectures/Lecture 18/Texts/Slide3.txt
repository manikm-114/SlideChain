Let me start by giving you both a preview and a review. The preview is like a big picture of what MRI physics is about. I will provide you with some basic knowledge and introductory ideas that will help you understand the more detailed content later. 

So first, let’s take a look at this overall framework. We will begin with the physical foundation, then move on to signal generation, and finally discuss signal decay. This roadmap will guide us through today’s lecture.
