Now let’s focus on the proton itself. A proton is a positively charged particle, and one of its most important properties is spin. You can think of spin as being similar to a tiny top rotating on its axis. Because the proton is both spinning and charged, it behaves like a little current loop. And any current loop produces a magnetic field.

This is why we say a spinning proton has a magnetic moment. You can picture it as a miniature bar magnet, with a north pole and a south pole.
If we take just one proton—say, from a hydrogen atom in a water molecule—it acts like a tiny magnet. But in the body, we have countless protons, and in the absence of an external magnetic field, their magnetic moments point in random directions. As a result, they cancel out, and there is no overall magnetic effect.
However, when we apply a strong external magnetic field, something very interesting happens. These magnetic moments begin to align, and that alignment is what 

MRI relies on generating signals. We will come to that point soon.
