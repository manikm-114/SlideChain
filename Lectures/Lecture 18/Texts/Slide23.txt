When we place spinning protons, each with a magnetic moment, into a strong external magnetic field, their energy levels split. This phenomenon is called the Zeeman effect.

The magnetic moment of a proton can only align in one of two possible ways with respect to the external field: parallel or antiparallel. In the parallel case, the magnetic moment lines up with the field, and this state has lower energy. In the antiparallel case, the magnetic moment points against the field, and this state has higher energy.

So, instead of a continuous range of orientations, quantum mechanics restricts protons to just these two discrete states. The energy difference between them is proportional to the strength of the magnetic field.
This is similar to a mechanical analogy: imagine trying to rotate a bar magnet in a strong external field. If you align it with the field, that is the stable, low-energy position. If you force it to oppose the field, that requires work and corresponds to a higher-energy state.

This splitting of energy levels is fundamental in MRI. It is the small difference in populations between protons in the lower-energy parallel state and the higher-energy antiparallel state that generates the net magnetization we rely on to produce signals.
