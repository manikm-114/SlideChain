Electricity and magnetism are deeply connected. Whenever an electric current flows through a wire, it generates a magnetic field around that wire. If you coil the wire into loops, the magnetic fields from each loop add together, creating a much stronger overall magnetic field.
This is the principle behind an electromagnet. By sending current through a coil, we can generate powerful magnetic fields, and the more loops of wire we use, the stronger the field becomes.

This connection between electricity and magnetism is fundamental to MRI. The giant superconducting magnets used in MRI are essentially coils carrying current, producing extremely strong and stable magnetic fields needed for imaging.
