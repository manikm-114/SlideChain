Now let’s talk about the T2 effect, which is also called transverse relaxation or dephasing.
After we apply a ninety-degree pulse, the net magnetization lies entirely in the transverse plane, along the x-y plane. At that initial moment, all of the tiny magnetic moments of individual protons are lined up together, pointing in the same direction.

But over time, each of those protons experiences slightly different local magnetic fields. Some of them precess a little faster, and others precess a little slower. As a result, they gradually drift out of phase with one another.
When that happens, their contributions begin to cancel out. The net transverse magnetization shrinks, even though each proton is still spinning.
On the graph at the bottom, you can see this process clearly. The transverse magnetization starts at its maximum value and then decays exponentially toward zero as the moments become more and more dephased.

This is the essence of the T2 relaxation process: it measures how quickly the spins lose phase coherence in the transverse plane, leading to signal decay.
