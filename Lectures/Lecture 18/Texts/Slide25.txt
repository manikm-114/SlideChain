Now, let’s bring in some mathematics through the Boltzmann distribution, which describes how protons split between the two energy states.

We can write the ratio of the number of protons in the anti-parallel state to the number in the parallel state as:
“N anti-parallel divided by N parallel equals the exponential of negative delta E over k T.”
Here, delta E is the energy difference between the two states, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature in kelvins.

Substituting the expression for delta E, we get:
“N anti-parallel divided by N parallel equals the exponential of negative gamma times h times B-zero, divided by two pi k T.”
With a first-order approximation, this becomes:
“N anti-parallel over N parallel is approximately equal to one minus gamma h B-zero over two pi k T.”

What does this mean in practice? It means the populations of the two states are nearly equal, with only a tiny excess in the parallel, or lower-energy state.
The net MRI signal comes from this small population difference. If we take the difference in numbers between the parallel and anti-parallel states, we get:
“Delta N equals N s times gamma h B-zero divided by four pi k T.”
Here, N s is the total number of protons in the body. The key point is that this difference is extremely small. For example, at a magnetic field strength of one and a half tesla, out of about one million protons, only a handful contribute to the net signal.

So, although the individual imbalance is tiny, the collective contribution of billions and billions of protons is what makes MRI signals measurable.
