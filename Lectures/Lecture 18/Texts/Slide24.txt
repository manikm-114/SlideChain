When protons are placed in a strong magnetic field, they split into two energy states: the parallel state, which has lower energy, and the antiparallel state, which has higher energy. This is the Zeeman effect.

The energy of each state can be expressed as:
E equals negative mu z times B naught.
Here, mu z is the longitudinal component of the magnetic moment, and B naught is the strength of the external magnetic field.
Because mu z can take on two values, plus gamma h over four pi, or minus gamma h over four pi, the energies are:
E equals plus or minus gamma times h times B naught, divided by four pi.
The difference between these two levels is what we call delta E, and it is given by:
Delta E equals gamma times h times B naught, divided by two pi.
This difference is critical because it sets the resonance condition. Only when the energy of the applied radiofrequency matches this delta E can protons flip between the two states.

At body temperature, slightly more protons are in the lower energy parallel state compared to the higher energy antiparallel state. This small imbalance is what produces the net magnetization that we detect in MRI.
