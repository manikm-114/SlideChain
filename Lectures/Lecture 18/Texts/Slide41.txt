We describe the change of the magnetization vector M of t with time.The Bloch equation is:
dM of t over d t equals M of t cross gamma times B of t, minus R times the difference of M of t and M zero.
Here:
gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio,
B of t is the magnetic field,
M zero is the equilibrium magnetization,
and R is the relaxation operator that encodes T1 and T2 processes.
Now, if we expand this into components, we get three equations:
For the z component:dM z over d t equals gamma times the quantity M x times B y, minus M y times B x, minus the difference M z minus M zero divided by T1.
For the x component:dM x over d t equals gamma times the quantity M y times B z, minus M z times B y, minus M x divided by T2.
For the y component:dM y over d t equals gamma times the quantity M z times B x, minus M x times B z, minus M y divided by T2.
