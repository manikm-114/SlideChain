From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere we see the behavior of magnetic poles. Just like electric charges, magnets also interact depending on their polarity. Every magnet has two poles: a north pole and a south pole. Like poles repel each other, while opposite poles attract.\n\nThis is a simple but powerful analogy. You can think of it like teamwork: if two people have the same role, they may push against each other, but if they have complementary skills, they come together to form a stronger team. In the same way, the north and south poles naturally attract and stabilize one another.\nThese basic principles of magnetism, combined with the behavior of electric charges, are the foundation for understanding the electromagnetic interactions that drive MRI physics.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
