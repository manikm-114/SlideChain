From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThink about this in terms of a revolving door. If you just walk up and push the door randomly, sometimes your push helps it move, and sometimes it cancels out—because your force is not always aligned in the right way.\nBut if you keep pushing at exactly the right rhythm, always perpendicular to the door, you will steadily drive it around in a smooth motion. That is resonance: applying a force at the right frequency so that every push adds up.\n\nIn MRI, the same idea holds. The RF signal has to be applied at the exact precessional frequency—the Larmor frequency. If it matches, then every cycle of the RF field keeps nudging the spins in the same direction. In the rotating frame, this no longer looks like an oscillating wave. Instead, it looks like a steady force, a constant torque, applied to the magnetization vector.\nThat constant torque is what tips the magnetization away from the z-axis. It is what allows us to rotate the vector from its equilibrium position into the transverse plane, or even further.\n\nSo the revolving door is a nice analogy: push in rhythm with the rotation, and the system responds strongly. Push out of rhythm, and the effect cancels out.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
