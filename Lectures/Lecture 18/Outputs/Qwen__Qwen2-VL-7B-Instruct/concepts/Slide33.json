From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow we bring everything together and look at the steady state of magnetization.\n\nEarlier, we talked about the tiny surplus of protons in the lower-energy parallel state compared with those in the higher-energy anti-parallel state. That difference is very small, but when multiplied by the enormous total number of protons in the body, it adds up to a measurable effect.\nFor a single proton, the magnetic moment can be expressed as gamma times h-bar over two. But now, instead of just one proton, we have on the order of 10\nto the power of 23 protons, and only a small fraction contributes to the net imbalance. Multiplying that tiny difference by the large population gives us the bulk magnetization.\n\nWe call this net magnetization M naught. It represents the collective contribution of all the protons and points along the direction of the external field B naught.\nIn this steady state, the magnetization only has a longitudinal component. That means M z equals M naught, while the transverse components M x and M y are both zero.\n\nEven though individual protons are still precessing and flipping between parallel and anti-parallel orientations, when you take the average, the only surviving component is along the z-axis. This is what we refer to as the steady-state magnetization.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
