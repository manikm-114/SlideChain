Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThat wraps up the first part of our discussion. Next, we will move more systematically, following closely along with the structure in your textbook.\nIn the first part, we covered some foundational physics: angular momentum, magnetic moments from a quantum mechanical perspective, magnetization in the classical sense, and the fascinating but at first mysterious idea of precession. These are the building blocks.\n\nThe magnetic moment represents the behavior of individual protons at the quantum level. Magnetization describes how many of these tiny moments add up into a collective vector that we can measure in bulk. And precession explains how that vector behaves in an external magnetic field.\nTogether, these ideas form the physical foundation that allows us to understand signal generation, relaxation, and ultimately the imaging sequences that make MRI possible.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
