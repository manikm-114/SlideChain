Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nToday, we’re going to begin a new chapter on the physical principles of Magnetic Resonance Imaging, or MRI. This is Lecture 18 in our series.\n\nMRI is one of the most powerful tools in modern biomedical imaging, and in this session, we’ll look at the physics closely that makes MRI work. We’ll build up from the physical foundations including Maxwell’s equations, through the concepts of magnetization and precession, all the way to how signals are generated and detected. Along the way, we’ll also discuss key parameters, such as proton density, T1 and T2, and how they enable image contrasts.\nOkay, let’s get started with MRI physics.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}",
