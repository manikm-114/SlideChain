Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, let’s bring in some mathematics through the Boltzmann distribution, which describes how protons split between the two energy states.\n\nWe can write the ratio of the number of protons in the anti-parallel state to the number in the parallel state as:\n“N anti-parallel divided by N parallel equals the exponential of negative delta E over k T.”\nHere, delta E is the energy difference between the two states, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature in kelvins.\n\nSubstituting the expression for delta E, we get:\n“N anti-parallel divided by N parallel equals the exponential of negative gamma times h times B-zero, divided by two pi k T.”\nWith a first-order approximation, this becomes:\n“N anti-parallel over N parallel is approximately equal to one minus gamma h B-zero over two pi k T.”\n\nWhat does this mean in practice? It means the populations of the two states are nearly equal, with only a tiny excess in the parallel, or lower-energy state.\nThe net MRI signal comes from this small population difference. If we take the difference in numbers between the parallel and anti-parallel states, we get:\n“Delta N equals N s times gamma h B-zero divided by four pi k T.”\nHere, N s is the total number of protons in the body. The key point is that this difference is extremely small. For example, at a magnetic field strength of one and a half tesla, out of about one million protons, only a handful contribute to the net signal.\n\nSo, although the individual imbalance is tiny, the collective contribution of billions and billions of protons is what makes MRI signals measurable.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
