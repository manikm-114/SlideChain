Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere we define torque and see how it relates to angular momentum. Linear momentum is straightforward: it is mass times velocity. According to Newton’s second law, the time derivative of linear momentum is force. That means if you want to change momentum, you need to apply a force, which changes velocity.\nNow, when we move from linear motion to rotational motion, we deal with angular momentum. Angular momentum is defined as the cross product of the position vector r and the linear momentum p. So, L equals r cross p.\n\nTo change angular momentum, we need torque. Torque is also defined through a cross product: r cross F, the position vector crossed with the applied force. Just as force is the reason linear momentum changes, torque is the reason angular momentum changes.\nThis is really just an extension of Newton’s second law into rotational dynamics. The derivative of angular momentum with respect to time equals torque. In other words, torque is the rotational analog of force.\n\nThis connection shows why the cross product is essential. It is not only a mathematical operation but also the key to describing how forces lead to changes in rotation. This principle is central in understanding precession and magnetization, which we will soon connect back to MRI physics.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
