From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo far, we’ve spent quite some time on the physical foundation. That’s good, because now you have a solid grounding in the physics behind MRI — angular momentum, magnetic moment, precession, and magnetization. All of this is essential because without that base, the next steps would be very difficult to follow.\n\nNow we’re ready to move forward and talk about how the MRI signal is actually generated. This is the transition point — from theory into application. The key question becomes: once the protons are aligned and precessing in the magnetic field, how do we disturb them in a controlled way and measure the response?\nThat’s where the radiofrequency pulse comes in. By applying a carefully tuned RF pulse, we can perturb the magnetization vector and create a measurable signal. In the upcoming slides, I’ll explain this process step by step — beginning with RF perturbation, then the Bloch equations that describe the dynamics, and finally, how we detect the free induction decay signal.\n\nSo, let’s pay attention to the next slide — this is where MRI really comes alive.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
