From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThis is a classic example of precession, and it is the same principle that applies in MRI when the magnetic moment of protons precesses in a magnetic field.\nThink of a spinning top. The top’s axis of rotation points in one direction, representing the angular momentum. If no external force acts on it, the top will keep spinning steadily, just as a moving object keeps moving in a straight line.\n\nNow, if a force is applied — here, gravity acting at the center of mass — it produces a torque. Torque is given by the cross product of the lever arm vector r and the force vector F. In this case, r cross F points into the page. That means the torque is perpendicular to the angular momentum.\nWhen the torque is perpendicular, it doesn’t stop the motion or flip the top over directly. Instead, it causes a small change, delta L, that is also perpendicular to the original angular momentum. This sideways change makes the tip of the angular momentum vector trace out a circle.\nSo instead of falling over, the spinning top precesses—it wobbles around in a circular path.\n\nAnd that is the key insight: whenever a spinning object with angular momentum experiences a torque perpendicular to it, the result is precession. In MRI, the proton’s magnetic moment behaves just like this spinning top, precessing around the direction of the external magnetic field.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
