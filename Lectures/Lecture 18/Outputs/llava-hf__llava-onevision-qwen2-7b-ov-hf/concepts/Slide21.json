From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere we arrive at two key concepts you must know: angular momentum, usually written as P, and the magnetic moment, written as miu.\n\nFrom mechanics, angular momentum describes the rotation of a particle—in this case, the proton. You can think of it as a spinning top. Just as torque can change the angular momentum of a top, external influences can change the angular momentum of a proton.\nBut unlike a simple spinning top, the proton also carries an electric charge. Because of this, it has not only mechanical properties but also electromagnetic ones. Its magnetic behavior is summarized by the magnetic moment miu.\n\nThe beautiful part is that these two quantities—angular momentum and magnetic moment—are directly linked. The relationship is miu equals gamma times P, where gamma is a constant called the gyromagnetic ratio.\nQuantum mechanics adds one more layer: angular momentum cannot take on any arbitrary value but is quantized. It is expressed in terms of the spin quantum number, I. For a proton, I equals one-half, so the angular momentum follows a specific formula.\n\nThe main takeaway is this: the proton’s mechanical rotation and its electromagnetic behavior are tied together in a very simple and elegant way. This link forms the basis of how MRI exploits proton spins to generate signals.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
