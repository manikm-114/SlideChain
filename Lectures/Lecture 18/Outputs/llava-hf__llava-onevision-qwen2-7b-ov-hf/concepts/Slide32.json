From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow we move from individual protons to the idea of magnetization.\nEach proton carries a magnetic moment, and as we have discussed, these moments precess around the external magnetic field. In the population of protons, slightly more occupy the lower-energy state, aligned parallel to the magnetic field, while slightly fewer are in the higher-energy, anti-parallel state. This imbalance, even though very small, is crucial.\n\nBecause the magnetic moments are vectors, those that are opposite to each other will cancel out in the transverse plane. What remains is a small excess of protons in the parallel state, and when we add up all of their contributions, we obtain a single net vector pointing along the direction of the magnetic field. This is what we call the net magnetization vector, often denoted as M.\nFrom this point on, instead of worrying about the behavior of individual protons, we can focus on this collective magnetization vector. We can treat it as a classical vector that can tilt, rotate, or precess, just like a spinning top. This makes it much easier to understand the physics and to design MRI pulse sequences.\n\nSo, magnetization is the bridge from the microscopic quantum world of spins to the macroscopic signals we use in MRI.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
