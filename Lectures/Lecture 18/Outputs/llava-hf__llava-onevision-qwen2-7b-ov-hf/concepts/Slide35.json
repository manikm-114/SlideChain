From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo here is the key motivation for MR signal generation. We have this net magnetization vector, which is called M-naught. It reflects the water and lipid content in the body, because that’s where most of the hydrogen protons are found. That sounds great, but the important question is: how do we actually measure M-naught?\nIf you just leave M-naught alone in its steady state, it aligns with the main magnetic field and stays constant in time. A static field like this will not generate any measurable electrical signal. Remember, electromagnetic induction only works when the magnetic field is changing. A constant magnetization produces nothing in our detection coil.\n\nThe key idea is this: if we can flip M-naught away from its alignment with the main field, then it will gain a transverse component. That transverse part does not just sit there — it precesses, meaning it rotates around the axis of the main magnetic field. This rotating transverse magnetization produces an alternating magnetic field. An alternating field is exactly what we need, because it induces an electrical signal in the detection coil.\n\nThis was the breakthrough that launched nuclear magnetic resonance. It was discovered in nineteen forty-six by Felix Bloch at Stanford and Edward Purcell at Harvard, and their work was recognized with the Nobel Prize in Physics in nineteen fifty-two.\nSo the essential trick is: flip the net magnetization, create a transverse component, let it precess, and detect the alternating signal that comes out. This is the foundation of MRI signal generation.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
