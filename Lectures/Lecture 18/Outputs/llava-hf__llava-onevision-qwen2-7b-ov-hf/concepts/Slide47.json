From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s take a closer look at the T1 effect.\nT1 describes how the longitudinal magnetization, that is, the component along the z-axis, gradually returns to its equilibrium value after being disturbed by a radiofrequency pulse.\n\nOn the left side of the figure, we see what happens after a ninety-degree pulse. In this case, the longitudinal magnetization, which we call M z, has been tipped entirely into the transverse plane, so it starts at zero. Over time, it recovers back toward its equilibrium value, which we call M naught, and it does so in an exponential fashion.\n\nOn the right side, we see the case of a one-hundred-eighty-degree pulse. Here, the longitudinal magnetization is flipped completely upside down, starting at negative M naught. From there, it also recovers exponentially back to M naught.\nThis exponential recovery is the hallmark of T1 relaxation. The recovery speed depends on the tissue type, because different tissues exchange energy with their environment—the so-called spin-lattice interaction—at different rates.\n\nSo, to summarize: T1 tells us how quickly a tissue’s magnetization realigns with the main magnetic field, B zero. And these differences in T1 times are one of the key sources of image contrast in MRI.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
