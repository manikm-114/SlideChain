From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo, we are still on schedule. If you look at the course outline, we have already covered topics such as Fourier series, signal processing, CT reconstruction, and nuclear imaging. \n\nNow, we are moving into MRI materials. Today’s focus is on MRI physics, which is the foundation for understanding how MRI systems generate and detect signals. This will prepare us for the next lectures, where we will go deeper into MRI techniques, systems, and applications.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"Fourier series\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"signal processing\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"CT reconstruction\", \"category\": \"reconstruction\"},\n    {\"term\": \"nuclear imaging\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"MRI physics\", \"category\": \"physics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"MRI techniques\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"MRI systems\", \"category\": \"instrumentation\"},\n    {\"term\": \"MRI applications\", \"category\": \"modality\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"If you look at the course outline, we have already covered topics such as Fourier series, signal processing, CT reconstruction, and nuclear imaging.
