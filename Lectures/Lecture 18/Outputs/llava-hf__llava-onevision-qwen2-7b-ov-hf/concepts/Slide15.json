From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo far, we have seen that an electric current can generate a magnetic field. But the reverse is also true: a changing magnetic field can generate an electric current.\nHere’s how it works. Imagine you have a conducting loop. If nothing changes in the magnetic field passing through the loop, no current flows. But if you insert a magnet into the loop, or pull it out, the magnetic field inside the loop changes. This change induces a current in the loop.\n\nThis is Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction. The induced current always acts to oppose the change that caused it, a principle known as Lenz’s law. So if you try to increase the magnetic field, the induced current will create a field that resists that increase. If you decrease the magnetic field, the induced current will create a field that resists the decrease.\nThis interplay between electricity and magnetism is fundamental for MRI. The scanner excites protons using magnetic and radiofrequency fields, and then relies on induced currents in coils to detect the returning signals.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
