From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s look at the cross product. When you take two vectors, say vector a and vector b, their cross product is not a scalar like the dot product, but instead a new vector. The magnitude of this vector is equal to the length of a times the length of b times the sine of the angle between them. The direction of the result is perpendicular to the plane formed by a and b, determined by the right-hand rule.\n\nSo while the dot product gives us a projection, the cross product gives us an orthogonal vector that carries both magnitude and direction. This operation is not just a mathematical trick—it has deep physical meaning. In MRI physics, cross products appear naturally when we describe torques, angular momentum, and precession, making them essential to understanding the behavior of magnetic moments in an external field.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
