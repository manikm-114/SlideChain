From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s distinguish between T2, T2 prime, and T2 star.\nThe loss of phase coherence in the transverse magnetization can arise from two different mechanisms. The first is the so-called pure T2 decay, which comes from intrinsic spin–spin interactions inside the tissue. This is a physiological and biological effect, and it represents the fundamental limit of how long spins can stay in phase with one another.\n\nThe second contribution comes from spatial variations in the magnetic field strength inside the body. In practice, no magnet is perfectly uniform. There are always small imperfections in the main field, B zero. In addition, different tissues have slightly different magnetic susceptibilities, especially at boundaries between air and tissue, or bone and tissue. These local variations cause spins to accumulate extra phase shifts, further accelerating the loss of coherence. This additional contribution is represented by T2 prime.\nWhen we put these together, the overall transverse relaxation time we observe is called T2 star. Mathematically, the rate of decay of T2 star is the sum of the rates of T2 and T2 prime. That is, one over T2 star equals one over T2 plus one over T2 prime.\n\nSo in summary:\nT2 reflects fundamental spin–spin interactions.\nT2 prime reflects field inhomogeneity and susceptibility effects.\nT2 star combines both, and it is the effective decay time we actually measure in many MRI sequences.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
