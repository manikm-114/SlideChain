From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nWe can now look at RF excitation from the quantum mechanical point of view.\u000bImagine we have two energy levels: a lower energy state and a higher energy state. When we send in a radiofrequency wave at the resonance frequency, that wave carries just the right amount of energy to promote a proton from the lower state up to the higher state.\n\nBut once the RF excitation stops, those protons in the higher energy state cannot stay there forever. They naturally relax back down to the lower energy state, which is the more stable configuration. As they do so, the excess energy is released. Importantly, the released energy is in the form of the same radiofrequency signal that was used to excite them.\n\nThis emitted signal is what we detect externally. It is the key step that allows us to convert the microscopic spin transitions of hydrogen protons into a measurable macroscopic MR signal.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
