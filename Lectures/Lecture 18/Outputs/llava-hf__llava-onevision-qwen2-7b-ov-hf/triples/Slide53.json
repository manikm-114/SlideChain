Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s visualize what’s happening in an inversion recovery sequence.\nWe start with the net magnetization pointing up along the Z-axis at its equilibrium value, M₀. Then, we apply a one-hundred-eighty-degree pulse, which flips it completely upside down, to minus M₀. From this inverted state, the magnetization begins to relax back toward equilibrium. Over time, the longitudinal component regrows along the Z-axis following the T1 recovery curve.\nAt some chosen inversion time, which we call TI, we apply a ninety-degree pulse. This rotates whatever longitudinal magnetization has recovered into the transverse plane. Once in the transverse plane, it generates a measurable free induction decay, or FID signal, that is subject to T2 star decay.\nBy repeating this process with different inversion times and recording the signals, we can map out the full recovery curve. Then, using a logarithmic fit, we extract the T1 relaxation time.\nSo, in short, this diagram shows how the one-hundred-eighty-degree inversion, the recovery period, and the ninety-degree readout pulse together make it possible to measure T1 directly.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
