Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nWhen a proton with a magnetic moment is placed in a strong external magnetic field, its behavior becomes quantized. Classically, you might imagine that the magnetic moment could point in any direction. But quantum mechanics tells us that only certain orientations are allowed.\n\nSpecifically, we focus on the longitudinal component of the magnetic moment, meaning the part aligned with the external field. For the proton, this component can take on only two values: one parallel to the field and one antiparallel. These values are determined by the nuclear magnetic quantum number, m I, which for a proton can be plus one-half or minus one-half.\n\nSo, the z-component of the magnetic moment, miu z, equals plus or minus gamma times Planck’s constant divided by four pi. This means the magnetic moment is never perfectly aligned—it is always tilted slightly. But it is restricted to these two possible states.\nThis quantum restriction, the fact that the magnetic moment can only take on discrete orientations, is what gives rise to the fundamental energy levels we use in MRI.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
