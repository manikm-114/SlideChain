Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nElectricity and magnetism are deeply connected. Whenever an electric current flows through a wire, it generates a magnetic field around that wire. If you coil the wire into loops, the magnetic fields from each loop add together, creating a much stronger overall magnetic field.\nThis is the principle behind an electromagnet. By sending current through a coil, we can generate powerful magnetic fields, and the more loops of wire we use, the stronger the field becomes.\n\nThis connection between electricity and magnetism is fundamental to MRI. The giant superconducting magnets used in MRI are essentially coils carrying current, producing extremely strong and stable magnetic fields needed for imaging.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"electric current\", \"p\":\"generates\", \"o\":\"magnetic field\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":1.0, \"evidence\":\"Whenever an electric current flows through a wire, it generates a magnetic field around that wire.\"}\n  ]\n}",
