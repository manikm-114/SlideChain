Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet me start by giving you both a preview and a review. The preview is like a big picture of what MRI physics is about. I will provide you with some basic knowledge and introductory ideas that will help you understand the more detailed content later. \n\nSo first, let’s take a look at this overall framework. We will begin with the physical foundation, then move on to signal generation, and finally discuss signal decay. This roadmap will guide us through today’s lecture.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) physics\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"Let me start by giving you both a preview and a review.
