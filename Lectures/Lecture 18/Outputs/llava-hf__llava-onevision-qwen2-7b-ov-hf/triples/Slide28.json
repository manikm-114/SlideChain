Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThis idea is not too hard to grasp if we think about orbital motion.\nTake the example of the Moon orbiting around the Earth, or a satellite orbiting a planet. You might wonder: why doesn’t it just fall straight down? The answer is that there is always a centripetal force pointing inward, toward the center of the orbit.\n\nThat centripetal force doesn’t change the magnitude of the velocity, but it does change its direction. Because the force is always perpendicular to the velocity vector, it continuously “bends” the path, keeping the satellite in circular motion rather than letting it fly off in a straight line.\nMathematically, the centripetal force is equal to mass times velocity squared, divided by the radius: F equals m v squared over r.\n\nNow connect this to angular momentum. When the change in a vector is always perpendicular to the vector itself, the result is circular motion. In the orbital case, the velocity vector keeps changing direction, while in angular momentum, the same principle applies: torque causes a perpendicular change in angular momentum, and so the angular momentum vector itself traces out a circle.\n\nThis is the key point to understand precession: a perpendicular change leads to circular motion.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1].
