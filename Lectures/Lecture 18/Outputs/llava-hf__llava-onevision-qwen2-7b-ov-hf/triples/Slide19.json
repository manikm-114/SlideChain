Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s quickly revisit some high school chemistry to ground ourselves. Here is the basic atomic structure. In the outer shell, we have electrons moving around. In reality, their positions are described by probabilities, but we often picture them as orbiting the nucleus.\nInside the nucleus, we find two main types of particles: protons and neutrons. Protons carry positive charges, while neutrons are electrically neutral. Since all the protons are positively charged, they would naturally repel each other. But they are held together by the strong nuclear force, which balances out the electromagnetic repulsion and creates a stable nucleus.\n\nThis balance of forces is what allows atoms to exist in a stable form. And it is precisely these nuclear properties—especially the behavior of protons—that are central to MRI, because the hydrogen nucleus, which is just a single proton, is the main source of signal in magnetic resonance imaging.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"proton\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"hydrogen nucleus\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"The hydrogen nucleus, which is just a single proton, is the main source of signal in magnetic resonance imaging.\"}\n  ]\n}",
