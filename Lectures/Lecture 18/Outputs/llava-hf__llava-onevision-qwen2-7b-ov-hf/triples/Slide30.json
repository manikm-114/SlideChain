Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s carefully look at how we can compute the precessional frequency.\nWhen a magnetic moment, which we call mu, is placed at an angle to the external magnetic field B, it experiences a torque. This torque can be written as mu cross B zero. That torque is what drives the angular momentum to change over time.\nMathematically, we can say: torque equals the derivative of angular momentum with respect to time. In other words, dP by dt equals mu cross B zero.\n\nHere, P is the angular momentum. Because protons both have mass and positive charge, their spinning motion not only produces angular momentum but also generates a tiny current loop. That current loop is associated with a magnetic moment. And so, whenever the magnetic moment is not aligned with the magnetic field, it feels a torque.\nNow, to connect the pieces: magnetic moment and angular momentum are directly proportional. That means the change in angular momentum is tied to the change in magnetic moment.\nTo see how this becomes precision, consider a very small angular change, which we call d phi. For such small changes, the sine of d phi can be approximated as just d phi. With this, we can relate torque to the rate of change of the angular position.\nSo the angular frequency of precession, written as omega, is equal to the torque divided by the magnitude of angular momentum times sine theta. If you expand the cross product, you eventually find that omega equals gamma times B zero.\n\nHere, gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, a constant specific to the nucleus.\nThis final result is extremely important: the precessional frequency is directly proportional to the strength of the magnetic field. In a stronger field, the spins precess faster. In a weaker field, they precess more slowly. This proportionality is the foundation of magnetic resonance.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
