Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThat wraps up the first part of our discussion. Next, we will move more systematically, following closely along with the structure in your textbook.\nIn the first part, we covered some foundational physics: angular momentum, magnetic moments from a quantum mechanical perspective, magnetization in the classical sense, and the fascinating but at first mysterious idea of precession. These are the building blocks.\n\nThe magnetic moment represents the behavior of individual protons at the quantum level. Magnetization describes how many of these tiny moments add up into a collective vector that we can measure in bulk. And precession explains how that vector behaves in an external magnetic field.\nTogether, these ideas form the physical foundation that allows us to understand signal generation, relaxation, and ultimately the imaging sequences that make MRI possible.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"angular momentum\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"individual protons at the quantum level\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"Magnetization describes how many of these tiny moments add up into a collective vector that we can measure in bulk.\"}\n  ]\n}",
