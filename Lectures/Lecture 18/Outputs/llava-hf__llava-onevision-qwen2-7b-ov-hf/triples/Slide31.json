Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nIt’s often much easier to demonstrate precision than to explain it with equations.\nHere you see a gyroscope. Its circular motion around the stand is precession. This motion results from the combination of two effects: the downward force of gravity and the angular momentum around the spinning axis.\n\nNotice how the wheel does not simply fall. Instead, because of torque, it precesses around the point where it is supported. If I increase the downward force—for example, by adding the weight of a wrench to the axle—you can see that the precession frequency increases.\n\nThis is the same principle that applies in MRI. The frequency of precession is directly linked to the strength of the magnetic field. Stronger forces or fields lead to faster precession. We call this frequency encoding, and it is the foundation for how MRI gathers spatial information.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"gyroscope\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"precession\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"Its circular motion around the stand is precession.
