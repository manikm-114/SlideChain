Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s quickly review some high school physics to set the stage. Electric charges interact through forces. If you place two charges in space, the nature of those charges determines how they behave. Like charges, meaning both positive or both negative, repel each other. Opposite charges, one positive and one negative, attract each other.\n\nThe strength of this interaction is given by Coulomb’s law. The force is proportional to the product of the two charges, divided by the square of the distance between them. So the closer the charges, the stronger the force.\nThis simple idea about electric forces will be important when we connect electricity and magnetism, and eventually link these basic interactions to the physics of MRI.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"electric charge\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"force\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"Electric charges interact through forces.\"}\n  ]\n}",
