Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow that we have covered how MRI signals are generated and detected, the next step is to understand how those signals decay. This part is crucial, because the decay mechanisms — specifically T1 and T2 relaxation — are what ultimately give us image contrast.\n\nSo, in the final section of this lecture, we will look more closely at the physics behind T1 and T2. We will also see how these relaxation times can be measured, and how pulse sequences such as inversion recovery and spin echo are designed to take advantage of them.\n\nUp to this point, our discussion has focused on the overall process of signal generation and detection. But to move from signals to images, we need to understand relaxation. T1 and T2 are the keys that translate raw MRI physics into meaningful image contrast.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
