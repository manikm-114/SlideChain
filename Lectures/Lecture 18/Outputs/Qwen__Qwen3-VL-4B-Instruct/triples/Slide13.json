Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThe Earth itself has a magnetic field, but it is actually quite weak. The Earth’s field is about half a Gauss. To put this into perspective, one Tesla equals ten thousand Gauss. So the Earth’s field is only about fifty microtesla, which is tiny compared to what we use in MRI.\n\nMRI scanners rely on magnets that are tens of thousands of times stronger. Clinical MRI systems typically operate at one and a half Tesla, three Tesla, or even higher in research settings. These strong fields are essential for aligning enough protons in the body to generate measurable signals.\nSo while the Earth’s magnetic field is important for navigation and protecting us from solar radiation, it is far too weak for imaging. For MRI, we need very powerful superconducting magnets. And now, let’s connect electric and magnetic forces together, because in physics, they are two sides of the same coin.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
