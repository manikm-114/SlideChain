Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAt this stage, we can summarize how T1 and T2 relaxation describe the time evolution of magnetization in MRI.\n\nFirst, consider the longitudinal component, which we usually call M z. After a radiofrequency pulse, it does not instantly return to equilibrium. Instead, it recovers gradually, following an exponential curve. Mathematically, we say that M z of time equals M naught multiplied by one minus e to the power of negative t over T1. In plain words, this means the recovery depends on a time constant, T1, which tells us how quickly the spins realign with the main magnetic field.\n\nNext, for the transverse components, which are M x and M y, these decay over time. Their rate of decay is described by the time constant T2. The equations are written as d M x over d t equals minus M x divided by T2, and d M y over d t equals minus M y divided by T2. In other words, both x and y components shrink exponentially toward zero, at a rate determined by T2.\n\nSo, together, T1 and T2 give us a semi-quantitative model for MRI. T1 governs how fast the longitudinal magnetization recovers, and T2 governs how fast the transverse magnetization disappears. Both processes follow exponential curves, but with different time constants.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
