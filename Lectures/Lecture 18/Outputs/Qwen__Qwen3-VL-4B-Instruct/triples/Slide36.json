Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nWhen the magnetization vector is in steady state, it is balanced. No magnetic field is changing, so no signal can be detected. But once we flip it, we break that balance. Now there is a transverse component of magnetization. This transverse part does not stay still — it undergoes circular motion, what we call precession. And this precessing transverse component produces an alternating magnetic field, which can then be measured through electromagnetic induction, as described by Maxwell’s equations.\n\nSo how do we flip the magnetization to break the balance? To answer that, we look at the energy difference between the parallel state and the anti-parallel state of the protons. Earlier, we derived this difference and called it delta E.\nThis energy difference must be supplied by an incoming electromagnetic wave. And the energy carried by a photon is equal to Planck’s constant times the frequency. That means the frequency of the applied radiofrequency wave has to exactly match the energy gap between the two spin states.\nWhen you rearrange the formulas, you find that the resonant frequency, written as f, is equal to gamma times B-zero divided by two pi. In terms of angular frequency, written as omega, the result is omega equals gamma times B-zero.\n\nThis is a fundamental result. It tells us that the Larmor precession frequency of the proton is identical to the frequency of the radiofrequency field we must apply to drive transitions between the parallel and the anti-parallel states.\nSo, from the quantum mechanical point of view, resonance occurs when the radiofrequency wave carries exactly the right energy to match that gap — and that is the basis of nuclear magnetic resonance.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
