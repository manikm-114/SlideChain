From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, let’s look at how T1 can be measured using the inversion recovery method.\nThe idea is to start with a one-hundred-eighty-degree pulse, which flips the net magnetization completely upside down along the negative Z-axis. Once it is inverted, we allow it to recover toward equilibrium during a delay time, which we call tau. During this period, the longitudinal magnetization gradually regrows toward its steady state, following the exponential recovery curve we discussed earlier.\n\nAt the end of the delay, we apply a ninety-degree pulse. This flips whatever longitudinal magnetization has recovered into the transverse plane, where it produces a measurable signal. By repeating this process with different values of tau, we can track how the magnetization regrows over time.\nMathematically, the detected signal follows the expression:\u000bS of tau equals M zero times the quantity one minus two times e to the power of minus tau over T1.\n\nBy fitting this recovery curve, we obtain the T1 relaxation time. In practice, this method gives a very robust way to measure T1 across different tissues, and it is the basis for many T1-weighted imaging protocols in MRI.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
