From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nWe describe the change of the magnetization vector M of t with time.\u000bThe Bloch equation is:\ndM of t over d t equals M of t cross gamma times B of t, minus R times the difference of M of t and M zero.\nHere:\ngamma is the gyromagnetic ratio,\nB of t is the magnetic field,\nM zero is the equilibrium magnetization,\nand R is the relaxation operator that encodes T1 and T2 processes.\nNow, if we expand this into components, we get three equations:\nFor the z component:\u000bdM z over d t equals gamma times the quantity M x times B y, minus M y times B x, minus the difference M z minus M zero divided by T1.\nFor the x component:\u000bdM x over d t equals gamma times the quantity M y times B z, minus M z times B y, minus M x divided by T2.\nFor the y component:\u000bdM y over d t equals gamma times the quantity M z times B x, minus M x times B z, minus M y divided by T2.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
