From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s quickly revisit some high school chemistry to ground ourselves. Here is the basic atomic structure. In the outer shell, we have electrons moving around. In reality, their positions are described by probabilities, but we often picture them as orbiting the nucleus.\nInside the nucleus, we find two main types of particles: protons and neutrons. Protons carry positive charges, while neutrons are electrically neutral. Since all the protons are positively charged, they would naturally repel each other. But they are held together by the strong nuclear force, which balances out the electromagnetic repulsion and creates a stable nucleus.\n\nThis balance of forces is what allows atoms to exist in a stable form. And it is precisely these nuclear properties—especially the behavior of protons—that are central to MRI, because the hydrogen nucleus, which is just a single proton, is the main source of signal in magnetic resonance imaging.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
