From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nTo wrap up today’s lecture, here is your homework assignment.\n\nFor problem 4.3, you will calculate the effects of different pulse sequences on thermal equilibrium magnetization. Your final answers should include the x, y, and z components of magnetization. The cases include a ninety-degree pulse about the x-axis, an eighty-degree pulse about the x-axis, two consecutive ninety-degree pulses about x and y, and finally, two consecutive eighty-degree pulses about x and y.\n\nFor problem 4.4, you will decide whether each statement is true or false and provide a brief explanation. These questions cover recovery of magnetization, the behavior of the static field B0, relaxation from the transverse to the longitudinal axis, and the interpretation of a short T1 relaxation time.\nThe due date is one working week from today.\n\nThank you for following along — we’ve covered a lot of ground, from the Bloch equations to T1 and T2 relaxation and even spin echo sequences. This sets the stage for more advanced imaging concepts in our next lecture.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
