The discrete Fourier transform we just discussed is actually a periodic function. Let’s understand why.

Think back to the Fourier series. In the time domain, a Fourier series is built from sinusoidal components — each one a sine or cosine wave. And by definition, each of these components is periodic. Whether we have just one frequency or many, the result will still be periodic.

Now, in this expression at the top, the left-hand side shows the Fourier series in the time domain, with terms involving t over capital T. On the right-hand side, we have an almost identical formula — but here the variable t has been replaced by u, and T has been replaced by P. This tells us that in the frequency domain, we also get a periodic function.

The periodicity comes directly from the fact that the Fourier transform of a sampled signal is made up of these repeating sinusoidal components. Each one repeats over and over, giving us a continuous function in the frequency domain that is also periodic.
This is exactly what we saw in the big picture earlier: when we sample in one domain, the Fourier transform becomes periodic in the other domain.
