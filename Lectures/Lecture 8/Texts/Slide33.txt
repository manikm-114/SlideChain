We just saw that FFT-based convolution gives us circular convolution by default, where the “neighboring” copies wrap around and interfere.

The simplest way to avoid that wrap-around is to make sure those neighbors are far enough away so they can’t overlap during the shift. That’s what zero padding does.
We take our original signals and append enough zeros to both so that the total length is at least N plus M minus 1, where N and M are the original lengths of the two sequences.
In this example, each signal is only 5 samples long, but we pad them out to length 16. Now, when we perform the FFT, multiply in the frequency domain, and take the inverse FFT, the “wrap-around” region is all zeros — so the result matches the direct, linear convolution exactly.

In other words, zero padding is like making your yard so wide that your neighbors are too far away to cause any trouble.
