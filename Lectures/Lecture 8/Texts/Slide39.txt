Before we wrap up, I want to highlight something that often feels like magic in signal processing.
A signal cannot be both time-limited and band-limited at the same time.
If a signal is strictly limited in time — meaning it exists only within a certain interval — its frequency spectrum will stretch infinitely.And if a signal is strictly limited in frequency — meaning it contains only a finite range of frequencies — then it must extend infinitely in time.

In practice, we often work with signals that are approximately time-limited and approximately band-limited.This approximation, along with clever techniques like sampling, zero padding, and windowing, allows us to do what might seem impossible — turning the “impossible” into something that works perfectly well for our needs.That’s the kind of “magic” you see every day in signal processing
