Now, let’s see what happens when we use zero padding.
We take our original signal and extend it in the time domain by adding a large number of zeros at the end.This does not change the actual information in the signal, but it does increase the total number of samples.
When we compute the Fourier transform of this longer sequence, the frequency spacing between the points in the spectrum becomes smaller.
This means we get a finer frequency grid — more points between zero and the Nyquist frequency.
As a result, when we plot the spectrum, both peaks — the one at one hundred hertz and the one at one hundred two point five hertz — are now represented much more accurately.
You can see that their amplitudes are correctly estimated, and the peaks are sharper.
So, zero padding is a simple but powerful trick for improving the visual resolution of your spectrum.It doesn’t actually add new information, but it lets you see the frequency components more clearly.
