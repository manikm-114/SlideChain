Now let’s step back and look at the big picture.Everything we’ve discussed so far seems to work perfectly — but there’s an important approximation hidden here.
We often say: if a signal is finite in time — meaning it has a limited duration — then its Fourier spectrum is also limited to a finite interval.
In reality, that’s not strictly true.If a signal is perfectly finite in the time domain, its spectrum will actually extend infinitely. It will get smaller and smaller as you move away from the center, but it never truly stops.
You might argue that if we take the frequency range from minus W to plus W, and make W large enough, the parts outside this range become so small that they can be ignored.And yes, in practical engineering, we often do that. But from a mathematical point of view, we have to be careful.

Why?Because when we discretize, the spectrum is periodically repeated — we get infinitely many copies of it.Even if a single copy has very small values far away from the center, those small values from every copy can add up.The further away a copy is, the less it contributes — but since there are infinitely many of them, the sum of all those tiny contributions might still be significant.
This is why convergence is not always guaranteed and why mathematical rigor is important when making these approximations.
