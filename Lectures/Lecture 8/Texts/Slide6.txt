Let’s look at a good case — when our sampling rate is high enough to meet the sampling theorem’s requirement.

The black curve here is our original, continuous signal. Think of it as the “true” signal. The blue points show where we took our samples — a limited number of values, spaced evenly in time.

Here’s the magic: if the sampling rate is greater than twice the maximum frequency in the signal — the Nyquist rate — then we can take these discrete samples and use the Shannon interpolation formula to reconstruct the original signal perfectly.
When we do that here, the reconstructed signal (shown in red) lies exactly on top of the original black curve. They match so perfectly that you can’t even see the difference.

This is the sampling theorem in action. For band-limited signals, as long as we sample fast enough, we can go back and forth between continuous and discrete forms without losing information. You can repeat this process over and over, with different sample sets, and it will work every time.
In short — with the right sampling rate, theory and practice agree perfectly.
