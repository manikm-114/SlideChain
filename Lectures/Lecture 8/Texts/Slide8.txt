Let’s step back and see the big picture.

There are really two parts here. On the top half, we have discretized the signal in the time domain. This means we start with a continuous signal, sample it at regular intervals, and get a discrete set of values — something we can store and process in a digital computer. If the sampling theorem is satisfied, this step causes no information loss.
But the story doesn’t end there. Even though our signal is now discrete in time, its Fourier spectrum is still continuous. And a continuous spectrum cannot be stored directly in a computer either.

That’s where the second part comes in — discretizing the spectrum. This is the central topic of this lecture. The idea is to take the continuous Fourier spectrum and multiply it by a periodic train of delta functions in the frequency domain. This multiplication in frequency corresponds to convolution in the time domain, which effectively copies our time-domain signal over and over again, spaced apart by a fixed period t.

In other words, sampling in one domain causes repetition — or duplication — in the other domain. When we discretize both the time-domain signal and the frequency-domain spectrum, we end up with a periodic structure in both domains.
The key point here is that now, both our signal in time and its spectrum in frequency are discrete and periodic. This makes them fully compatible with digital processing. And this is the foundation for moving toward the discrete Fourier transform.
