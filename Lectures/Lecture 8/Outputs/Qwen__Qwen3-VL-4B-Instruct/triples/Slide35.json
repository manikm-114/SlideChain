Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nIf you’d like to explore these ideas further, MathWorks has some excellent tutorials and examples in its documentation.\n\nThis particular page walks through the relationship between linear and circular convolution in MATLAB. It explains the key conditions under which the two are equivalent, and shows how zero padding can be used to make circular convolution behave like linear convolution.\n\nYou’ll also find clear MATLAB examples here — creating vectors, padding them to the right length, applying the FFT, multiplying in the frequency domain, and using the inverse FFT to get back to the time domain.\nSo, if you want to reinforce what we’ve just covered or see it implemented step-by-step, this is a great place to start.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": []\n}",
