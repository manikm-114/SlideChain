From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow we can state the discrete Fourier transform \n\nWe’ve sampled the signal at times\u000bt n equals to n divided by capital P, for n equals to 0, 1, …, N minus 1.\u000bWe’ll read the spectrum at frequencies\u000bu m equals to m divided by capital T, for m equals to 0, 1, …, N minus 1,\u000bwith N equals to T times P.\n\nThe DFT value at u m is\n“sum from n equals zero to N minus one, f of n over P, into e to the power of minus j, two pi, m n over N.”\nThis is just an inner product with a complex sinusoid of frequency index m.\u000bEach output is complex: its magnitude tells us how much of that frequency is present, and its angle (the phase) tells us the shift.\n\nA few quick anchors:\nt n equals to n over P are the time samples.\nu m equals to m over T are the frequency samples.\nThe exponential “e to the minus j two pi m n over N” is the rotating basis wave.\n\nNext, we’ll write the inverse DFT and see why a factor of one over N naturally appears so we can reconstruct the time samples exactly.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Reject filler or administrative text.\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\n      \"term\": \"t n equals to n divided by capital P, for n equals to 0, 1, …, N minus 1.\",\n      \"category\": \"signal_processing\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"u m equals to m divided by capital T, for m equals to 0, 1, …, N minus 1,\",\n      \"category\": \"frequency_domain\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"N equals to T times P.\",\n      \"category\": \"mathematics\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"sum from n equals zero to N minus one, f of n over P, into e to the power of minus j, two pi, m n over N.\",\n      \"category\": \"mathematics\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"This is just an inner product with a complex sinusoid of frequency index m.\",\n      \"category\": \"mathematics\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"Each output is complex: its magnitude tells us how much of that frequency is present, and its angle (the phase) tells us the shift.\",\n      \"category\": \"signal_processing\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"",
