From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nBefore we wrap up, I want to highlight something that often feels like magic in signal processing.\u000b\nA signal cannot be both time-limited and band-limited at the same time.\nIf a signal is strictly limited in time — meaning it exists only within a certain interval — its frequency spectrum will stretch infinitely.\u000bAnd if a signal is strictly limited in frequency — meaning it contains only a finite range of frequencies — then it must extend infinitely in time.\n\nIn practice, we often work with signals that are approximately time-limited and approximately band-limited.\u000bThis approximation, along with clever techniques like sampling, zero padding, and windowing, allows us to do what might seem impossible — turning the “impossible” into something that works perfectly well for our needs.\u000bThat’s the kind of “magic” you see every day in signal processing\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
