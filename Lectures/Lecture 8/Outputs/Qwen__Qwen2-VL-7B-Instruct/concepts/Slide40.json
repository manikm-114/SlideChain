From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s step back and look at the big picture.\u000bEverything we’ve discussed so far seems to work perfectly — but there’s an important approximation hidden here.\nWe often say: if a signal is finite in time — meaning it has a limited duration — then its Fourier spectrum is also limited to a finite interval.\u000b\nIn reality, that’s not strictly true.\u000bIf a signal is perfectly finite in the time domain, its spectrum will actually extend infinitely. It will get smaller and smaller as you move away from the center, but it never truly stops.\nYou might argue that if we take the frequency range from minus W to plus W, and make W large enough, the parts outside this range become so small that they can be ignored.\u000bAnd yes, in practical engineering, we often do that. But from a mathematical point of view, we have to be careful.\n\nWhy?\u000bBecause when we discretize, the spectrum is periodically repeated — we get infinitely many copies of it.\u000bEven if a single copy has very small values far away from the center, those small values from every copy can add up.\u000bThe further away a copy is, the less it contributes — but since there are infinitely many of them, the sum of all those tiny contributions might still be significant.\nThis is why convergence is not always guaranteed and why mathematical rigor is important when making these approximations.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
