From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s look at the special case where P equals exactly 2 w.\n\nSuppose our continuous signal is a pure sine wave with a frequency of 1 hertz. That means it completes exactly one cycle in one second. In the frequency domain, this is a band-limited signal — its maximum frequency is 1 hertz.\nIf we sample at exactly twice that frequency — so at 2 hertz — we meet the Nyquist rate exactly. In this case, we take two samples within each cycle. For a pure sinusoid, two unknowns fully describe it: the amplitude and the phase. In theory, two samples per cycle should be enough to determine those two unknowns.\n\nHowever, here’s the problem. Depending on where the samples fall, we might end up with the exact same sample value each time — for example, always sampling at the zero crossings of the sine wave. In that case, all our samples would be zero, and we would have no reliable way to determine the original signal.\n\nIn the Fourier domain, a pure sine wave corresponds to a pair of delta functions located at its positive and negative frequency components. When we sample at exactly 2 w, the duplicated spectra in the frequency domain just touch each other. If the touching points happen to be delta functions, those deltas overlap, and we can no longer separate the contributions from each one. Mathematically, it’s like having the equation X plus Y equals C — you know the sum, but not the individual values. This is an aliasing problem.\n\nThat’s why, in practice, sampling exactly at 2 w is risky. To be safe, we require PPP — the spacing between repeated spectra in frequency — to be slightly greater than 2 w. In other words, the sampling rate should be a little higher than twice the maximum frequency in the signal. This extra margin ensures that no overlap occurs, and reconstruction remains reliable.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
