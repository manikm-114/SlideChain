From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo, at this point, we have completed the main part of our discussion on Fourier analysis. In preparing these lectures, I’ve drawn from multiple resources — including this excellent textbook from Stanford University’s course “The Fourier Transform and Its Applications” — as well as my own insights and examples.\n\nThis textbook is designed for a full semester, and it’s quite comprehensive. My goal here has been to distill the most essential concepts for our biomedical engineering context. I’ve also added examples and explanations from other sources, as well as my own understanding, to create what I like to think of as a “BME version” of linear systems and Fourier analysis.\n\nSo far, you have all the core material. In the next lecture, our teaching assistant will go over some homework problems to help reinforce your understanding and sharpen your skills. After that, we’ll move on to our next major topic — network image quality.\nThat means the most mathematically challenging part of the course — Fourier analysis — is now behind us.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
