From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, let’s see what happens when we use zero padding.\u000b\nWe take our original signal and extend it in the time domain by adding a large number of zeros at the end.\u000bThis does not change the actual information in the signal, but it does increase the total number of samples.\nWhen we compute the Fourier transform of this longer sequence, the frequency spacing between the points in the spectrum becomes smaller.\u000b\nThis means we get a finer frequency grid — more points between zero and the Nyquist frequency.\nAs a result, when we plot the spectrum, both peaks — the one at one hundred hertz and the one at one hundred two point five hertz — are now represented much more accurately.\u000b\nYou can see that their amplitudes are correctly estimated, and the peaks are sharper.\nSo, zero padding is a simple but powerful trick for improving the visual resolution of your spectrum.\u000bIt doesn’t actually add new information, but it lets you see the frequency components more clearly.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
