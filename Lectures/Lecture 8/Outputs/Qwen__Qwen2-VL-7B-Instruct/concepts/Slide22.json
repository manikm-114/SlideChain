From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nUp to now, we’ve been writing our time samples as t-zero, t-one, t-two, and so on, and our frequency samples as u-zero, u-one, u-two, and so on. But when we work with sampled data, what really matters are the integer positions of these samples.\n\nSo, to make things simpler, we’ll label them using integers in square brackets. For example:\nf of zero means the value of the function at time sample t-zero.\nf of one means the value at time sample t-one.\nf of N minus one means the value at the last time sample, t N minus one.\nWe do the same in the frequency domain:\nf-hat of zero means the Fourier transform value at frequency sample u-zero.\nf-hat of one is at u-one.\nAnd so on, up to f-hat of N minus one.\n\nWith this notation, the discrete Fourier transform reads like this:\nf-hat of m  equals the sum from n equals zero to N minus one of f of n, multiplied by e to the power of minus j, two pi, m times n divided by N.\nHere, n is the index for time-domain samples, and m is the index for frequency components.\nEach term is just the sample value f of n  multiplied by a sinusoidal basis wave at frequency index m. Adding all those terms together gives the strength of that frequency in the signal — that’s our Fourier coefficient.\n\nWe can also see this as a matrix multiplication:\nThe time samples f of zero, f of one, …, f of N minus one form a column vector.\nThey are multiplied by an N-by-N matrix whose entries are these complex exponentials e to the power of minus j, two pi, m times n divided by N.\nThe result is another vector containing all the frequency samples f-hat of zero, f-hat of one, …, f-hat of N minus one.\nFor the first frequency index, m equals zero, every exponential equals one, so the first Fourier coefficient is simply the sum of all the time samples.\n\nLater, we’ll talk about scaling factors to account for the sampling step size, but for now this integer-index form keeps the DFT definition clean and easy to use.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Reject filler or administrative text.\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"integer indices\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"discrete Fourier transform\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"matrix multiplication\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"Fourier coefficient\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"sampling step size\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"DFT definition\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\n    \"To make things simpler, we’ll label them using integers in square brackets.\",\n    \"With this notation, the discrete Fourier transform reads like this.\",\n    \"We can also see this as a matrix multiplication.\",\n    \"For the first frequency index, m equals zero, every exponential equals one, so the first Fourier coefficient is simply the sum of all the time samples.\"\n  ]\n}",
