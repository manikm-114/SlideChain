From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThis picture shows the idea of zero padding in a visual way.\n\nOn top, the red triangles represent one signal, and the blue triangles represent the other. Without padding, these shapes are repeated periodically, so when you slide them for convolution, parts from the “neighboring copies” wrap around and interfere — that’s the circular convolution effect we saw earlier.\n\nNow, by adding enough zeros, we artificially extend the period. This pushes the neighboring copies farther apart, so when we perform the convolution, only the single red copy and the single blue copy overlap. The neighbors never get close enough to contribute.\nThe result is that our circular convolution now matches the linear convolution exactly — because there’s no wrap-around. The earlier mismatch happened simply because we didn’t have enough zeros, so the neighbors still overlapped.\n\nThis is the essence of zero padding: make the “yard” wide enough so your neighbors can’t mess up your calculation.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
