Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThis picture shows the idea of zero padding in a visual way.\n\nOn top, the red triangles represent one signal, and the blue triangles represent the other. Without padding, these shapes are repeated periodically, so when you slide them for convolution, parts from the “neighboring copies” wrap around and interfere — that’s the circular convolution effect we saw earlier.\n\nNow, by adding enough zeros, we artificially extend the period. This pushes the neighboring copies farther apart, so when we perform the convolution, only the single red copy and the single blue copy overlap. The neighbors never get close enough to contribute.\nThe result is that our circular convolution now matches the linear convolution exactly — because there’s no wrap-around. The earlier mismatch happened simply because we didn’t have enough zeros, so the neighbors still overlapped.\n\nThis is the essence of zero padding: make the “yard” wide enough so your neighbors can’t mess up your calculation.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"Zero Padding Illustrated\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}",
