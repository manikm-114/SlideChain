Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s restate the big idea in another way.\n\nWe start with a continuous function in the time domain, which we’ll call f of t. It has a continuous Fourier transform, capital F of u, in the frequency domain. These two are perfectly related — one can be transformed into the other with no loss of information.\n\nNow, if we sample f of t at the Nyquist rate or higher, we get a discrete version of the signal — here shown as g of t. And because our sampling rate satisfies the theorem, there’s no loss of information in moving from the continuous signal to its discrete version.\nThat discrete-time signal, g of t, also has its own Fourier transform — here represented as capital G of u. And again, as long as we have sampled properly, this discrete spectrum contains the same information as the continuous spectrum, capital F of u.\n\nThe key point is that the Fourier transform is an invertible process. That means moving from f of t to capital F of u, or from g of t to capital G of u, can be done in either direction without losing information — as long as the sampling theorem is respected.\n\nSo whether we choose to work in the continuous domain or in the discrete domain, we can perform equivalent signal analysis. The difference is that in the real world, our computers are digital. That means we do everything in the discrete domain — but thanks to the theory, we can be confident that our results match what we would get in the continuous world.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
