Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, let’s see what happens when we use zero padding.\u000b\nWe take our original signal and extend it in the time domain by adding a large number of zeros at the end.\u000bThis does not change the actual information in the signal, but it does increase the total number of samples.\nWhen we compute the Fourier transform of this longer sequence, the frequency spacing between the points in the spectrum becomes smaller.\u000b\nThis means we get a finer frequency grid — more points between zero and the Nyquist frequency.\nAs a result, when we plot the spectrum, both peaks — the one at one hundred hertz and the one at one hundred two point five hertz — are now represented much more accurately.\u000b\nYou can see that their amplitudes are correctly estimated, and the peaks are sharper.\nSo, zero padding is a simple but powerful trick for improving the visual resolution of your spectrum.\u000bIt doesn’t actually add new information, but it lets you see the frequency components more clearly.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"zero padding\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"Fourier transform\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"When we compute the Fourier transform of this longer sequence, the frequency spacing between the points in the spectrum becomes smaller.\"}\n  ]\n}",
