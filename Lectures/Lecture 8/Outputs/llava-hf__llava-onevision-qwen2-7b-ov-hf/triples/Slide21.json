Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow we can state the discrete Fourier transform \n\nWe’ve sampled the signal at times\u000bt n equals to n divided by capital P, for n equals to 0, 1, …, N minus 1.\u000bWe’ll read the spectrum at frequencies\u000bu m equals to m divided by capital T, for m equals to 0, 1, …, N minus 1,\u000bwith N equals to T times P.\n\nThe DFT value at u m is\n“sum from n equals zero to N minus one, f of n over P, into e to the power of minus j, two pi, m n over N.”\nThis is just an inner product with a complex sinusoid of frequency index m.\u000bEach output is complex: its magnitude tells us how much of that frequency is present, and its angle (the phase) tells us the shift.\n\nA few quick anchors:\nt n equals to n over P are the time samples.\nu m equals to m over T are the frequency samples.\nThe exponential “e to the minus j two pi m n over N” is the rotating basis wave.\n\nNext, we’ll write the inverse DFT and see why a factor of one over N naturally appears so we can reconstruct the time samples exactly.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1].
