Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nBefore we wrap up, I want to highlight something that often feels like magic in signal processing.\u000b\nA signal cannot be both time-limited and band-limited at the same time.\nIf a signal is strictly limited in time — meaning it exists only within a certain interval — its frequency spectrum will stretch infinitely.\u000bAnd if a signal is strictly limited in frequency — meaning it contains only a finite range of frequencies — then it must extend infinitely in time.\n\nIn practice, we often work with signals that are approximately time-limited and approximately band-limited.\u000bThis approximation, along with clever techniques like sampling, zero padding, and windowing, allows us to do what might seem impossible — turning the “impossible” into something that works perfectly well for our needs.\u000bThat’s the kind of “magic” you see every day in signal processing\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"signal\", \"p\":\"cannot be both time-limited and band-limited at the same time\",\n     \"o\":\"<signal>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":1.0, \"evidence\":\"A signal cannot be both time-limited and band-limited at the same time.\"}\n  ]\n}",
