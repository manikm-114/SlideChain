Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s now bring everything together in one big picture, but with a bit more detail.\n\nWe start with a continuous function, f of t, and its continuous Fourier spectrum, capital F of u. Our goal is to sample both the time domain and the frequency domain in a way that makes sense for digital processing.\n\nFirst, let’s ask: how many samples will we have in the time domain?\nThis depends on two things:\nThe sampling interval in time, delta-t. This is equal to one over capital P, where capital P is the spacing in the frequency domain. The smaller the delta-t, the more data points we collect.\nThe total duration of the signal, capital T. The longer we record, the more samples we have.\nThe total number of samples in the time domain — call it N — is simply the total duration T divided by delta-t. Since delta-t is one over P.\n\nWe can write:\u000bN equals T multiplied by P.\nNow let’s switch to the frequency domain.\nHere, the total span of one period in frequency is capital P. The sampling interval in frequency, delta-u, is equal to one over capital T. So the total number of samples in frequency over one period — call it M — is the total span P divided by delta-u. That’s again P multiplied by T.\nThis symmetry is important:\u000bThe number of data points in the time domain and the number of data points in the frequency domain are the same — both equal to P multiplied by T.\n\nSo whether we’re sampling in time or in frequency, the total number of samples is determined by the product of the total span in one domain and the sampling density in the other.\n\nThis is the balanced relationship that underlies the discrete Fourier transform, and it’s why we can move between time and frequency representations so efficiently in digital signal processing.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"Sampling interval in time, delta-t\", \"p\":\"depends_on\", \"o\":\"Sampling interval in frequency, delta-u\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"The smaller the delta-t, the more data points we collect.\"}\n  ]\n}",
