Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nOnce we have all the discrete Fourier coefficients — that is, f-hat of m  for m equals zero up to N minus one — we can recover the original sampled signal values f of n  by using the inverse discrete Fourier transform.\n\nIn words, the formula says:\nf of n  equals one over capital N, times the sum from m equals zero to N minus one of f-hat of m, multiplied by e to the power of plus j, two pi, m times n divided by N.\nHere, n is the time-sample index, and m is the frequency-sample index.\nThe plus sign in the exponent is important — it’s the opposite of the minus sign we used in the forward discrete Fourier transform. This sign change is what allows us to reverse the process.\n\nThe factor of one over capital N also plays a key role. When we computed f-hat of zero in the forward transform, we were summing all the time samples, but we didn’t average them. This factor in the inverse transform takes care of that averaging, so we get the correct values back.\nSome people prefer a symmetric version: instead of putting all the scaling in the inverse transform, they split it evenly — using one over the square root of N in both the forward and inverse formulas. This is purely a matter of definition; the math works either way.\n\nYou can also see this in matrix form:\nIn the forward transform, we multiply the time-sample vector by the Fourier matrix of complex exponentials.\nIn the inverse transform, we multiply the frequency-sample vector by the inverse of that matrix, which has the plus sign in the exponent and the one over N factor out front.\n\nWith these two formulas — forward and inverse — we can move back and forth between a discretized time-domain signal and its discretized frequency-domain spectrum, with no information loss, as long as the sampling theorem was satisfied in the first place.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
