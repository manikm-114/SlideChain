Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo, at this point, we have completed the main part of our discussion on Fourier analysis. In preparing these lectures, I’ve drawn from multiple resources — including this excellent textbook from Stanford University’s course “The Fourier Transform and Its Applications” — as well as my own insights and examples.\n\nThis textbook is designed for a full semester, and it’s quite comprehensive. My goal here has been to distill the most essential concepts for our biomedical engineering context. I’ve also added examples and explanations from other sources, as well as my own understanding, to create what I like to think of as a “BME version” of linear systems and Fourier analysis.\n\nSo far, you have all the core material. In the next lecture, our teaching assistant will go over some homework problems to help reinforce your understanding and sharpen your skills. After that, we’ll move on to our next major topic — network image quality.\nThat means the most mathematically challenging part of the course — Fourier analysis — is now behind us.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"Fourier analysis\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"Biomedical engineering\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"This textbook is designed for a full semester, and it’s quite comprehensive.
