  "raw_output": "user \nSystem:\nYou are extracting factual relations from a medical imaging lecture. Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHello everyone, in this lecture, we’ll continue our foundational story and focus on understanding the discrete Fourier transform, or DFT, and its inverse, the IDFT. These slides and my book draft will be your main reference, and they provide a clear, step-by-step path for following the key steps and get the main idea.\n\nThe content you see here is part of a larger foundation in medical imaging. Once you have a solid grasp of these concepts, it will be much easier to understand advanced topics like X-ray tomography, nuclear imaging, and MRI.\n\nFourier analysis is central to all of these areas. We’ll use it to analyze and process signals in both continuous and discrete forms, and to move back and forth between the time or spatial domain and the frequency domain, in either a continuous or discrete form.\n\nIn practice, we digitize signals and then perform operations such as convolution, Fourier transforms, and inverse Fourier transforms in one dimension, two dimensions, and beyond. This lecture will begin building the tools you need for that process.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"Fourier analysis\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"medical imaging\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"Fourier analysis is central to all of these areas.\"}\n  ]\n}",
