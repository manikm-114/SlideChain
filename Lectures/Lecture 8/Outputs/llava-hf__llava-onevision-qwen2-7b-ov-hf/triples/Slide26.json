Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThe second way to look at the discrete Fourier transform is from the perspective of harmonics.\nWhen we do a forward DFT, we can think of it as multiplying our vector of time samples by a square matrix of complex exponentials. This matrix acts like a rotation in a high-dimensional space — it changes our coordinates from the time-domain representation to the frequency-domain representation.\n\nThe set of Fourier basis functions — the sinusoids at different discrete frequencies — form an orthonormal basis. That means they are all perpendicular to each other in this mathematical space. The forward transform rotates our coordinates from the “time axis” basis to the “frequency axis” basis. The inverse transform simply rotates them back.\n\nThis idea generalizes. In one dimension, the Fourier basis is just sines and cosines. But in two or three dimensions, or on a sphere, we can define more complex sinusoidal patterns, called harmonics. On a sphere, these are the spherical harmonics — each one corresponding to a certain “frequency” pattern over the surface.\n\nThe key property is the same: if you take two different harmonics and compute their inner product, the result is zero — they are orthogonal. If you take one harmonic and do an inner product with itself, you get one — it’s normalized.\nSo whether we are talking about simple sines and cosines, or more complex spherical harmonics, the Fourier transform is still just expressing a signal in terms of an orthogonal set of basis functions, then rotating between these bases.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
