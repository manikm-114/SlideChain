Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nWe’re moving along right on track in our journey through this course.\u000b\nIf you’ve had the chance to preview the reading materials for today, that’s great — it will help you connect the concepts more quickly. If not, that’s fine too.\n\nJust follow along closely, and make time afterward to review the main ideas. Building this habit of reinforcing concepts as we go will make your understanding stronger and more intuitive, especially as the topics become more mathematical.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<SLIDE_TEXT>\",\"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<SLIDE_TEXT>\",\"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}",
