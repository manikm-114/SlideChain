Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow that our signal is discrete in time and aliasing is avoided, the next step is to discretize the Fourier spectrum.\nOn the right, we start with the continuous, periodic Fourier spectrum of our sampled signal. The peaks are separated because our time-domain sampling rate was high enough. That’s good — no overlap here.\n\nOur goal is to make the frequency domain discrete as well. To do that, we multiply the spectrum by a periodic train of impulses — shown here in green. This is just like what we did before in the time domain, but now we’re applying it in the frequency domain.\nMultiplication in the frequency domain corresponds to convolution in the time domain. So, when we apply this green impulse train to the spectrum, the effect in the time domain is that our discrete signal gets duplicated at regular intervals, spaced by capital T.\nHere, delta-u — the spacing between impulses in the frequency domain — equals one over capital T, where capital T is the period of each repeated signal in the time domain.\n\nAs before, we must choose our frequency-domain sampling rate carefully. The impulses in frequency must be close enough together — in other words, our spacing delta-u must be small enough — to avoid overlaps in the time domain. This is the same logic as before, just in the other domain.\n\nBy doing this, we end up with a signal that is discrete in both the time domain and the frequency domain. This is the essential step that brings us to the discrete Fourier transform, or DFT.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
