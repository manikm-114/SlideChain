Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s look at a good case — when our sampling rate is high enough to meet the sampling theorem’s requirement.\n\nThe black curve here is our original, continuous signal. Think of it as the “true” signal. The blue points show where we took our samples — a limited number of values, spaced evenly in time.\n\nHere’s the magic: if the sampling rate is greater than twice the maximum frequency in the signal — the Nyquist rate — then we can take these discrete samples and use the Shannon interpolation formula to reconstruct the original signal perfectly.\nWhen we do that here, the reconstructed signal (shown in red) lies exactly on top of the original black curve. They match so perfectly that you can’t even see the difference.\n\nThis is the sampling theorem in action. For band-limited signals, as long as we sample fast enough, we can go back and forth between continuous and discrete forms without losing information. You can repeat this process over and over, with different sample sets, and it will work every time.\nIn short — with the right sampling rate, theory and practice agree perfectly.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"Sampling rate\", \"p\":\"greater_than|greater_than_twice_the_max_frequency_in_the_signal\",\n     \"o\":\"Nyquist rate\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"if the sampling rate is greater than twice the maximum frequency in the signal — the Nyquist rate — then we can take these discrete samples and use the Shannon interpolation formula to reconstruct the original signal perfectly.\"}\n  ]\n}",
