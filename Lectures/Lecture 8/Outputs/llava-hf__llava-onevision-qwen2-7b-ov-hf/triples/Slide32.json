Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s look at a second example, and here’s where things get interesting.\n\nWe again compute convolution in two ways:\nFirst, the direct method in the time domain.\nSecond, the FFT-based method, multiplying in the frequency domain and taking the inverse FFT.\n\nThis time, the results are different. Why?\nIt comes down to the fact that in discrete Fourier analysis, our signals are treated as periodic, not single, isolated sequences, but infinitely repeated copies.\nImagine x as one segment in time, and y as another. In the continuous world, when we shift one relative to the other, we only overlap the part that exists in the original copy. But in the discrete Fourier model, when you shift, parts of one copy can wrap around and overlap with the start of the other copy.\nIt’s as if your “neighbor” signal is spilling into your yard — and at the same time, you’re spilling into your other neighbor’s yard on the left.\n\nThat wrap-around interaction is exactly what circular convolution means:\nThe signals are treated as if arranged around a circle.\nWhen you slide one past the end, it reappears at the other side.\nThe FFT-based convolution performs this circular convolution by default, which is why the result here doesn’t match the direct, linear convolution.\nLater, we’ll see how to avoid this wrap-around effect so the FFT method matches the true linear convolution.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"convolution\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"discrete Fourier analysis\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"In discrete Fourier analysis, our signals are treated as periodic, not single, isolated sequences, but infinitely repeated copies.\"}\n  ]\n}",
