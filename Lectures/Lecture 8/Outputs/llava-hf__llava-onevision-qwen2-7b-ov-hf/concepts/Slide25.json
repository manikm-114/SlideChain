From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThe factor of 1 over capital N comes directly from how the continuous Fourier transform becomes a discrete one when we sample.\n\nIn the continuous world, both the forward and inverse Fourier transforms are integrals. But when we digitize the process, we replace those integrals with sums. That’s what we see in this figure — the smooth area under the curve is replaced by a set of thin rectangular strips. Each strip has a height equal to the function value at a sample point, and a width equal to the sampling interval.\nIn the time domain, that width is delta-t, the spacing between time samples. In the frequency domain, it’s delta-u, the spacing between frequency samples.\n\nWhen we perform a forward Fourier transform, the discretization introduces a factor of delta-t. When we perform the inverse transform, the discretization introduces a factor of delta-u. Multiply those together, and you get delta-t times delta-u — which we know is equal to one over capital N.\nThis is why, in the inverse discrete Fourier transform, we include the 1 over N factor — it accounts for both steps of discretization: first in time, then in frequency.\n\nAnd remember, there’s one more difference between the forward and inverse formulas: the forward transform uses a minus sign in the exponent, and the inverse transform uses a plus sign. This sign change is what lets the two operations perfectly undo each other.\nSo, the 1 over N is there because of how sampling replaces integrals with sums in both domains. It’s the scaling factor that ensures the forward and inverse transforms work together exactly.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
