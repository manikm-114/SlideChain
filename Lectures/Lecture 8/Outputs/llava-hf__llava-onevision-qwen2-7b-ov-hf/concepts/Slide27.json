From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere we’re looking at a particular orthonormal basis used in Fourier analysis.\n\nOur basis functions have the form:\ne to the power of j, two pi, m times t divided by capital T\nwhere m is the frequency index.\nIf we take two of these basis functions, one with index m and the other with index n, and compute their inner product — meaning we integrate the product of one and the complex conjugate of the other over the full interval from zero to capital T — two things can happen:\n\nIf m and n are different, the integral is zero. That means the functions are orthogonal — they share no common component.\nIf m and n are the same, the integral is one. That means each basis function has a unit norm, or length equal to one.\nThis is exactly what “orthonormal” means: the functions are orthogonal to each other, and each one has length one.\n\nBecause the Fourier basis has this orthonormal property, we can represent any signal as a sum of these basis functions without losing information. And we can go back and forth between the time-domain representation and the frequency-domain representation using the discrete Fourier transform and its inverse, knowing that the relationship is exact when the sampling theorem is satisfied.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
