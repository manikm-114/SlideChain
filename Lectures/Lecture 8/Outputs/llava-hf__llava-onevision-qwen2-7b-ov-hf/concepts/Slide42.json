From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThis idea connects to the famous wheat and chessboard problem, which is a classic example of exponential growth.\n\nImagine a chessboard with sixty-four squares. On the first square, you place one grain of wheat. On the next square, you double it — two grains. On the third square, you double it again — four grains. Then eight, sixteen, thirty-two, and so on. By the time you fill all the squares, the total number of grains becomes unimaginably large — enough to cover the Earth with a thick layer of wheat.\nThis illustrates how quickly exponential growth can get out of control.\n\nNow, in our Fourier problem, for our approximation trick to work, the leftover terms — those tiny contributions from far-away frequencies — must shrink faster than one divided by the position number. That means the function must be smooth enough so that its spectrum decays quickly.\n\nIn fact, for most practical functions, after some pre-processing and smoothing, the decay is even faster — often like one divided by the position number squared. And in that case, adding up all the small contributions still gives you a small total. This is what allows our approach to work.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
