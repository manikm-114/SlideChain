Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s talk again about PET-CT, which we’ve mentioned several times. First, the CT image provides structural and anatomical information at a high spatial resolution. It shows the fine details and allows us to see different tissues clearly. On the PET image, you see the distribution of the radiotracer, and in this case, there is a lot of accumulation in one organ. This means the vasculature there is rich, actively taking in nutrients and glucose, which is a sign of rapid tumor growth. The radiotracer—often a form of glucose—is picked up as the tumor cells consume more nutrients than normal tissues. All these radiotracer molecules gather in regions of heightened metabolism, typically where tumors are present.\n\nWhen you superimpose the PET image over the CT image, you get excellent anatomical context. CT provides what's called the linear attenuation coefficient, and this is used to correct for tissue attenuation in PET. If you use only a uniform attenuation correction, the lungs—which actually have very low tissue density—can be misrepresented. Uniform correction assumes the same background for all regions, so in the lung, this leads to overestimation. In reality, the lungs attenuate the PET signal much less. If you apply uniform correction, you falsely report higher activity in the lungs than is accurate, simply because the tissue is less dense.\nCT solves this by providing individualized, tomographic detail for each region. The CT number for the lung is low, and when mapped to attenuation at 511 keV—the PET photon energy—you get a precise, much lower correction for lung tissue. This ensures the activity measurements from PET-CT are more accurate.\n\nLooking at the slide, you see areas where the tumor is intensely bright due to high tracer uptake—these signals are not good news because they reflect significant tumor activity. But after treatment, a follow-up PET-CT scan can show decreased brightness, meaning reduced metabolic activity and, therefore, an effective response to treatment.\nFinally, while CT is very good for showing anatomical detail, such as bone and tissue interfaces, it is not sensitive to soft tissue contrast. CT excels at showing dense structures, like bone, but metabolic changes and soft tissue differences are much better visualized by PET. The combination of PET and CT gives you both anatomical layout and functional information, making it a powerful tool in medical imaging.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
