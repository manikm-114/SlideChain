Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nWhy does a logo look like this? The reason is clear: the meeting covers the full spectrum of CT, SPECT, and PET reconstructions. The logo visually represents these modalities together. For CT, you see the cone-beam geometry at the top, which is standard in modern CT scanning. \n\nFor SPECT, there’s a model with a collimator, a layer of crystals, and photomultiplier tubes—these components are essential for forming SPECT images. At the base is the PET detector ring, which is fundamental for PET. By including these technical elements, the logo symbolizes the integration of all three imaging modalities, reflecting the focus and breadth of the Fully 3D meeting.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
