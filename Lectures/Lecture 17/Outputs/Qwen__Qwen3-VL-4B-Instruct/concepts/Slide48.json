From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAnyway, so this is just for your information. The slide summarizes key concepts for SPECT and PET imaging: statistical distributions, how data is modeled with single and paired emissions, various reconstruction methods including attenuation compensation, deterministic, and statistical reconstruction, as well as the architecture of SPECT and PET scanners and scatter correction. \n\nFinally, it mentions the fully 3D approaches and highlights the importance of the conference and community in advancing this field.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Reject filler or administrative text.\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\n      \"term\": \"statistical distributions\",\n      \"category\": \"mathematics\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"data modeling\",\n      \"category\": \"data_processing\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"single emission\",\n      \"category\": \"data_processing\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"paired emission\",\n      \"category\": \"data_processing\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"reconstruction methods\",\n      \"category\": \"reconstruction\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"attenuation compensation\",\n      \"category\": \"reconstruction\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"deterministic reconstruction\",\n      \"category\": \"reconstruction\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"statistical reconstruction\",\n      \"category\": \"reconstruction\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"spectrum & pet scanners\",\n      \"category\": \"instrumentation\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"architectures\",\n      \"category\": \"instrumentation\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"scatter correction\",\n      \"category\": \"reconstruction\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"fully3d\",\n      \"category\": \"algorithm\"",
