From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAnd by nominal formula, basically, you have a series of events. And for an easy event, it's a probability stake. And say you're a toaster coin, and it's a certain probability P, and you see one result. And the other possibility will be Q. Q equals 1 minus P.\n\nSo you keep doing multiple experiments. And you know how many times you see high, how many times you see tails, this is a good model. And like the example shown here, if you purchase 10 computers. And individually, you know the defective rate is 2%. If you buy 10 computers in a row, what's the chance you get to buy the computer, then you can use by nominal formula. Basically, something like a toast coin. And the probability for you to see one side may not be exactly half. And in general, you can call it P and Q, Q equal to 1 minus P. And the personal distribution is derived from this binomial distribution. One, the number n is very big.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
