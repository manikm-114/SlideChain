From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow we’re talking about the mathematical model for image reconstruction—the core idea is how to represent our data. For PET reconstruction, we usually assume that the number of detected photons is large, so the probability averages out and the measurements closely reflect the mean values. \n\nThat lets us use a deterministic model for reconstruction. For a given line path or line of response, the measured data will primarily reflect the radiotracer concentration along that line, so we can treat the whole reconstruction process as solving for concentrations along known paths.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
