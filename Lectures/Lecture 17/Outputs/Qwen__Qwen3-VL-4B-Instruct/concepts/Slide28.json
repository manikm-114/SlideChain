From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s move into the fourth part, where we discuss system architecture and scatter correction in SPECT and PET imaging. \n\nThis topic is pretty straightforward. We focus on how these imaging systems are built and the basic principles behind scatter correction, which is a major technical consideration for accurate image reconstruction.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
