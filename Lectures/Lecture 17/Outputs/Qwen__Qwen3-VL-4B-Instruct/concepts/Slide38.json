From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHow can you estimate the scattered background? This is actually simple. You set the energy window around the main photopeak. That's the main window right at the peak, and you collect counts there. Then, you also set windows on the left and right—these are the low and high-energy side windows. The idea is that you know the primary gamma photon should be at 511 keV, so its energy falls in the main window.\n\nIf there are scattered photons, their energy will be lower than 511 keV, so you’ll see them in the lower energy window. If there are random events or noise, these could appear in the higher energy window. By collecting data in both the lower and higher side windows, you have a way to estimate the background scattering.\nYou then assign weights to the counts in the lower and higher windows—this weighted combination gives you an estimate of the scattered background in the main window. With that estimate, you subtract the scattered contribution from the main window, giving you the corrected signal. This process lets you measure and remove the scatter components, so your final image is much cleaner and more accurate.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
