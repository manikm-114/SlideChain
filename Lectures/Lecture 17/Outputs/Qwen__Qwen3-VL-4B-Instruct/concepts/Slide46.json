From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nWhen you perform whole-body PET and also whole-body CT, you need to consider the practical challenges and differences. Whole-body CT uses a significant amount of radiation, since it scans the entire patient with X-rays. In contrast, with whole-body PET, as shown in the figure, there is no space to easily position the X-ray components completely around the patient in the same way as traditional CT.\n\nHowever, researchers are actively thinking about creative solutions, and we actually encourage students to work on the possibility of achieving full-body CT simultaneously with PET, even when scanners are large enough to scan the whole body at once. This might require using new, out-of-the-box ideas—possibly even involving MRI technology—instead of conventional techniques. These are exciting areas for innovation and research, and we can discuss some of those cutting-edge possibilities later on in the course.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
