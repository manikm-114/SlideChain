From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s look at PET-MRI. MRI provides excellent soft tissue contrast, which is clear here—structures within the organs are visible in great detail. However, MRI is not ideal for imaging bone structures, and some areas, like those in the lungs, can be less distinct compared to CT. We'll be diving deeper into MRI starting from the next lecture, and I’ve already prepared a recorded session because there may be time constraints. I encourage you all to preview the MRI material; it’s a different modality altogether. MRI takes longer to acquire data, and its spatial resolution depends on the specific imaging agent and scan parameters, especially for maximum coverage of larger anatomical areas.\n\nBy combining PET with MRI—as shown here—you get unique diagnostic information. PET provides molecular and metabolic data, while MRI supplies detailed anatomical views, especially for the brain and soft tissue tumors. This fusion enables more precise diagnosis and assessment of diseases like cancer and neurological disorders. For brain imaging and soft tissue tumors, PET-MRI truly offers cutting-edge capability, making it a highly valuable technology in modern medical imaging.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
