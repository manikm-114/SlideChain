From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThe technical advancement in PET imaging has been driven largely by improvements in detector technology. Over the years, we’ve seen a progression from NaI detectors to BGO, and now to LSO, with each milestone year bringing significant gains in image quality. \n\nThese different generations of detectors reflect long-term innovation in materials, engineering, and system design. As you can see, each new detector technology has resulted in clearer, higher-resolution images. This slide is just for your information; I won’t spend too much time on it, but it’s important to recognize how advancements in detector design have directly impacted the quality of PET images throughout the history of the field.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
