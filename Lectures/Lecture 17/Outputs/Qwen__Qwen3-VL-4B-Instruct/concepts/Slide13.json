From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s look closer—if you have only one radiotracer concentration at a single source, it’s pretty simple. But when you have two sources, or more specifically, two gamma resources, things get complicated. If you try to multiply the measurements, like I showed on the previous slide, you end up expanding two terms from each measurement. That gives you four terms in total.\n\nThe first two terms are nice—they give you a constant weighting factor, and the line integral of the concentrations squared. That part would make things look easy, as long as the weighting factor stays constant. But the problem is, you also get cross-product terms when expanding. These cross terms involve measurements from one source to the detector, multiplied by measurements from the second source to the other detector, so you get combinations like from d1 to a and from d2 to b, where a and b are different source positions.\n\nThese cross terms are messy and make modeling in SPECT much more complicated. The cross terms mean the data model for SPECT includes weighting factors that still depend on the source positions, even when you know the attenuation background. This partial attenuation messes up the tidy modeling you get with paired photon events in PET; for PET or paired emission, the modeling is straightforward, and you get constant weighting. That’s why, for SPECT, you can’t just ignore these source-position-dependent factors—they’re built into the math and must be dealt with when reconstructing images.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
