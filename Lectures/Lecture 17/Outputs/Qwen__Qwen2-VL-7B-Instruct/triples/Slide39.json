Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo this shows you the result. This is the real measurement, and you can see the scattered background as it appears in the data. When you remove the scattered background, you get these corrected measurements, or corrected reconstructions. \n\nThis demonstrates how the result changes by addressing the scattering problem. Scatter correction is a key point in improving measurement accuracy and image quality.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"scatter correction\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"measurement accuracy and image quality\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"scatter correction is a key point in improving measurement accuracy and image quality\"}\n  ]\n}",
