Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let's talk about the desirable properties of crystal materials used in PET scanners. I'll go through these quickly. First, the crystal should have a high density, which gives it a large effective cross-section for interacting with gamma rays. Next, you want a large effective atomic number—this increases gamma-ray detection efficiency by boosting photoelectric absorption. The decay time should be short; you need the crystal to release its light energy very quickly. If the decay time is too long, then each photon event can overlap in time, causing loss in timing resolution and poor image quality.\n\nA high light yield is also important—the crystal must convert as much gamma energy as possible into visible light, maximizing signal for efficient detection. Ideally, the wavelength of the emitted light should be near 400 nanometers, since photomultiplier tubes are most sensitive in this range, making the system more efficient. Additionally, the refractive index should be close to 1.5 to ensure optimal optical coupling between the crystal and the photomultiplier tube.\nThe crystal must also be non-hygroscopic, meaning it should not absorb moisture from the air. If it does, it can degrade and turn into powder, which would make it unusable for detector fabrication. All these properties are critical for reliable, high-performance medical imaging with PET scanners.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
