Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet me explain attenuation correction and why it’s so important for PET-CT imaging. When you want to measure the attenuation coefficient, or mu, for PET, you often use an individual CT scan to map out the mu distribution inside the patient’s body.\n\nBut here’s a key point: the photon energy in PET is much different from CT. PET uses gamma photons at 511 keV, while X-ray CT scans use tube voltages that go up to about 140 kVp. The actual X-ray beam covers a spectrum from around 30 keV to 140 keV, but all these energies can be summed up as a single effective energy, usually around 70 keV. So, when you measure attenuation with CT, the coefficient you get is really for that effective energy, about 70 keV.\n\nFor PET attenuation correction, you need the mu value at 511 keV, because those more energetic gamma photons interact differently with tissue. To bridge this gap, you use a piecewise linear mapping. That means for any CT-measured attenuation coefficient at 70 keV, you estimate the corresponding coefficient for PET at 511 keV. This mapping follows a pretty reliable, piecewise linear relationship: tissues that have low attenuation at CT energies also have low attenuation at PET energies, and vice versa.\n\nWhy do we combine PET and CT? The CT scan provides anatomical structure, while the PET scan gives functional information. Having both types of data in a single framework is powerful—you get two kinds of complementary information. But beyond that, CT also provides the key information needed for attenuation correction in PET. With the mu values from CT, you can calculate the scaling factor, making it possible to convert PET data into proper line integrals for accurate image reconstruction.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
