Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s move into the fourth part, where we discuss system architecture and scatter correction in SPECT and PET imaging. \n\nThis topic is pretty straightforward. We focus on how these imaging systems are built and the basic principles behind scatter correction, which is a major technical consideration for accurate image reconstruction.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
