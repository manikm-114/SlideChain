From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThe goal is to make your line integral data accurately reflect the true line integrals through the body. This allows you to reconstruct images that truly represent the concentration of radiotracer in the organ of interest. You can do this for each organ and at each time point during the PET imaging session. By plotting these time curves, you can assess perfusion in different regions and extract physiologically relevant parameters. \n\nThis process gives you more diagnostic information and helps to interpret the results accurately. These steps—attenuation correction, scatter and random correction, and dead time correction—are all essential for quantitative PET imaging. They work together to ensure that your final images and time-activity curves are both accurate and clinically meaningful, which is the central principle behind quantitative PET analysis.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
