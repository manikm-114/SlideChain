From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nWhen we talk about PET or paired photon emission models, the weighting factor for attenuation is constant along a given line of response. That means when you do an integral over all source distributions, you can pull this constant weighting factor outside the integral—it doesn't depend on the source position. \n\nYou’ll see how this works more clearly in the next slide. So, let’s shift our focus to image reconstruction, where these ideas become important.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Reject filler or administrative text.\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"paired photon emission models\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"weighting factor for attenuation\", \"category\": \"physics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"integral over all source distributions\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"constant weighting factor\", \"category\": \"physics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"image reconstruction\", \"category\": \"reconstruction\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"When we talk about PET or paired photon emission models, the weighting factor for attenuation is constant along a given line of response.
