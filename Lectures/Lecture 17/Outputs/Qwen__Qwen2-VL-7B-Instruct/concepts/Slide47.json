From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAnother point I want to highlight, as indicated by the green button here, involves using multiple pinholes with a scintillation camera. Traditionally, you would use a single pinhole to capture one image at a time. But in this pioneering work, as shown in the paper, they introduced the concept of using several pinholes—seven in this case. Each pinhole forms a distinct image, producing multiple views of the target simultaneously; for example, you get a double-cone image from one pinhole’s geometry, and with seven pinholes, you get seven images at once.\n\nThis approach was used to image the heart, allowing for seven simultaneous views, which improved accuracy by acquiring several perspectives at a single time point. Although the reconstructions from those seven views weren’t fully impressive with the technology available back then, the idea remains promising. There is real potential: if you collect seven views from one direction and another seven from an orthogonal direction, then with modern signal processing, you may achieve image reconstructions far superior to those early results. This opens up interesting possibilities for future multi-view tomography and advanced image reconstruction techniques.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
