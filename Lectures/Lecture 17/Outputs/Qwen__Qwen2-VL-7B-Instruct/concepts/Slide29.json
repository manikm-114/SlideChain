From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nOn this slide, you see a great picture of a SPECT scanner. The SPECT camera system is held together by a sturdy structure, and it’s designed to rotate around the patient. This rotation allows the scanner to collect data from multiple orientations, which is conceptually similar to how CT scanners work. \n\nBy rotating the detector and collimators around the patient, we get signals from different angles, enabling a full three-dimensional reconstruction. The system also allows for standard longitudinal scanning, which is what you typically see in practical clinical use.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
