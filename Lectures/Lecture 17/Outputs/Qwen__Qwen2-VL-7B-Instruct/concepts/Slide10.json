From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet me just sum up: this is a statistical model, called the Poisson model, and you should know a little bit about it, because it also applies to X-ray emission. When you hit tungsten with an electron beam, you get a certain number of X-ray photons coming out, and that X-ray emission also follows the Poisson distribution.\n\nWhen you detect X-ray photons, sometimes you use photon-counting detectors, which are the latest technology. But most common X-ray detectors are still current-based or energy-integrating types. In traditional X-ray detection, besides Poisson noise, you also get electronic noise from the semiconductor detector design. That electronic noise is modeled by the Gaussian distribution.\n\nSo for X-ray CT data acquisition, the full statistical model is actually a combination—Poisson noise plus Gaussian noise. This is just a side note to help you see the big picture. Now, let’s look at data models for single photon emission and paired photon emission, and how these statistical concepts fit in.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
