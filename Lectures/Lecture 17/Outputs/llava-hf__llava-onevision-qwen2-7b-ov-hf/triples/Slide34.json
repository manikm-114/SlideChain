Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAll of these are considered desirable properties for PET detector crystals. The table lists the main candidate materials used in PET scanners. You don't need to memorize all the details or specific values here—in clinical practice, it’s more important to understand the general differences and why a particular material might be chosen for a given system. \n\nWhat matters is knowing that these materials differ in their density, decay time, emission intensity, atomic number, refractive index, and whether they are hygroscopic. Each property affects how well the crystal works for detecting gamma rays and producing high-quality PET images.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1].
