Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThe technical advancement in PET imaging has been driven largely by improvements in detector technology. Over the years, we’ve seen a progression from NaI detectors to BGO, and now to LSO, with each milestone year bringing significant gains in image quality. \n\nThese different generations of detectors reflect long-term innovation in materials, engineering, and system design. As you can see, each new detector technology has resulted in clearer, higher-resolution images. This slide is just for your information; I won’t spend too much time on it, but it’s important to recognize how advancements in detector design have directly impacted the quality of PET images throughout the history of the field.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"PET imaging\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"NaI detectors\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"The technical advancement in PET imaging has been driven largely by improvements in detector technology.
