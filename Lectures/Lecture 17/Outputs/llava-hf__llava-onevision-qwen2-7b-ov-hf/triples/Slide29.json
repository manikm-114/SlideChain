Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nOn this slide, you see a great picture of a SPECT scanner. The SPECT camera system is held together by a sturdy structure, and it’s designed to rotate around the patient. This rotation allows the scanner to collect data from multiple orientations, which is conceptually similar to how CT scanners work. \n\nBy rotating the detector and collimators around the patient, we get signals from different angles, enabling a full three-dimensional reconstruction. The system also allows for standard longitudinal scanning, which is what you typically see in practical clinical use.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"SPECT scanner\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"patient\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"The SPECT camera system is held together by a sturdy structure, and it’s designed to rotate around the patient.
