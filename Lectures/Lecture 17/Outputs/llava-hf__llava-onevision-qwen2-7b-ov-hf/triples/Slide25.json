Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThis example shows patient reconstruction results. When using filtered back projection, the images clearly display streak artifacts and significant noise. These issues appear across all views—coronal, transaxial, and sagittal. Overall, the images produced by filtered back projection are noisy and contain strong artifacts that reduce clarity and diagnostic value.\n\nIn contrast, maximum likelihood iterative reconstruction directly incorporates statistical knowledge into the reconstruction process. This approach produces images that are both visually and quantitatively improved. Noise is greatly reduced, artifacts are minimized, and the resulting images are more accurate and reliable for clinical use.\nThe side-by-side comparison highlights the advantage of maximum likelihood iterative reconstruction over traditional filtered back projection. In real patient data, the iterative approach delivers superior image quality, both in appearance and in diagnostic accuracy.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"filtered back projection\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"streak artifacts and significant noise\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"The images clearly display streak artifacts and significant noise.\"}\n  ]\n}",
