  "raw_output": "user \nSystem:\nYou are extracting factual relations from a medical imaging lecture. Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nVisually, you see that 3D PET systems have a clear benefit because they don’t use mechanical collimators. With no collimators blocking the gamma rays, you can capture a much greater number of photons, which raises the system’s sensitivity and improves image quality. The drawback is that, because the system has a wide opening, it can also pick up more scattered and random events. These unwanted signals can interfere with the data and reduce the quality of your images. \n\nLater, we’ll cover what scattered and random events actually are, and how we try to remove them in post-processing. For 2D PET imaging, where you have strict collimation, only photons from a certain plane are detected, and scattered photons from other directions are blocked. But in 3D PET, you let in more data, and while that's a benefit for sensitivity, it can also make noise and unwanted signals more of a problem.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"3D PET systems\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"clear benefit\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"Visually, you see that 3D PET systems have a clear benefit because they don’t use mechanical collimators.\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
