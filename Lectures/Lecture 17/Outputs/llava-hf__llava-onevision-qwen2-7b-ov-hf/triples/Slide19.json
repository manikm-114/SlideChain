Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThere’s a lot of research going on in this area. I should put another green button here for curiosity’s sake—because some of these ideas can be solved analytically when you assume the attenuation coefficient, mu, is constant. You can use Fourier analysis, closed-form solutions, or algebraic approaches, like solving systems of linear equations.\n\nJust to point out, for those who are curious, there’s a paper shown here about using analytic techniques and the Fourier slice theorem for SPECT. These methods are more complicated than CT, but they show that there are options for solving the reconstruction problem with closed-form solutions or advanced mathematics. Next, let’s look at deterministic PET reconstruction.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1].
