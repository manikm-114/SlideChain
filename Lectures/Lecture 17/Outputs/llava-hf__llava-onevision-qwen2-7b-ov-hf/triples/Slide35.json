Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThere aren't many engineering details here, but this is mainly for those working in detector development. The key components for PET detectors start with the scintillation crystals, which are organized into blocks. Each block is coupled with multiple photomultiplier tubes in the background—typically four per block. These blocks are then assembled into a complete detector ring that surrounds the patient. As the PET system operates, the crystals detect incoming gamma photons, and the photomultiplier tubes convert the light produced by these interactions into electrical signals.\n\nThe system’s processing unit precisely monitors the electrical signals to determine exactly when and where events have occurred, and at what energy. The main gamma photon from a PET scan carries 511 keV energy. But if there is multiple scattering, such as Compton scattering inside the body, energy is lost and can complicate the signal. The electronics and coincidence processing unit integrate all detected events, and finally, this data is sent to the computer system.\nAfter data acquisition, image reconstruction begins—often with methods such as filtered back projection—to produce cross-sectional images. All of these steps come together to make PET imaging possible, from crystal blocks and photomultiplier tubes to data integration and final image creation.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
