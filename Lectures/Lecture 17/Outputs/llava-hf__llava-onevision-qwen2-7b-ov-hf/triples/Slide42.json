Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo, graphically, you can see this process clearly. The total counts—the overall measured signal or image—actually contain two main components. These two components are scatter background and random counts, along with a variety of other effects and oddities. You can estimate the random count by using a delayed window, and triple coincidences can be corrected as well. There are many correction methods, but the most important thing to understand from this lecture is to have a rough idea of how these corrections work.\n\nAll these corrections—including attenuation correction, scatter correction, random correction, and corrections for dead time—are essential to refine the measured signal and make sure your results reflect the true activity as accurately as possible.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"scatter background\", \"p\":\"measures\", \"o\":\"total counts\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"The total counts—the overall measured signal or image—actually contain two main components.\"},\n    {\"s\":\"random counts\", \"p\":\"measures\", \"o\":\"total counts\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"The total counts—the overall measured signal or image—actually contain two main components.\"},\n    {\"s\":\"delayed window\", \"p\":\"corrects\", \"o\":\"random count\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"You can estimate the random count by using a delayed window.\"},\n    {\"s\":\"triple coincidences\", \"p\":\"corrects\", \"o\":\"random count\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"triple coincidences can be corrected as well.\"},\n    {\"s\":\"correction methods\", \"p\":\"includes\", \"o\":\"corrections\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"There are many correction methods, but",
