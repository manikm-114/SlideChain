Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThe leading researchers in this field have developed a very large PET detector known as a whole body PET. By making the detector long enough to cover the entire body, the sensitivity is dramatically increased, allowing for even greater sensitivity than conventional PET systems. \n\nWith this approach, you can obtain a much more sensitive and comprehensive view of the entire body in a single scan. This technology offers the opportunity to capture detailed, global images of tracer distribution, potentially improving diagnostic capabilities and expanding what can be studied. It's a very interesting and innovative idea that's advancing the field of molecular imaging.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"whole body PET detector\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"conventional PET systems\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"By making the detector long enough to cover the entire body, the sensitivity is dramatically increased, allowing for even greater sensitivity than conventional PET systems.\"}\n  ]\n}",
