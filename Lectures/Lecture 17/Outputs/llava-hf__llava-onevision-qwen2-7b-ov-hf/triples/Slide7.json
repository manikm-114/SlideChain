Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAnd Poisson noise, Poisson distribution, you would need some high school statistics, you learned permutations and combinations. And this permutation, you just see the different arrangement, roughly speaking, a combination, you need to just remove those, those essentially the same arrangement like ABC and ACB. \n\nIn terms of combination, you think it's the same thing because this is same three individuals are involved in this activity. So you need just the distinction between permutation and combination. So you can review this slide, you will recall what you learned.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"permutation\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"combination\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"In terms of combination, you think it's the same thing because this is same three individuals are involved in this activity.
