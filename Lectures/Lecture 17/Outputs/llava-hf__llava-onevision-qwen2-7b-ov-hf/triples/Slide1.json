Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nWelcome to Lecture 17 on SPECT and PET. Today, we’re finishing the nuclear imaging section. Before I explain the content of this lecture, let’s get started by recalling why these modalities matter in biomedical imaging. SPECT stands for Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography, and PET means Positron Emission Tomography.\n\nBoth enable molecular imaging and are vital for diagnostics, functional evaluation. They use specific tracers and detectors, which we’ll explore in detail today\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"SPECT\", \"p\":\"uses\", \"o\":\"nuclear imaging\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"SPECT stands for Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography, and PET means Positron Emission Tomography.\"}\n  ]\n}",
