Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nWhen we talk about PET or paired photon emission models, the weighting factor for attenuation is constant along a given line of response. That means when you do an integral over all source distributions, you can pull this constant weighting factor outside the integral—it doesn't depend on the source position. \n\nYou’ll see how this works more clearly in the next slide. So, let’s shift our focus to image reconstruction, where these ideas become important.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"pair photon emission models\", \"p\":\"uses\",\n     \"o\":\"integral\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"When we talk about PET or paired photon emission models, the weighting factor for attenuation is constant along a given line of response.
