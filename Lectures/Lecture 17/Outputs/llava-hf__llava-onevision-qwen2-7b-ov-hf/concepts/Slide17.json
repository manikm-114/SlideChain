From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nWhen we talk about PET or paired photon emission models, the weighting factor for attenuation is constant along a given line of response. That means when you do an integral over all source distributions, you can pull this constant weighting factor outside the integral—it doesn't depend on the source position. \n\nYou’ll see how this works more clearly in the next slide. So, let’s shift our focus to image reconstruction, where these ideas become important.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"pairing\", \"category\": \"physics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"weighting factor\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"integral\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"source distributions\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"image reconstruction\", \"category\": \"reconstruction\"},\n    {\"term\": \"constant weighting factor\", \"category\": \"physics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"line of response\", \"category\": \"physics\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"When we talk about PET or paired photon emission models, the weighting factor for attenuation is constant along a given line of response.
