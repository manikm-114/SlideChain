From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThe technical advancement in PET imaging has been driven largely by improvements in detector technology. Over the years, we’ve seen a progression from NaI detectors to BGO, and now to LSO, with each milestone year bringing significant gains in image quality. \n\nThese different generations of detectors reflect long-term innovation in materials, engineering, and system design. As you can see, each new detector technology has resulted in clearer, higher-resolution images. This slide is just for your information; I won’t spend too much time on it, but it’s important to recognize how advancements in detector design have directly impacted the quality of PET images throughout the history of the field.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"PET imaging\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \" detector technology\", \"category\": \"instrumentation\"},\n    {\"term\": \"NaI detectors\", \"category\": \"instrumentation\"},\n    {\"term\": \"BGO\", \"category\": \"instrumentation\"},\n    {\"term\": \"LSO\", \"category\": \"instrumentation\"},\n    {\"term\": \"image quality\", \"category\": \"quality_metric\"},\n    {\"term\": \"clearer, higher-resolution images\", \"category\": \"quality_metric\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"The technical advancement in PET imaging has been driven largely by improvements in detector technology.
