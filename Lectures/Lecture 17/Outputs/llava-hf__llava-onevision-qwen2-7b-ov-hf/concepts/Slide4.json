From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, let’s talk about dead time in nuclear imaging systems. If the efficiency of our system is high, and we inject a large dose of radiopharmaceutical, the number of gamma rays hitting the scintillation crystal can actually be more than the system can handle. This happens because the gamma camera needs some time to recover between events. If two scintillation events happen too close together, they can't both get recorded.\n\nThe total dead time, which we call \"tau,\" is given by this equation: tau equals capital N minus small n, divided by small n times capital N. So, let me say it again: tau equals capital N minus small n, divided by small n times capital N.\n\nHere, \"capital N\" is the true count rate, which means how many scintillations actually happen every second. ”small n\" is the observed count rate, so that’s how many the system actually records. If you take one divided by a small n, you get the average time spent on each counted event. If you take one divided by capital N, that’s what you'd have in an ideal system without any dead time. The difference between these two tells us how much measurement is lost because of dead time.\nOf course, what we want is for dead time—again, \"tau\"—to be zero, so every real event is counted. But in reality, as count rates go up, the number of missed events goes up too.\n\nAlways try to use simple ideas to help you understand, and don’t get lost in complicated formulas. For example, if a student brings me a huge program and says the results are wrong, I tell them, break it into small pieces—each piece with clear inputs and outputs. Debug those parts one by one. This makes understanding the whole problem much easier and helps you find mistakes faster.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
