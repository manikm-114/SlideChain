From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nWhen we use a ring detector in PET, the key is to perform coincidence detection. This means we’re looking for events where two detectors on opposite sides register gamma photons at the same time—those photons come from an annihilation happening somewhere inside the ring. You can determine a line integral along the green line shown here, or along the blue line for different angles. By rotating the ring or changing the projection angle, you can collect projections from multiple directions. \n\nWhen you arrange all these projections by angle, you get what’s called a sinogram, very similar to what you see in CT. As long as you know the attenuation and apply the correct compensation factors, you can accumulate your data into these line integrals. That’s the essential idea behind PET and SPECT data acquisition—grouping your measurements along lines of response and sorting them by angle into a sinogram.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
