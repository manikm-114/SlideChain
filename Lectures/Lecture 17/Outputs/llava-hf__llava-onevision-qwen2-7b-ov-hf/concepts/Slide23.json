From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nWe begin with the idea that each gamma ray measurement is modeled independently. The underlying framework is a plasma model. Consider an image made up of pixels. Each pixel, along with its neighbors, contributes independently—meaning the measurement at one pixel does not directly depend on another. To capture this mathematically, we partition time into small intervals—for example, 10 milliseconds each. One interval, the next interval, and another further away all behave independently. This independence is crucial because it allows us to express the probability of the entire measurement as the product of many small probabilities. Each detector, each pixel, each time interval contributes its own probability, and multiplying them together gives the overall likelihood.\n\nThis setup naturally leads to probabilistic modeling. Bayes’ rule, which many of us first learned in high school, becomes central here. Imagine a patient comes in, and we perform data acquisition using a camera or a PET scanner. The raw measurements are then organized into sinograms in 2D or 3D. To understand error and uncertainty, we rely on the power of mathematical notation, which is both compact and expressive. In fact, the measured counts can be modeled as random variables following a Poisson distribution. The problem can then be phrased as: given the measured data, what is the most likely underlying image, denoted by capital lambda (Λ)?\nThis probability depends on several factors. First, assume the true image is known, along with the source distribution and any background activity. If we also know the imaging geometry, then we can predict what each detector should record. For example, a detector may be expected to receive around 3,000 gamma photons during a five-minute scan. The difficulty is that in reality, the image is not known—we only have the measured data. That’s why we must also consider prior knowledge about the image distribution. For younger patients without cancer, we may expect little to no radioactive uptake in major organs. For older patients, there may be a higher probability of uptake, for instance, in the colon if there is a tumor. These expectations form a prior distribution on the image.\n\nHowever, in many cases, especially when data is scarce, we may not want to assume anything specific. In that case, we take the prior distribution to be uniform, meaning every image is equally likely. This constant prior does not affect the statistical estimation, since it cancels out in maximization.\nFrom here, two key concepts arise: maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation and maximum likelihood (ML) estimation. MAP seeks the image that maximizes the posterior probability, combining both the likelihood of the measured data given the image and the prior probability of the image itself. If we assume the prior is uniform, MAP reduces to maximum likelihood estimation. In ML, we search for the image that makes the measured data most probable.\n\nThe process is iterative: we try candidate images, compute the probability that they would have produced the measured data, and adjust until we find one with the highest probability. That image is then reported as our reconstruction. In summary, if the prior distribution is non-informative, MAP and ML give the same result. Otherwise, MAP incorporates prior knowledge to guide the estimation.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
