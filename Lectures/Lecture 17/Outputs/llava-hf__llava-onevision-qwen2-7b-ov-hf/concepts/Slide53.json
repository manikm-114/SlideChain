  "raw_output": "user \nSystem:\nYou are an expert educator in medical imaging. From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nWhy does a logo look like this? The reason is clear: the meeting covers the full spectrum of CT, SPECT, and PET reconstructions. The logo visually represents these modalities together. For CT, you see the cone-beam geometry at the top, which is standard in modern CT scanning. \n\nFor SPECT, there’s a model with a collimator, a layer of crystals, and photomultiplier tubes—these components are essential for forming SPECT images. At the base is the PET detector ring, which is fundamental for PET. By including these technical elements, the logo symbolizes the integration of all three imaging modalities, reflecting the focus and breadth of the Fully 3D meeting.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"cone-beam geometry\", \"category\": \"reconstruction\"},\n    {\"term\": \"collimator\", \"category\": \"instrumentation\"},\n    {\"term\": \"crystals\", \"category\": \"instrumentation\"},\n    {\"term\": \"photomultiplier tubes\", \"category\": \"instrumentation\"},\n    {\"term\": \"PET detector ring\", \"category\": \"instrumentation\"},\n    {\"term\": \"CT scanning\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"SPECT imaging\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"PET\", \"category\": \"modality\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"The logo visually represents these modalities together.\", \"For CT, you see the cone-beam geometry at the top, which is standard in modern CT scanning.\"]\n}\n```",
