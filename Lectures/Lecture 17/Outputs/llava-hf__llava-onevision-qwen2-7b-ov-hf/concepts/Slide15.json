From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nEarlier PET scanners used planar imaging mode, which meant you had mechanical collimators defining the imaging planes. These collimators would shape the radioactivity that could reach the detectors, so the ring only collected signals from a thin slice, or plane, of the patient. The detectors were arranged in rings around the patient, and you’d have different parts of the ring recording data for the left and right sides. \n\nModern PET scanners, though, have removed these mechanical collimators. Instead, you use coincidence detection in three dimensions. This 3D orientation means you can detect gamma photons from many directions, and you’re not limited by a physical collimator—anywhere in the field of view, you can pick up valid annihilation events.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
