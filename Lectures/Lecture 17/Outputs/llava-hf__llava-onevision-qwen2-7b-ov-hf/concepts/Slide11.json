From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s look at this slide—you see a diamond symbol, so pay attention. For nuclear emission, the energy of gamma-ray photons is usually in the range of about 60 to 600 keV, and most importantly, about ninety percent of applications use the isotope technetium-99m. This isotope, Tc-99m, has an energy of 140 keV. Now, keep that number in mind—sometimes I forget, but it’s 140 keV, just a little higher than the energy used for X-rays. X-ray energy is usually between 80 keV and up to around 130 keV, so this radiotracer energy is actually quite comparable to the X-ray photon energy range. Now, for positron emission, you’ll notice in the homework there's a question about the gamma-ray energy produced by positron emission. The answer is 511 keV, which is much higher.\n\nFor single photon emission, here’s how we model it. Let’s say the source is at position \"a.\" At location \"a\" in the body, you have a certain amount of radiotracer—a concentration or count of radioactive atoms—denoted as N(a). You collimate the gamma-ray flux at this spot, and you look down that line to see how much signal flows toward the detector. Now, the gamma-ray can be emitted in any direction, so a scaling factor is applied, proportional to the size of that mechanical collimator. At the detector, you measure how many gamma-ray photons you can receive.\n\nIf the gamma-ray source were in a vacuum, you’d get just your initial concentration, scaled by the geometric factor—that’s determined by how big the collimator opening is. In reality, the radiotracer is inside the human body, so the photons move from \"a\" toward the gamma camera detector at position \"d.\" Along the way, the photons encounter tissue and undergo attenuation. For gamma-ray photons at 140 keV, their energy is just above the high end used for CT x-rays, but the physics is similar—they’re tiny waves.\nThe formula you see uses an exponential factor, e to the negative integral from \"a\" to \"d\" of mu(s) ds. Here, mu is the attenuation coefficient, which depends on position in the body. This exponential term describes how the signal from the source gets weighted by attenuation—it's a line integral, but not a full line like in CT, more of a partial line integral. This is what makes SPECT reconstruction different from X-ray CT reconstruction—so this data model is straightforward but very important.\n\nNow, let’s look at paired photon emission. Here, an event occurs: a positron is emitted, finds a nearby electron, and annihilates. That results in two gamma-ray photons flying off in opposite directions. One gamma-ray photon travels from position \"a\" to detector d1, the other goes from \"a\" to detector d2. Both photons are attenuated along their paths. The attenuation factor for each path acts like a probability—the chance that the photon actually reaches the detector.\nFor a paired event to be registered, both photons have to hit their detectors at the same time—so the total probability is the product of two individual probabilities. Both exponential attenuation factors multiply together, so in the exponent, you just add up the two integrals—from d1 to a, and from a to d2. Together, these cover the entire path from d1 to d2, resulting in a traditional line integral. And the nice thing is, this line integral does not depend on the original source position \"a\"—it's only about the line between d1 and d2.\n\nSo, you have two models here: one where the weighting depends on the source location, and one where the weighting—the response along the line—remains constant, regardless of where the gamma source is. For paired photon events, the formula has constant weight; for single photon events, the weight changes based on where the radiotracer is located. And if the radiotracer moves, the weighting factor changes with it. Any questions?\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
