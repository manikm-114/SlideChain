From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAnyway, so this is just for your information. The slide summarizes key concepts for SPECT and PET imaging: statistical distributions, how data is modeled with single and paired emissions, various reconstruction methods including attenuation compensation, deterministic, and statistical reconstruction, as well as the architecture of SPECT and PET scanners and scatter correction. \n\nFinally, it mentions the fully 3D approaches and highlights the importance of the conference and community in advancing this field.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"statistical distributions\", \"category\": \"statistics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"single and paired emissions\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"reconstruction methods\", \"category\": \"reconstruction\"},\n    {\"term\": \"attenuation compensation\", \"category\": \"physics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"deterministic and statistical reconstruction\", \"category\": \"algorithm\"},\n    {\"term\": \"architecture of SPECT and PET scanners\", \"category\": \"instrumentation\"},\n    {\"term\": \"scatter correction\", \"category\": \"data_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"fully 3D approaches\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"conference and community\", \"category\": \"communication\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"The slide summarizes key concepts for SPECT and PET imaging: statistical distributions, how data is modeled with single and paired emissions, various reconstruction methods including attenuation compensation, deterministic, and statistical reconstruction, as well as the architecture of SPECT and PET scanners and scatter correction.
