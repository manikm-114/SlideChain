From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo this shows you the result. This is the real measurement, and you can see the scattered background as it appears in the data. When you remove the scattered background, you get these corrected measurements, or corrected reconstructions. \n\nThis demonstrates how the result changes by addressing the scattering problem. Scatter correction is a key point in improving measurement accuracy and image quality.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"scatter correction\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"measurement accuracy\", \"category\": \"quality_metric\"},\n    {\"term\": \"image quality\", \"category\": \"quality_metric\"},\n    {\"term\": \"corrected measurements\", \"category\": \"reconstruction\"},\n    {\"term\": \"corrected reconstructions\", \"category\": \"reconstruction\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"This demonstrates how the result changes by addressing the scattering problem.\", \"Scatter correction is a key point in improving measurement accuracy and image quality.\"]\n}\n```",
