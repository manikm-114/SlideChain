From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nWelcome to Lecture 17 on SPECT and PET. Today, we’re finishing the nuclear imaging section. Before I explain the content of this lecture, let’s get started by recalling why these modalities matter in biomedical imaging. SPECT stands for Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography, and PET means Positron Emission Tomography.\n\nBoth enable molecular imaging and are vital for diagnostics, functional evaluation. They use specific tracers and detectors, which we’ll explore in detail today\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"SPECT\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"PET\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"nuclear imaging\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"tracers\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"detectors\", \"category\": \"instrumentation\"},\n    {\"term\": \"molecular imaging\", \"category\": \"anatomy\"},\n    {\"term\": \"diagnostics\", \"category\": \"workflow\"},\n    {\"term\": \"functional evaluation\", \"category\": \"workflow\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"SPECT stands for Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography, and PET means Positron Emission Tomography.\", \"Both enable molecular imaging and are vital for diagnostics, functional evaluation.\"]\n}\n```",
