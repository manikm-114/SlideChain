From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo this is the website for the Fully3D 2017 meeting, which was held in Xi’an, China from June 18 to 23, 2017. If you are interested, you can take a look for more information about the conference, its location, and the history of Xi’an as China’s oldest ancient capital and the starting point of the Silk Road. It’s also home to the famous Terracotta Army, known as the eighth wonder of the world.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"Xi'an\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"Terracotta Army\", \"category\": \"anatomy\"},\n    {\"term\": \"China’s oldest ancient capital\", \"category\": \"anatomy\"},\n    {\"term\": \"starting point of the Silk Road\", \"category\": \"anatomy\"},\n    {\"term\": \"conference\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"meeting\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"Xi’an, China\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"June 18 to 23, 2017\", \"category\": \"workflow\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"So this is the website for the Fully3D 2017 meeting, which was held in Xi’an, China from June 18 to 23, 2017.\", \"It’s also home to the famous Terracotta Army, known as the eighth wonder of the world.\"]\n}\n```",
