Now, building on the idea used in PET-CT, we can talk about SPECT-CT systems. In this setup, there can be two or even three SPECT cameras working at the same time to gather more data. If you use only one planar gamma detector, a lot of photons—especially those coming horizontally and downward—will be wasted, and their information won’t be captured. 

But with triple detectors, you can use gamma photons much more efficiently. The CT part of the system gives you precise anatomical information and helps provide accurate attenuation correction for the SPECT data. This means better quantification, improved image quality, and superior diagnostic capability through combined anatomical and functional information.
