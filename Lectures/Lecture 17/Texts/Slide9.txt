Let’s go through the math a bit. I put a green button on this slide to help you remember the key idea: to understand Poisson and Gaussian noise, you need a good grip on the binomial formula, but also on permutations and combinations. When you have a large number of events, you can use some analytic steps to show that the distribution will approach the Poisson form.

For example, in gamma-ray emission—whether it’s single gamma-ray emission or paired photons—the process follows the Poisson distribution model, which uses the parameter lambda. So what does this mean in practice? Let’s say you’re counting gamma-ray photons during a scan. The whole time period gets cut into many small intervals. In each tiny interval, the probability that you get a photon is small, call that P, and the probability that you don’t is Q, which is just one minus P. Whether you get a photon or not in any interval is random; there’s no way to predict it exactly.

This randomness is at the heart of nuclear physics. The emission is not deterministic—it just follows probabilities. Einstein famously said, “God does not play dice,” but some would argue that God indeed lets randomness play a role in the universe. In our context, the emission of gamma-ray photons is governed by pure chance, following the Poisson distribution. When you zoom in to those tiny intervals, you’re really dealing with just the possibility—P or Q—of a gamma-ray being emitted, and it’s entirely a game of probability.
