Let’s try to keep a simple, heuristic picture in your mind. Having a clear mental image is key to understanding any concept well. Now, let’s talk about our outline and what we’ll cover today. We’ll go through single-photon imaging, computed tomography, and positron emission imaging. These are the two main nuclear imaging modalities for tomographic reconstruction.

So, with single photon imaging, we deal with gamma rays coming from the patient, and with positron emission, we’re focused on positrons. The positron doesn’t stay around for long—it quickly finds a nearby electron. When a positron meets an electron, we use a big word called annihilation, and together they create a pair of gamma-ray photons that shoot out in opposite directions at the speed of light.

So you have two kinds of imaging. With single photon emission computed tomography, or SPECT, we use single photons—pretty obvious from the name. And with positron emission tomography, or PET, it’s actually two photons created from one positron and one electron. Both types of imaging are deeply governed by statistics.
As background, I really want us to review statistical distributions. This part will be brief—just a rapid overview. If you want to dig into details, you can do that later. After the statistics part, we’ll talk about data models. For either single-photon or positron imaging, you need a mathematical model for how you collect data. Last time, I explained the physical concepts and chemical mechanisms, and we talked about collimation. But with formulas, you can actually write computer programs to do image reconstruction based on these models.

So the data modeling part is about writing down the equations. Given a distribution, what measurements do you expect to see? Once you have a forward model, you want to invert the process. That lets you recover the underlying distribution—the actual tomographic images. Now, these images aren’t anatomical details or structures, but they show the distribution of radioactive features that you introduced into the patient.
To do this, we need to compensate for attenuation, and we have two options: deterministic and statistical reconstruction. We’ll talk about those later. Then, finally, I’ll discuss the scanner architecture. You know, in a CT scanner, you have X-ray tubes, X-ray detectors, high voltage, a transformer, a cooling system, a slip ring, and so on—all packed inside the gantry. A nuclear scanner might look similar on the outside, but inside, it’s quite different, and I’ll explain how.

I’ll also mention correction methods, especially scatter correction and how we deal with random counts—how we detect them and remove them. These corrections are much different from how CT works. Finally, I’ll mention a bit about the Fully3D conference, which focuses on advanced topics in medical imaging reconstruction, with an emphasis on X-ray CT and related techniques. We’re organizing that meeting, and it’s a good chance to learn more. If time permits, I’ll show you today’s homework questions and give comments. That’s pretty much the plan—just to give you the big picture, so you can see where each part fits in.
