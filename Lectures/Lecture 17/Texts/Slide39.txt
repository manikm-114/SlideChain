So this shows you the result. This is the real measurement, and you can see the scattered background as it appears in the data. When you remove the scattered background, you get these corrected measurements, or corrected reconstructions. 

This demonstrates how the result changes by addressing the scattering problem. Scatter correction is a key point in improving measurement accuracy and image quality.
