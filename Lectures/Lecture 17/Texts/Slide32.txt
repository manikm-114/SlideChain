This is a big picture overview. If you look at the components in detail, multiple figures highlight the power and structure of each unit. You start with a scintillation crystal at the front of each module. The scintillation crystal's job is to convert incoming gamma photons into visible light. This visible light is then captured by a photomultiplier tube, or PMT. The crystal and PMT work together—when the scintillation crystal creates visible light, the photomultiplier tube multiplies and amplifies that light signal, converting it into an electrical current. After the signal passes through the tube, it goes on to electronic circuits that process the electrical impulse.

Depending on the amplitude of that impulse, you can determine the energy of the interacting gamma photon. One unit like this—consisting of an array of crystals and a set of PMTs—is called a "block." Several blocks combined form a "bucket," which can include hundreds of crystals. Multiple buckets are arranged together to create the full detector ring, which collects all the imaging data at once. There are additional engineering details in how these elements are assembled and how the signals are managed, but at its core, this system is designed to efficiently detect and process gamma events for reliable image reconstruction.
