There’s a lot of research going on in this area. I should put another green button here for curiosity’s sake—because some of these ideas can be solved analytically when you assume the attenuation coefficient, mu, is constant. You can use Fourier analysis, closed-form solutions, or algebraic approaches, like solving systems of linear equations.

Just to point out, for those who are curious, there’s a paper shown here about using analytic techniques and the Fourier slice theorem for SPECT. These methods are more complicated than CT, but they show that there are options for solving the reconstruction problem with closed-form solutions or advanced mathematics. Next, let’s look at deterministic PET reconstruction.
