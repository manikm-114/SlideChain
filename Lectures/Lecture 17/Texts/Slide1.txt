Welcome to Lecture 17 on SPECT and PET. Today, we’re finishing the nuclear imaging section. Before I explain the content of this lecture, let’s get started by recalling why these modalities matter in biomedical imaging. SPECT stands for Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography, and PET means Positron Emission Tomography.

Both enable molecular imaging and are vital for diagnostics, functional evaluation. They use specific tracers and detectors, which we’ll explore in detail today
