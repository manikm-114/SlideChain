And Poisson noise, Poisson distribution, you would need some high school statistics, you learned permutations and combinations. And this permutation, you just see the different arrangement, roughly speaking, a combination, you need to just remove those, those essentially the same arrangement like ABC and ACB. 

In terms of combination, you think it's the same thing because this is same three individuals are involved in this activity. So you need just the distinction between permutation and combination. So you can review this slide, you will recall what you learned.
