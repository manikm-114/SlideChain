In PET, you see that the data model has a uniform weighting factor multiplied by the concentration at each location. In previous slides, I mentioned how, when you measure along a longer line, you need to take account of the location, but for PET, you measure all coincident detections. Effectively, you sum or integrate all the individual concentrations, called lambda. The important point is that the attenuation factor remains constant—it doesn’t depend on the source position, so it can be factored out.

If the attenuation coefficient, mu, is known, then it becomes an unknown factor in your measurements. But once you know mu—like if you assume the patient’s body is mostly water, making mu equal to the value for water, or if you measure mu with a dedicated transmission scan—you can normalize your measurements, and you end up with a clean line integral. With lots of gamma photons, the measurements really do reflect the mean, and you can use deterministic reconstruction, like filtered backprojection.

If you know mu from a special transmission scan or by assuming it’s the value for water, then your reconstruction is straightforward. An interesting twist is the time-of-flight approach, which uses the difference in arrival times of photons at the detectors to estimate where the annihilation occurred. By measuring these time differences, you can gain additional information about where the event happened—close to one detector or the other. This time-of-flight technique is advanced, and although we don’t have time to fully cover it here, just know it’s one way to estimate mu and improve PET reconstructions.
