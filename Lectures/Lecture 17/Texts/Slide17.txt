When we talk about PET or paired photon emission models, the weighting factor for attenuation is constant along a given line of response. That means when you do an integral over all source distributions, you can pull this constant weighting factor outside the integral—it doesn't depend on the source position. 

You’ll see how this works more clearly in the next slide. So, let’s shift our focus to image reconstruction, where these ideas become important.
