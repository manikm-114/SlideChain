Anyway, so this is just for your information. The slide summarizes key concepts for SPECT and PET imaging: statistical distributions, how data is modeled with single and paired emissions, various reconstruction methods including attenuation compensation, deterministic, and statistical reconstruction, as well as the architecture of SPECT and PET scanners and scatter correction. 

Finally, it mentions the fully 3D approaches and highlights the importance of the conference and community in advancing this field.
