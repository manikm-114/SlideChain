In pilot imaging, you work with a detector ring. This setup can be used for both human studies and small-animal imaging. Small animals are especially important in pharmaceutical research, since drug companies rely on them to test potential new drugs. The development of a drug typically passes through several phases: starting with cell cultures, then moving to small-animal studies, followed by preclinical trials, clinical trials, and eventually, market approval. Out of hundreds of drug candidates tested, only a very small fraction ever reach the market. This long, costly process is one reason why drug development is so expensive.

The pilot imaging ring itself consists of gamma detectors and the associated electronic circuitry. These detectors not only capture signals but also record timing information. When multiple gamma photons are detected within the same time window, the system identifies them as coming from the same event and reports a coincidence along a line of response. In this way, the line of response corresponds to the radio-tracer distribution along that line, which is essentially a line integral. The attenuation coefficient in this formulation is treated as independent and can be factored out.
