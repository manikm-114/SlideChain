The technical advancement in PET imaging has been driven largely by improvements in detector technology. Over the years, we’ve seen a progression from NaI detectors to BGO, and now to LSO, with each milestone year bringing significant gains in image quality. 

These different generations of detectors reflect long-term innovation in materials, engineering, and system design. As you can see, each new detector technology has resulted in clearer, higher-resolution images. This slide is just for your information; I won’t spend too much time on it, but it’s important to recognize how advancements in detector design have directly impacted the quality of PET images throughout the history of the field.
