Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nTaking all these trivial transformations, here is the property we use and can easily verify in Fourier analysis: when the angle shifts by one hundred eighty degrees, you keep the same angle but reverse the sign of w. With this, you only need the angular range from zero to pi.\n\nNext, change W to minus W. Then the radial limit from zero to infinity becomes zero to minus infinity. Swap the limits, and the inner integral runs from minus infinity to plus infinity. Put everything together and you have:\n\u000b“f at x, y equals the integral from theta equals zero to pi, integral from w equals minus infinity to infinity, S theta of w times absolute value of w times e to the j two pi w t d w, d theta; with t equals x cosine theta plus y sine theta.”\nWhere t equals x cosine theta plus y sine theta.\nAll these are just mathematical details—if you get lost, review and you will be able to follow. The key point is that we end up with this formula. This formula is what we call filtered backprojection. If you got lost somewhere, it is not critical; you can review. But trust me for now—through these steps, you get this result. This is filtered backprojection.\n\nWhy “filtered”? Because here you see S of w—the one-dimensional Fourier spectrum along the radial line—and it is multiplied by the absolute value of w. If you performed the inverse Fourier transform without the absolute value of w, you would go back to the original projection profile, the one-dimensional signal you measured. But with the additional factor absolute value of w, the original Fourier spectrum is modified.\nWhen w is small—near the origin—low-frequency components are weighted small. When w is large—at high frequency—the weighting is large. So S of w times absolute value of w is a high-pass filtering: the high-frequency components are elevated in proportion to absolute value of w. After this spectral modification, you perform the inverse Fourier transform and go back to the projection domain. Because of the high-frequency enhancement, this inverse transform is no longer the original projection profile. Instead, it is a modified, high-pass-filtered projection profile. It is not p theta of t anymore; it is q theta of t, the filtered projection profile. That is why we call it filtered.\n\nWhat do I mean by backprojection? \nYou filter first—this one-dimensional filtration—and then you put the filtered values back into the field of view. According to the argument t equals x cosine theta plus y sine theta, for any x, y you retrieve the value q theta of t from your filtered projection profile and accumulate it back over angles. That step is the backprojection process. “Filtration” may be clear; “backprojection” can feel a little confusing, but it simply means smearing the filtered profile back across the image along the corresponding rays.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
