Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nI uploaded a chapter by Clark in a CT book. It’s a very good one. When I was a fourth-year graduate student, I did a summer job with my supervisor. That summer, I read through his book and implemented the cone-beam reconstruction algorithm. In my view, this is still the best engineering book to explain CT principles. The green textbook explains back-projection, but not as clearly as Clark’s book. To give a better, deeper explanation, we will use Clark’s Chapter 3.\n\nNow the coordinate system is x, y. Draw a line making an angle theta; call this line the t-axis. The projection is defined by the perpendicular distance from a point to the t-axis. The line through the origin at that distance is t. It can be expressed as\u000bx cosine theta plus y sine theta equals t.\nThe unit directional vector along the t-axis has components cosine theta, sine theta. They didn’t draw it, but you can think of cosine theta and sine theta as the two components of the unit vector along the t-direction.\nTake an arbitrary point x, y. Regarding the point as a vector from the origin. Project this vector onto the t-axis. The resulting distance is t. This is really an inner product: one vector with components x, y, and the unit vector with components cosine theta, sine theta. The inner product equals t. As long as t is the same, all points that satisfy this equation lie along the same straight line at a distance t.\n\nYou then do a line integral along that line at an angle theta and distance t. The projection p of theta, t, has two variables, but for a given theta, it is a one-dimensional function of t.\nThis line integral can also be written as a double integral. You integrate the underlying image over the whole plane, and you place a delta function along that line so that only the values on the line contribute. In other words, the double integral with the delta function is nothing but the line integral along that direction. This gives a convenient two-dimensional notation for the projection.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
