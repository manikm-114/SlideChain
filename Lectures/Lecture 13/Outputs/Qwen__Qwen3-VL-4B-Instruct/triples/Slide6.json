Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet me explain a little further. Take an arbitrary picture—say, a portrait of our former president. You can decompose the picture into many, many small elements. For each element, it’s very simple: just a homogeneous pixel, a small square. Add these together. \n\nThe trick is really the amplitude: you need to make sure all these amplitudes are modulated nicely. Then, when you put them together, you have the perception of a picture or a natural scene, whatever. This is one way to represent a picture.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"s\": \"picture\",\n      \"p\": \"represents\",\n      \"o\": \"portrait\",\n      \"modalities\": [\n        \"text\",\n        \"image\"\n      ],\n      \"confidence\": 0.9,\n      \"evidence\": \"Take an arbitrary picture—say, a portrait of our former president.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"s\": \"picture\",\n      \"p\": \"reconstructs_with\",\n      \"o\": \"pixel\",\n      \"modalities\": [\n        \"text\",\n        \"image\"\n      ],\n      \"confidence\": 0.9,\n      \"evidence\": \"You can decompose the picture into many, many small elements.
