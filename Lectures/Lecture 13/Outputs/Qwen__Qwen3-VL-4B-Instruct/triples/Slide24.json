Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nYou can link the t, s coordinates to x, y through a straightforward coordinate transformation. Then you can go through the mathematical derivations to show the Fourier slice theorem in the general case. The theta angle is the same in the u, v domain and in the x, y domain.\n\nWith this coordinate transform, p of theta, t, for angle theta as a function of t, can be expressed as a vertical projection in the t, s coordinate system. Here s is the vertical direction in the t, s system.\n\nNext, perform the one-dimensional Fourier transform. The exponential factor is e to the power minus j two pi w t. Then do the same trick as before: insert the definition of the projection profile for angle theta into the bracket. You get the resulting expression, pretty much like the simplest case we did.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
