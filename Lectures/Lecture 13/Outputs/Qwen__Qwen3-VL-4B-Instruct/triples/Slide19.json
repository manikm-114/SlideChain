Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nIn the so-called Fourier slice theorem, it basically says this: you have the parallel-beam projection. So p of theta—this angle is theta. You get all these projections, and each projection carries wave information along its direction, the X-ray direction.\nThe information carried by this projection profile is waves along the p-axis. This p-axis makes an angle theta. It’s the same idea as before: a vertical projection carries wave information along the horizontal direction. So a projection at angle theta carries wave information along the p-axis, making angle theta.\n\nIf you perform a one-dimensional Fourier analysis, you get the Fourier spectrum. This green profile is the Fourier spectrum of the projection profile. The Fourier spectrum lies along the rho-axis, making the same angle theta. A point on this rho-axis gives a wave whose frequency is proportional to the distance from that point to the system origin. It is a wave propagating along the theta direction, orthogonal to the X-ray beam direction. Along this rho-axis, you have many points; these points represent unique two-dimensional waves propagating along this direction, making an angle theta.\n\nThis is heuristic. You need a one-dimensional Fourier transform to recover a radial line profile in Fourier space. To reconstruct a two-dimensional image, f of x, y, you need all the Fourier information, so the angle theta needs to go from zero to one hundred eighty degrees. When the rho-axis orientation changes from theta equals zero, then one, two, three, up to one hundred eighty degrees, the whole Fourier space is swept by the rho-axis. That means with one projection, you only measure information along one line. But if you change theta from zero to one hundred eighty degrees, all the data points in the Fourier space have been measured—you have all the information. Then you can perform a two-dimensional inverse Fourier transform.\n\nThis is a geometrical perspective on how to reconstruct the image using Fourier analysis, or from a wave-analysis perspective. Just these few things—two slides. I hope you understand these two slides. Then we will take a minute's rest. I will show you my mathematics.\nStep by step, you will understand this geometrical wave argument a little better. OK. I think the algebraic perspective may be easier for you. The wave analysis—if you feel confused, feel free to ask me. Think about it. This is a very elegant way to solve the problem. The Fourier slice theorem is an important theorem for tomographic reconstruction.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
