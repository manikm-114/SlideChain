Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo this is nothing but a vertical integral. A vertical integral is the projection profile when theta equals zero. So that is a vertical integral—you get this.\n\nNow, in two-dimensional Fourier analysis, F of u, zero—F of u, zero—the vertical integral is p at theta equals zero of x. Put this part into the bracket, and then you have this expression.\nSo this is two-dimensional Fourier analysis along the u-axis when v equals zero—this is the u-axis. And here is the vertical integral. The vertical integral is a function of x in the x–y plane. And this part is one-dimensional Fourier analysis with respect to the variable x. So this is the one-dimensional Fourier transform. You can write it as the one-dimensional Fourier transform when theta equals zero, and the variable is u.\n\nThis is the one-dimensional Fourier transform in the general case for an arbitrary angle theta. So this is a special case of what I called the Fourier slice theorem. If you have a vertical projection profile, and you perform one-dimensional Fourier analysis, you get a one-dimensional Fourier spectrum—you got a one-dimensional Fourier spectrum. It is nothing but the projection profile in the two-dimensional Fourier-transform space along the u-axis. So this is a special case of the Fourier slice theorem.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
