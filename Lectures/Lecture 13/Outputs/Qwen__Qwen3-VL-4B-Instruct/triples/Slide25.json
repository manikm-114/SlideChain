Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThen you change the transform back from the t, s system to the x, y coordinate system.\u000b\nYou can express it this way. Rearranging a little, it can be expressed as a two-dimensional Fourier transform, capital F. The u component is w cosine theta, and the v component is w sine theta. Because in the two-dimensional Fourier transform you have x u plus y v, the factor w is redistributed back, giving this relationship.\n\nS theta of w equals F of open parenthesis w cosine theta, w sine theta close parenthesis.\nThis is nothing but the general form of the Fourier slice theorem. This is the mathematical derivation. You can review it yourself and check Chapter 3 if needed.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"s\": \"S_θ(w)\",\n      \"p\": \"represents\",\n      \"o\": \"F(w, θ)=F(w cos θ, w sin θ)\",\n      \"modalities\": [\n        \"text\"\n      ],\n      \"confidence\": 0.95,\n      \"evidence\": \"The right-hand side of this equation now represents the two-dimensional Fourier transform at a spatial frequency of (u = w cos θ, v = w sin θ) or S_θ(w)=F(w, θ)=F(w cos θ, w sin θ).\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
