From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo the continuous-domain expression can be expressed in terms of discrete data points. You get the filtered projection profile in terms of sampled data points. This is the band-limited high-pass filtering. \n\nYou can read more if you are interested, but anyway, these are practical implementation details about high-pass filtering for filtered backprojection. What I have explained here is only the two-dimensional case.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
