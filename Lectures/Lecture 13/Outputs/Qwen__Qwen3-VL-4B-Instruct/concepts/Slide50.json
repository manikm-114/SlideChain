From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nFor homework, review what we did with the block, and do the same steps using an ellipse. \n\nWork through the MATLAB code. Some variable names may not be obvious from the slides, but if you open MATLAB Help or search online, everything is straightforward. Spend some time, get familiar, and see how filtered backprojection works for you. \n\nThat’s all for today—thank you.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
