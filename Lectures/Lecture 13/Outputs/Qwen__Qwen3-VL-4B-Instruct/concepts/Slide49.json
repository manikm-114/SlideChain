From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nOn the top row images, you can see the difference: the unfiltered backprojection is blurry, while the filtered backprojection looks much closer to the original image. This is the key to reconstructing CT images.\n\nThe bottom row shows some clinical examples. It feels like magic. Review the material; if you didn’t do the preview and you don’t review, you won’t catch all the tricks. But if you read carefully, you’ll understand the secret: the X-ray machine sends beams you never see, yet your internal structure is clearly revealed. \n\nYou can resolve features down to about one-third of a millimeter, with every detail laid out by the algorithms I just explained. It’s an amazing achievement—inner vision with X-rays.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
