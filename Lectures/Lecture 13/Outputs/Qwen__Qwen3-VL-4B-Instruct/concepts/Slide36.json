From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo the real example is a simple cross-section with a small bright disk. \n\nYou do one-dimensional projection data acquisition at an angle theta. You get this profile, and you see a peak due to the bright disk. This is at an angle theta. Theta can be changed from zero degrees to pi. As theta changes, the peak traces half of a sinusoidal curve in the sinogram. For this given view, the projection profile is here.\n\nWe have this example, but at different elevations—that is, at different theta angles—you have different data. So, if you do backprojection, what will happen? I explained a lot about backprojection: backprojection is the filtered projection profile smeared back over the field of view. Let me show you what happens. First, let’s not bother with any filtration. This is the projection profile, and I backproject it.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
