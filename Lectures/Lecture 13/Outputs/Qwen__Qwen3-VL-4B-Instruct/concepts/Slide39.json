From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo you have a projection profile. You don’t just smear it back. First, apply a high-pass filter with kernel H. After filtering, you get a high-pass-filtered projection profile, called P-prime of theta, t. \n\nThen you perform backprojection. That’s filtered backprojection: filter each projection with H, and backproject every filtered projection profile.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Reject filler or administrative text.\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\n      \"term\": \"convolve projections with a filter\",\n      \"category\": \"signal_processing\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"backproject filtered projections\",\n      \"category\": \"reconstruction\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"high-pass filter with kernel H\",\n      \"category\": \"signal_processing\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"filtered backprojection\",\n      \"category\": \"algorithm\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"P'(θ,t)\",\n      \"category\": \"signal_processing\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"P(θ,t)\",\n      \"category\": \"signal_processing\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\n    \"convolve projections with a filter\",\n    \"backproject filtered projections\",\n    \"high-pass filter with kernel H\",\n    \"filtered backprojection\",\n    \"P'(θ,t)\",\n    \"P(θ,t)\"\n  ]\n}",
