From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nComputed tomography was previously called computer-aided tomography, C-A-T—so we usually put a cute cat here. C-T is nothing but the inverse process. Once you have sinogram data, p of theta, t, the question is: given the measurements, how do you invert the process?\n\nWhat is the underlying image that explains this data? Once you have the data, you reconstruct the image. The inverse process goes from data to image. X-ray measurement goes from image to data. The tomographic algorithm goes the other way, from data to image, the underlying image.\n\nAnd how do you do it? The picture I gave you shows you can use an impending method, so you have a heuristic feeling.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
