From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNext, the analytic approach involves the Fourier slice theorem—that’s the key point—so we need Fourier analysis.\n\nIf you already understand Fourier analysis very well, you will have a good time here. If you are still confused about Fourier analysis, you may struggle a little, and I recommend a review. This is not an easy topic, but it is very cool. For the Fourier analysis, analytic approach, let me give you a heuristic explanation.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
