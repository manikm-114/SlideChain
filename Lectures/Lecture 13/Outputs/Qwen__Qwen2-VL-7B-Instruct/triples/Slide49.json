Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nOn the top row images, you can see the difference: the unfiltered backprojection is blurry, while the filtered backprojection looks much closer to the original image. This is the key to reconstructing CT images.\n\nThe bottom row shows some clinical examples. It feels like magic. Review the material; if you didn’t do the preview and you don’t review, you won’t catch all the tricks. But if you read carefully, you’ll understand the secret: the X-ray machine sends beams you never see, yet your internal structure is clearly revealed. \n\nYou can resolve features down to about one-third of a millimeter, with every detail laid out by the algorithms I just explained. It’s an amazing achievement—inner vision with X-rays.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"unfiltered backprojection\", \"p\":\"produces\",\n     \"o\":\"blurry image\", \"modalities\":[\"image\"], \"confidence\":1.0, \"evidence\":\"The unfiltered backprojection is blurry.\"}\n  ]\n}",
