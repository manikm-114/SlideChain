Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThen you can recover the original image. This looks very close to the original. If you have many angles, with very small angular increments, and the detector spacing is very small, the result becomes closer and closer to the true image. \n\nThis is just a numerical example. The next few slides show a MATLAB implementation—also your homework—so you can read through and try it yourself.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"Filtered Sinogram\", \"p\":\"produces\", \"o\":\"Reconstructed Image\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":1.0, \"evidence\":\"Filtered Backprojection to Image\"}\n  ]\n}",
