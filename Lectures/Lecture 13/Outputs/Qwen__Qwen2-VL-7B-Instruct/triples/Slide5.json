Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s take a moment to underline the information. Like in physics, we have a particle property and a wave property. For image reconstruction, we can make an analogy. We can view the underlying image in two ways.\u000b\nFirst, we view the image as a collection of pixels if the image is two-dimensional, or as pixels for three-dimensional images—a collection of particles—here meaning picture elements; the pixels, the pixels (for 3-D, these are often called voxels).\u000b\nThe other way is complementary: we view the image as a superposition of waves. For a two-dimensional image, for example, think of the image as a summation of many waves propagating along different orientations. For a given orientation, the wave can be at different frequencies, and you have amplitude, frequency, and phase. If all these parameters are set correctly and you add all these waves together, you obtain the image. This is the basic, high-level idea—the particle and wave perspectives of the image and of image reconstruction.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
