Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet me visualize what we mentioned.\u000b\nYou have the underlying image f of x and y, and using X-ray measurements, you get the projection profile p of theta and t. For a given theta, you perform a one-dimensional Fourier transform with respect to t. You get a line profile, making the angle theta in the two-dimensional Fourier space.\n\nBut theta can be changed as you wish from zero to pi, that is, zero to one hundred eighty degrees. So you get a line for theta equals zero, a line for theta equals fifteen degrees, a line for theta equals eighty degrees, and a line for theta equals one hundred seventy degrees, for example. When theta changes from zero to one hundred eighty degrees, all these radial lines will fully cover the Fourier space u, v. All the values are measured this way.\n\nWhen you know f of u, v completely, you perform the inverse Fourier transform and recover f of x, y. So the analytic process here is completed using the Fourier transform, particularly in the form of the Fourier slice theorem. This is a Fourier imaging example: we explain measured data in the Fourier space. We try to fill the Fourier space completely, and then we can perform image reconstruction.\nThis is just a little more specialized idea of how you use the Fourier transform to do CT reconstruction.\u000b\nOkay.\nSo let me go a step deeper. This is the general idea. First, I explained the general idea, then I explained the Fourier slice theorem, a little more specifically.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
