Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nWelcome back. We can see today’s topic is CT Reconstruction. \n\nIn this session, we’ll build on that foundation and map raw X-ray measurements into cross-sectional images. By the end, you’ll have a clear roadmap of the reconstruction pipeline and where classic methods, such as filtered back-projection and modern iterative ideas, fit into an online, real-world CT workflow.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"CT Reconstruction\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\", \"o\":\"cross-sectional images\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"In this session, we’ll build on that foundation and map raw X-ray measurements into cross-sectional images.\"}\n  ]\n}",
