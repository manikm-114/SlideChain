From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nWelcome back. We can see today’s topic is CT Reconstruction. \n\nIn this session, we’ll build on that foundation and map raw X-ray measurements into cross-sectional images. By the end, you’ll have a clear roadmap of the reconstruction pipeline and where classic methods, such as filtered back-projection and modern iterative ideas, fit into an online, real-world CT workflow.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
