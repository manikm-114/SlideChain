From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s take a look at the roadmap: we’re at the CT Reconstruction milestone. Keep one core idea in mind from the physics background—the roles of the X-ray source, the detector, and how a measurement is formed. Each reading can be interpreted as a line integral of the attenuation coefficient along a straight ray. \n\u000bWith that model in place, we now focus on algorithms that invert those line integrals to recover cross-sectional images. If you’d like more depth on the geometry or notation, the companion reading for this module provides it\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
