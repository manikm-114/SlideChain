From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow we assume capital W is the maximum bandwidth. Because of that, we can use the sampling theorem. The projection profile can be expressed through the sampling kernel in terms of discrete sampling points P theta at k tau—where tau is the sampling step. \n\nLikewise, the filtering kernel, under the assumption of limited bandwidth capital W, can be expressed in terms of sampled values. So you get these two equations.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
