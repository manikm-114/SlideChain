From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo you have a projection profile. You don’t just smear it back. First, apply a high-pass filter with kernel H. After filtering, you get a high-pass-filtered projection profile, called P-prime of theta, t. \n\nThen you perform backprojection. That’s filtered backprojection: filter each projection with H, and backproject every filtered projection profile.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
