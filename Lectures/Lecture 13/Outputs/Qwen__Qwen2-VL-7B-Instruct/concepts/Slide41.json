From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThen you can recover the original image. This looks very close to the original. If you have many angles, with very small angular increments, and the detector spacing is very small, the result becomes closer and closer to the true image. \n\nThis is just a numerical example. The next few slides show a MATLAB implementation—also your homework—so you can read through and try it yourself.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
