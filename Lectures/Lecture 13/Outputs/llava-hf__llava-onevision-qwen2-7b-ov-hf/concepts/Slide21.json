From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThen we can write the standard Fourier transform for the underlying function f of x, y. Equation seven is the two-dimensional Fourier transform—straightforward. Let me write the one-dimensional Fourier transform—just the definition—equation eight. \n\nI have the one-dimensional function, which is the projection profile p of theta, t. It has one variable. Then you perform the Fourier transform, and you get the one-dimensional Fourier transform with frequency variable w. Here, the two-dimensional frequency variables are u and v. These two are just definitions of the two-dimensional and one-dimensional Fourier transforms.\n\nNow let’s go a little further. Consider the simplest example, the simplest case, and we try to compute the Fourier analysis. Fourier analysis is a two-dimensional function of u, v, but we set v equal to zero. That means we only consider Fourier coefficients along the u-axis—that’s just one line through the two-dimensional Fourier spectrum. Given v equals zero, this becomes a one-dimensional function. So equation seven becomes equation nine. With v equal to zero, you get this part.\n\nRearrange this a little bit, because now the kernel, the exponential function, does not depend on y. So the integral with respect to y can be grouped into the inner integral. You get this part. And you see that the expression in the bracket is nothing but a vertical integral. Because you have a two-dimensional function, you just do the line integral along the y-axis. So this part in the bracket is nothing but a vertical integral.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
