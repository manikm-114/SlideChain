From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThe measurement can be written in line-integral form or in ray-sum form. Let me explain.\n\nFirst, we have an incoming intensity, N i, and an output intensity, N o. The output is related to the input through linear attenuation. For a single element along the ray, the attenuation is mu times delta x, where delta x is the pixel size.\nWith multiple material components along the path, the incoming intensity is attenuated by the first pixel; the output of the first pixel becomes the input to the second pixel, and so on. Adding these effects together gives the standard relationship. This is a quick review of the earlier module.\n\nThe attenuated output equals the input multiplied by an exponential factor whose exponent is the negative sum of the little mu k values, each weighted by delta x. This is our imaging model or data model.\nWhat is known and what is unknown?\u000bKnown: N i, N o, and the step size delta x that we choose.\u000bUnknown: the set mu k, for k equals 1, 2, 3, …, n.\n\nNormalize by taking a ratio and then a natural logarithm:\n“Natural log of N i divided by N o equals the sum over k of mu k times delta x.”\nThis is a linear equation in the unknowns mu k, with delta x acting as a weight. Because N i and N o are measured, the right-hand side is known after the log. For each X-ray path, we obtain one linear equation. With many paths, we obtain a system of linear equations, often written compactly as A times x equals b. In this algebraic view, the image is treated as pixels, and each measurement provides a linear constraint on those pixel values.\nIf we take the limit as delta x becomes very small, the sum becomes an integral:\n“The integral along the ray of mu of x, d x, equals the natural log of N i over N o.”\n\nSo, in the discrete domain we speak of a ray-sum—a summation—and in the continuous domain we speak of a line integral—an integral along the X-ray path. Either way, X-ray measurements provide ray-sums or line integrals of the attenuation field. With this model in mind, we can now discuss why the resulting linear system can have a unique solution, at least heuristically.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
