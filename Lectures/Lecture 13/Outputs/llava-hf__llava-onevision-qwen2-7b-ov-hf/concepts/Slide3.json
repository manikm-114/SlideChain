From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s take a look at a few habits that make this module easier.\u000b\nFirst, recommended reading: Ge’s book and the widely used “Green Book.” Together, they give both intuition and practical formulas. Next, focus on the logic flow in the video lessons and slides—how each idea leads to the next. Aim to capture the key concepts rather than memorize isolated facts.\u000b\nBuild skills by working on problems from homework and textbook questions; problem-solving is where concepts become durable.\u000bAdopt a simple routine: preview → learn → review → repeat. Preview the slide headlines, watch the lesson, then review by summarizing in your own words and redoing one or two problems.\u000b\nFor foundations, give extra attention to Fourier analysis and the sampling theorem—these are the grammar of modern imaging. They will pay off when we study CT filtered back-projection and, later, MRI pulse sequences and other modalities. If questions come up, post them in the course Q&A so others can benefit too.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"Fourier analysis\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"Sampling theorem\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"CT filtered back-projection\", \"category\": \"reconstruction\"},\n    {\"term\": \"MRI pulse sequences\", \"category\": \"reconstruction\"},\n    {\"term\": \"Fourier transform\", \"category\": \"frequency_domain\"},\n    {\"term\": \"Sampling\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"Image reconstruction\", \"category\": \"reconstruction\"},\n    {\"term\": \"Fourier transform\", \"category\": \"frequency_domain\"},\n    {\"term\": \"Sampling theorem\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"Ge’s book and the widely used “Green Book.” Together, they give both intuition and practical formulas.\", \"Adopt a simple routine: preview → learn → review → repeat.
