From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nWhen you do projection, they basically decompose a single pixel into a two-by-two matrix, then shoot rays through all these centers into the projection domain. \n\nIf a ray hits the center of a detector bin, that detector takes the full value. If it hits the boundary between two detector bins, the value is divided equally. If it hits at an arbitrary location, linear interpolation is used.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"projection\", \"category\": \"reconstruction\"},\n    {\"term\": \"two-by-two matrix\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"rays\", \"category\": \"physics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"center of a detector bin\", \"category\": \"instrumentation\"},\n    {\"term\": \"boundary between two detector bins\", \"category\": \"instrumentation\"},\n    {\"term\": \"arbitrary location\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"linear interpolation\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"value\", \"category\": \"data_processing\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"When you do projection, they basically decompose a single pixel into a two-by-two matrix, then shoot rays through all these centers into the projection domain.\", \"If a ray hits the center of a detector bin, that detector takes the full value.
