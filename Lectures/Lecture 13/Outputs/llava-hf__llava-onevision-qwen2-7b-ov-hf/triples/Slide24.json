Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nYou can link the t, s coordinates to x, y through a straightforward coordinate transformation. Then you can go through the mathematical derivations to show the Fourier slice theorem in the general case. The theta angle is the same in the u, v domain and in the x, y domain.\n\nWith this coordinate transform, p of theta, t, for angle theta as a function of t, can be expressed as a vertical projection in the t, s coordinate system. Here s is the vertical direction in the t, s system.\n\nNext, perform the one-dimensional Fourier transform. The exponential factor is e to the power minus j two pi w t. Then do the same trick as before: insert the definition of the projection profile for angle theta into the bracket. You get the resulting expression, pretty much like the simplest case we did.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"Fourier slice theorem\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"Coordinate transformation\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"You can link the t, s coordinates to x, y through a straightforward coordinate transformation.\"}\n  ]\n}",
