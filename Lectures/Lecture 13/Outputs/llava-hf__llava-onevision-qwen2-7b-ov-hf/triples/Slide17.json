Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNext, the analytic approach involves the Fourier slice theorem—that’s the key point—so we need Fourier analysis.\n\nIf you already understand Fourier analysis very well, you will have a good time here. If you are still confused about Fourier analysis, you may struggle a little, and I recommend a review. This is not an easy topic, but it is very cool. For the Fourier analysis, analytic approach, let me give you a heuristic explanation.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"Fourier analysis\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"analytic approach\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"The analytic approach involves the Fourier slice theorem—that’s the key point—so we need Fourier analysis.\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
