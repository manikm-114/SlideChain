Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo, in summary, the algebraic approach goes in the following steps.\nFirst, convert the data into line integrals to form a system of linear equations.\u000bThis is the first step.\n\nSecond, solve the system of linear equations to reconstruct the underlying image, like the iterative process I showed you.\nIf needed—although I didn’t explain the details—you regularize the reconstruction with prior knowledge. For example, you know the CT attenuation coefficient, mu, determines attenuated X-ray intensity and cannot be negative. So, during the iterative process, if the current solution gives a negative value, you know it cannot be negative; you force the negative to zero. That is how prior knowledge regularizes the image reconstruction.\n\nThen you iteratively refine the intermediate image, or current guess, one cycle at a time until the outcome is satisfactory.\nHow do you know the outcome is satisfactory? One way is visual—the image makes sense given your prior knowledge. Another way is data consistency—based on your current image, you predict the projection data; if your prediction compares well with the measurement—very close—you say, okay, it is good enough. As far as data fitness is concerned, we are doing a good job.\n\nSo, that is the idea of the first algebraic approach. The first one is not very hard, but at least you are sure that we can do it.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
