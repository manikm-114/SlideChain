Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nWhen you do projection, they basically decompose a single pixel into a two-by-two matrix, then shoot rays through all these centers into the projection domain. \n\nIf a ray hits the center of a detector bin, that detector takes the full value. If it hits the boundary between two detector bins, the value is divided equally. If it hits at an arbitrary location, linear interpolation is used.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"projection\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"ray\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"decompose a single pixel into a two-by-two matrix, then shoot rays through all these centers into the projection domain\"}\n  ],\n    {\"s\":\"ray\", \"p\":\"hits|meets\",\n     \"o\":\"center of a detector bin\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"hits the center of a detector bin, that detector takes the full value\"}\n  ],\n    {\"s\":\"ray\", \"p\":\"hits|meets\",\n     \"o\":\"boundary between two detector bins\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"hits the boundary between two detector bins, the value is divided equally\"}\n  ],\n    {\"s\":\"ray\", \"p\":\"hits|meets\",\n     \"o\":\"arbitrary location\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"hits at an arbitrary location",
