  "raw_output": "user \nSystem:\nYou are extracting factual relations from a medical imaging lecture. Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo this is the projection profile, something like this. You do backprojection—you smear the profile back along the original X-ray path over the field of view. The higher value here is put back, so along this line, the value is placed at every pixel on the line. Here, the value is a little low, so along this line, every point is a little dark. You find the pixels on that line, take the value, and smear it back.\n\nThis is from one direction. You do the same from every direction. The smear-back results are added together, because the integral with respect to d-theta is just a summation. You smear back one projection—you get a picture like this. You take another projection—you smear back the other way. You add the two together. Many projections add many contributions together.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"projection profile\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"smear back\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"You do backprojection—you smear the profile back along the original X-ray path over the field of view.\"}\n  ]\n}",
