Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAnother way, as mentioned, is Fourier analysis. In a two-dimensional picture, you perform a Fourier analysis and obtain a Fourier spectrum.\n\nPick any point: the frequency is proportional to the distance from the origin to that point in the Fourier domain. In this example, you see the frequency, and you also have an amplitude proportional to the value at this particular point. That gives a particular wave propagating along that direction.\n\nFourier analysis uses all kinds of wave components: the DC component, horizontal waves, vertical waves, low frequency, high frequency, and waves that propagate in arbitrary directions—all these kinds of waves. The trick is the setting of the parameters. Once you find the coefficients, you add the Fourier components together, and then you can recover the image—in this case, Albert Einstein. \n\nSo there are two ways, and based on these two perspectives, we can have two approaches.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"Fourier analysis\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"image\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"In a two-dimensional picture, you perform a Fourier analysis and obtain a Fourier spectrum.\"}\n  ]\n}",
