Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo the continuous-domain expression can be expressed in terms of discrete data points. You get the filtered projection profile in terms of sampled data points. This is the band-limited high-pass filtering. \n\nYou can read more if you are interested, but anyway, these are practical implementation details about high-pass filtering for filtered backprojection. What I have explained here is only the two-dimensional case.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1].
