Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nComputed tomography was previously called computer-aided tomography, C-A-T—so we usually put a cute cat here. C-T is nothing but the inverse process. Once you have sinogram data, p of theta, t, the question is: given the measurements, how do you invert the process?\n\nWhat is the underlying image that explains this data? Once you have the data, you reconstruct the image. The inverse process goes from data to image. X-ray measurement goes from image to data. The tomographic algorithm goes the other way, from data to image, the underlying image.\n\nAnd how do you do it? The picture I gave you shows you can use an impending method, so you have a heuristic feeling.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"Computed tomography\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"Inversion process\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"Once you have sinogram data, p of theta, t, the question is: given the measurements, how do you invert the process?
