Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nFrom one hundred eighty degrees, you add everything together. You get something not too much different from the truth, but it looks very blurred. You still see a region that is a little high, because this part of the projection is high. When you backproject along the original X-ray paths, that high value is placed along those lines.\n\nHowever, there are artifacts. In the smearing-back process, a high value here gets spread to places that are not actually high in the object. Backprojection alone smears the high values around. So, simply collecting projections and doing backprojection is not enough to recover an accurate image. That is why we really need to filter the projections.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"projection\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"backprojection\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"When you backproject along the original X-ray paths, that high value is placed along those lines.\"}\n  ]\n}",
