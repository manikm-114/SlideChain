  "raw_output": "user \nSystem:\nYou are extracting factual relations from a medical imaging lecture. Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAnd in the three-dimensional case, you have an extended, higher-dimensional version of the Fourier slice theorem. The mathematics is a little more complicated, but the essential idea is still the same.\n\nYou have a 3-D object. You view it as a superposition of 3-D waves—not 2-D waves—with all kinds of orientations and frequencies. When you form a projection from one direction and superimpose contributions along that direction, you only get information for the wave components whose directional vector and frequency components lie in the plane orthogonal to the projection direction. \nIn other words, the 2-D Fourier transform of a 2-D projection gives you a central plane through the 3-D Fourier transform of the object, oriented perpendicular to the projection rays. This is really just the extension of the 2-D Fourier slice theorem.\n\nI don’t want to confuse you too much—again, you see this nice green button.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"Fourier slice theorem\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"3-D object\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"The Fourier slice theorem is used to form a projection from one direction and superimpose contributions along that direction.\"}\n  ]\n}",
