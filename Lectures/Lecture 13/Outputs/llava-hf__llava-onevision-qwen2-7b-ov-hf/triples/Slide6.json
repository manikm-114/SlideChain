Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet me explain a little further. Take an arbitrary picture—say, a portrait of our former president. You can decompose the picture into many, many small elements. For each element, it’s very simple: just a homogeneous pixel, a small square. Add these together. \n\nThe trick is really the amplitude: you need to make sure all these amplitudes are modulated nicely. Then, when you put them together, you have the perception of a picture or a natural scene, whatever. This is one way to represent a picture.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"picture\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"small square\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"Take an arbitrary picture—say, a portrait of our former president.
