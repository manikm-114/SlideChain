Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s take a look at the roadmap: we’re at the CT Reconstruction milestone. Keep one core idea in mind from the physics background—the roles of the X-ray source, the detector, and how a measurement is formed. Each reading can be interpreted as a line integral of the attenuation coefficient along a straight ray. \n\u000bWith that model in place, we now focus on algorithms that invert those line integrals to recover cross-sectional images. If you’d like more depth on the geometry or notation, the companion reading for this module provides it\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1].
