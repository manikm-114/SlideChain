Then you change the transform back from the t, s system to the x, y coordinate system.
You can express it this way. Rearranging a little, it can be expressed as a two-dimensional Fourier transform, capital F. The u component is w cosine theta, and the v component is w sine theta. Because in the two-dimensional Fourier transform you have x u plus y v, the factor w is redistributed back, giving this relationship.

S theta of w equals F of open parenthesis w cosine theta, w sine theta close parenthesis.
This is nothing but the general form of the Fourier slice theorem. This is the mathematical derivation. You can review it yourself and check Chapter 3 if needed.
