Next, the analytic approach involves the Fourier slice theorem—that’s the key point—so we need Fourier analysis.

If you already understand Fourier analysis very well, you will have a good time here. If you are still confused about Fourier analysis, you may struggle a little, and I recommend a review. This is not an easy topic, but it is very cool. For the Fourier analysis, analytic approach, let me give you a heuristic explanation.
