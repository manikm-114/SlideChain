And in the three-dimensional case, you have an extended, higher-dimensional version of the Fourier slice theorem. The mathematics is a little more complicated, but the essential idea is still the same.

You have a 3-D object. You view it as a superposition of 3-D waves—not 2-D waves—with all kinds of orientations and frequencies. When you form a projection from one direction and superimpose contributions along that direction, you only get information for the wave components whose directional vector and frequency components lie in the plane orthogonal to the projection direction. 
In other words, the 2-D Fourier transform of a 2-D projection gives you a central plane through the 3-D Fourier transform of the object, oriented perpendicular to the projection rays. This is really just the extension of the 2-D Fourier slice theorem.

I don’t want to confuse you too much—again, you see this nice green button.
