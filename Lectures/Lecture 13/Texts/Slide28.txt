So you put the inverse Fourier transform in terms of the polar coordinate system. In polar coordinates, the angle theta goes a full circle, and the radius W goes from zero at the origin all the way to infinity. That covers the full space.

Then we do a little trick. We decompose the full circle into two half-scans: from zero to pi, and from pi to two pi. For the second part, I write theta plus pi instead of just theta. That is why the interval from pi to two pi becomes zero to pi after the change of variables. So you get this form.

For parallel-beam geometry, the angular range of zero to one hundred eighty degrees is enough. If you scan from zero to three hundred sixty degrees, you simply double the information; you really need only half of it.
Mathematically, we handle this by changing the capital F of W, theta, plus one hundred eighty degrees back to a function of theta. Use the identities cosine of theta plus pi equals minus cosine theta, and sine of theta plus pi equals minus sine theta.
