Now let’s go even deeper and give a specific algorithm called filtered backprojection. This is nothing but the inverse Fourier transform, not in the rectangular coordinate system, but in the polar coordinate system, because we keep changing theta. So we should represent the inverse Fourier transform in polar coordinates, so that what you measure in polar coordinates fits directly into the formula.

Let me go through the mathematical steps. This is the inverse two-dimensional Fourier transform. If you know the two-dimensional Fourier spectrum, capital F of u, v, you perform the inverse transform, and you get f of x, y.
My motivation is to use polar coordinates. In polar coordinates, you have radial lines in the Fourier space. That radial variable is W—this is really the rho I showed you before—and the polar angle is theta. Sou equals W times cosine theta, and v equals W times sine theta. That is the polar-to-rectangular coordinate transformation.

For d u d v, the small differential area element, in polar coordinates, you need W dW d theta. The small area element d u d v becomes W dW d theta in polar form. Here, W is the radius. A small angle d theta gives an arc length W d theta. A small radial increment dW gives the thickness. Multiply them together and you get the small area element. This is just your calculus: W dW d theta.
