So you have a projection profile. You don’t just smear it back. First, apply a high-pass filter with kernel H. After filtering, you get a high-pass-filtered projection profile, called P-prime of theta, t. 

Then you perform backprojection. That’s filtered backprojection: filter each projection with H, and backproject every filtered projection profile.
