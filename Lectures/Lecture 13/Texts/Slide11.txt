So, mathematically, we can state a data sufficiency condition for two-dimensional image reconstruction. You have a cross-section, and you arbitrarily draw lines—these are the X-ray paths. For any such line, we say you can find at least one source position. 

What does that mean? It means that along this line, an X-ray source sends rays in this direction, so the line integral, or ray-sum, is measured. It doesn’t mean you have every piece of information you might want. It means: if a line intersects the cross-section, then we have data on that line. That is the maximum amount of data you could have, and, under this simple understanding, that amount is sufficient.

This is the way I understand the subject and how I try to explain it to students. I like to give you a picture and some visual, geometrical ideas. If you feel confused, you can watch my lesson. Right now, I think there are about half a million viewers, a lot of likes, so I really hope your watch gives me a like—that’s good.

Some other heuristics are very important but not easy. For example, when you compute the coefficient, think of it as an inner product—a high-dimensional vector projected onto a basis function. That is a very important heuristic, but I doubt all of you fully understand it. If you don’t, please review. I hope, by the end of this month, to upload a newer version that will be much better than the rough draft, so please read it. Even if I wouldn’t test it again, you need to understand Fourier analysis so that you understand CT and MRI much better. Anyway, this is the idea of the data sufficiency condition.
