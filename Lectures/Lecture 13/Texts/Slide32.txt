So the continuous-domain expression can be expressed in terms of discrete data points. You get the filtered projection profile in terms of sampled data points. This is the band-limited high-pass filtering. 

You can read more if you are interested, but anyway, these are practical implementation details about high-pass filtering for filtered backprojection. What I have explained here is only the two-dimensional case.
