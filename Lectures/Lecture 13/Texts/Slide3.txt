Let’s take a look at a few habits that make this module easier.
First, recommended reading: Ge’s book and the widely used “Green Book.” Together, they give both intuition and practical formulas. Next, focus on the logic flow in the video lessons and slides—how each idea leads to the next. Aim to capture the key concepts rather than memorize isolated facts.
Build skills by working on problems from homework and textbook questions; problem-solving is where concepts become durable.Adopt a simple routine: preview → learn → review → repeat. Preview the slide headlines, watch the lesson, then review by summarizing in your own words and redoing one or two problems.
For foundations, give extra attention to Fourier analysis and the sampling theorem—these are the grammar of modern imaging. They will pay off when we study CT filtered back-projection and, later, MRI pulse sequences and other modalities. If questions come up, post them in the course Q&A so others can benefit too.
