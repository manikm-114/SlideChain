From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLooking ahead, many of you will have families of your own. When a family member gets a scan or a test result, wouldn’t you want to understand what’s happening?\n\nThat’s where this course really empowers you.\n\nEven if you don’t go into imaging research, even if you don’t become a radiologist or an imaging scientist, just being able to interpret results and ask the right questions can make a big difference.\n\nSo that’s the first reason: personal and practical value. Now let’s move on to the second one—your career.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
