From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLooking ahead, the next lecture will focus on building a solid foundation in MATLAB, which will be essential as we move into topics like Fourier transforms and linear systems. Rather than just listening my lecture passively, you will be using MATLAB directly, as this hands-on approach will help you understand key concepts like convolution and the Fourier transform in a deeper, more practical way.\n\nMATLAB is an invaluable tool used across many disciplines; for example, medical imaging and biomedical engineering in general. It will be an important part of your learning journey. If you don't have it installed yet, you can easily download it from the official MATLAB website—this is freely available to you. If you run into any installation issues, support is readily available through your university’s resources, such as the IT support team.\n\nTo get started, I recommend completing the MATLAB On-ramp tutorial, which is a two-hour interactive course that will walk you through the basics. I've personally found this tutorial very effective in building MATLAB skills, and it’s designed for learners of all levels. Rather than only spending time in the next lecture on MatLab, I encourage you to complete this on your own time before the next lecture. This will give you the background you need and prepare you for the upcoming lessons, where we’ll apply these concepts together.\n\nLet me make it your homework: going through the MATLAB On-ramp. By the end of that session, you should be comfortable with MATLAB’s interface and basic functions. Then, you’ll be ready to learn more.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
