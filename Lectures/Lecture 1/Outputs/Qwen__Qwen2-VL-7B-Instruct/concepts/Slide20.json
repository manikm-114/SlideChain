From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, for those of you considering a concentration in imaging—or even just taking this course seriously—it can really pay off in your career.\n\nMedical imaging is a technical field, but it’s also full of opportunities. If you understand how imaging systems work, and you can apply that knowledge to real-world problems, you’ll bring serious value to any team—whether in research, healthcare, or industry.\n\nAnd in case you’re still wondering: yes, biomedical engineering is a great profession. It sits at the intersection of life sciences, medicine, and engineering—and that makes it both exciting and employable.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
