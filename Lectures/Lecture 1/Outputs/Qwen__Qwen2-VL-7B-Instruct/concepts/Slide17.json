From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet me share something personal with you.\n\nA couple of years ago, I had a kidney stone. Not fun. I ended up in the hospital, they injected a contrast agent, ran a CT scan, and just like that—they could see the size and location of the stone.\n\nNow, because I understood what was going on, I wasn’t worried or confused. I could follow the diagnosis, and I knew what the doctors were looking for.\n\nAnd honestly, sooner or later, most of us will have a medical scan—whether it’s an X-ray, a CT, or an MRI. And perhaps, all of them and multiple times. It could be you, or someone you love. When that happens, wouldn’t it be helpful to understand what those images mean?\n\nThat’s why this knowledge matters—not just in theory, but in real life.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
