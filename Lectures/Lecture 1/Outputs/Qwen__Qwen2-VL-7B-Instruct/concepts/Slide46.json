From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nYou’ll notice that this course is not just about the theory—it’s also about putting those theories into practice. For example, you can use MATLAB to simulate various types of data processing. It’s not about learning complicated tricks; it’s about using basic MATLAB functions to analyze data, visualize results, and perform tasks that will help with your assignments.\n\nRemember, the goal here is not to get bogged down in fancy techniques. Rather, we want to ensure that you have a solid foundation in MATLAB so that when it’s time to do your homework or apply concepts like the Fourier transform or linear systems, you’ll have the tool you need to execute them effectively. Now, ChatGPT is a great tool to help you develop MatLab codes.  Please keep this in mind and become familiar with ChatGPT in this context.\n\nWith hands-on practice, you'll get familiar with the interface and the functionality, making your learning process or workflow more effective and more efficient. It’s all about building that confidence through practical experience.\n\nSo, let’s keep learning with MATLAB. By engaging with it now, you’ll set yourself up for success in the course.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
