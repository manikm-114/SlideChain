From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHi everyone, and welcome to this online course on Medical Imaging. I’m Professor Ge Wang, and I’ll be guiding you through this exciting journey.\n\nMedical imaging is a fascinating and powerful field. It brings together science, engineering, and medicine to help us see what’s happening inside the human body—without making a single cut. Whether your background is in engineering, physics, computer science, or biology, you’ll find that medical imaging offers something valuable and fascinating.\n\nIn the weeks ahead, we’ll build a strong foundation in the core principles of imaging and describe a variety of technologies that are transforming modern healthcare. I'm excited to get started—and I hope you are too.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
