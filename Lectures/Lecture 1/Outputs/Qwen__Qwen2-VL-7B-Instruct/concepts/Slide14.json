From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, here’s the point: inversion is hard. Much harder than the forward process.\n\nIn a forward problem, you start with all the information, and you calculate the outcome. That’s usually pretty straightforward. But an inverse problem is the opposite: you’re starting with the outcome, and trying to infer what caused it.\n\nAnd this is where things get tricky. There might be multiple possible answers, or the data might be noisy or incomplete. You need to bring in clever mathematics, algorithms, physical models, and prior knowledge to make sense of it all.\n\nThat’s why this course isn’t just about memorizing facts. It’s about developing your quantitative thinking and really understanding what’s going on underneath the surface. It’s challenging—but if you put in the effort, it’s also incredibly rewarding.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
