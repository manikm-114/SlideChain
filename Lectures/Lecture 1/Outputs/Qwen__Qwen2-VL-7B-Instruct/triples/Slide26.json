Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, within GE, one of the most important innovation engines is their Global Research Center. This is where long-term, high-impact R&D happens.\n\nTheir record speaks for itself—two Nobel Prizes, major contributions to physics, chemistry, materials, energy, and of course, medical imaging.\n\nIn 1984, they played a critical role in the development of MRI systems. And in 1999, digital X-ray systems came out of their labs. They’ve consistently been at the forefront of translating ideas into real-world technologies. My lab and Global Research Center has been closely collaborating on medical imaging over decades. \n\nSo when we say medical imaging sits at the cutting edge of innovation—we mean it.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
