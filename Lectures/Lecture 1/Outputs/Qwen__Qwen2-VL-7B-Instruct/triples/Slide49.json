Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nBuilding on what we have discussed so far about the intersection of medical imaging and machine learning, let’s take a moment to look further ahead.\n\nI truly believe the future of medical imaging—and medicine in general—is full of incredible possibilities. As artificial intelligence continues to advance, we’re already seeing systems that can match or even surpass human performance in interpreting medical images. It’s very possible that, in the not-so-distant future, many of the tasks traditionally done by radiologists will be basically handled by AI.\n\nAnd it goes beyond that. Imagine robotic surgeons, guided by multimodal imaging and machine learning, performing procedures with precision that’s hard for even the best human surgeon to match. Over time, we might see AI and robotics take on more and more roles in healthcare, not to replace professionals, but to enhance what we can achieve—and to make healthcare safer, faster, and more accessible.\n\nThis is the direction the field is moving in, and it’s one of the reasons why understanding imaging technologies today is so valuable and timely. You're not just learning how things work now—you’re preparing to shape the future.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
