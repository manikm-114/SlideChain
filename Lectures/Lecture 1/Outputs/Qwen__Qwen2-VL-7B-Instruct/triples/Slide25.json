Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSpeaking of innovation—let’s talk about one of the major players in the field: General Electric, or GE, in the neighborhood of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.\n\nThis is a company with a deep history of technological contributions, not just in medical imaging, but across many industries. And interestingly, “GE” also happens to be my initials—but theirs is with a capital E. So, no confusion!\n\nGE was founded back in 1892, not long after X-rays were discovered. And Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute was founded even earlier. So these two organizations have grown side by side, both focused on pushing the boundaries of science and technology.\n\nGE has been part of some most transformative developments in imaging—from early X-ray machines to advanced MR scanners. They’ve really helped shape this field.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}",
