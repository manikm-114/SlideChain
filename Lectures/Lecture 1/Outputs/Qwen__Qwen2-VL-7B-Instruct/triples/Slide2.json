Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nWe’ll begin with the fundamentals — systems, Fourier analysis, signal processing — and hands-on MATLAB sessions. Then we’ll explore major imaging techniques: X-ray and radiography, CT, PET, SPECT, MRI, ultrasound, optical, and deep imaging. Along the way, we’ll have three exams to help you review and reinforce what you learn\n\n\nNow, just a quick note: in a traditional classroom, I’d mention office hours; however, since this is an online course, I encourage you to participate actively in our discussion forums. Don’t hesitate to post questions or thoughts as they come up. Learning is always more effective when it's interactive.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"Introduction\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\", \"o\":\"MatLab I (Basics)\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"Course Schedule\"}\n  ]\n}",
