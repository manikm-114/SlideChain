From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s zoom out for a moment and look at biomedical engineering as a field.\n\nIt’s one of the newest branches of engineering. Engineering started with disciplines like civil and mechanical, then moved into electrical, chemical, and aerospace. More recently, biomedical engineering emerged to bridge the gap between technology and medicine.\n\nAnd it’s grown fast—because it’s relevant, it’s interdisciplinary, and it’s impactful.\n\nIn many universities, biomedical engineering includes at least two major focus areas. One is imaging, which is what we’re covering here. The other is tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, often called TERM.\n\nWhether or not you plan to specialize in imaging, this course plays a foundational role. It builds your technical knowledge, strengthens your systems thinking, and helps you understand one of the most important technologies in healthcare today.\n\nSo if you’re here as part of your degree requirements—great. But don’t just treat it like a checkbox. Learn it well. It will pay off, academically, professionally, and personally.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Reject filler or administrative text.\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\n      \"term\": \"biomedical engineering\",\n      \"category\": \"modality\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"imaging\",\n      \"category\": \"modality\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"tissue engineering and regenerative medicine\",\n      \"category\": \"modality\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"TERM\",\n      \"category\": \"modality\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"civil, mechanical\",\n      \"category\": \"mathematics\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"electrical & computer\",\n      \"category\": \"mathematics\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"chemistry\",\n      \"category\": \"mathematics\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"biology & medicine\",\n      \"category\": \"mathematics\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"physics\",\n      \"category\": \"physics\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"mathematics\",\n      \"category\": \"mathematics\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"signal_processing\",\n      \"category\": \"signal_processing\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"frequency_domain\",\n      \"category\": \"frequency_domain\"\n    },\n    {",
