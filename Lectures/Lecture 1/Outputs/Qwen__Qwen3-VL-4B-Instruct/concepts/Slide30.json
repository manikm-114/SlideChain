From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let me share a bit more about the imaging program at RPI.\n\nMy main interests are in X-ray imaging and optical imaging. I direct our Biomedical Imaging Center, where we work on advancing these technologies. One exciting direction is how artificial intelligence can help improve imaging—making it faster, more accurate, and more insightful.\n\nThis work doesn’t happen in isolation. I collaborate with outstanding colleagues like Professor Xavier Intes, a leader in optical molecular tomography, Professor Pingkun Yan, a leader in AI-based image analysis and healthcare analytics, and many others. Together, we team up with world-class researchers from GE, Yale, Wake Forest, MGH, Stanford, FDA, and other top institutions. Our shared goal is to create imaging solutions that are innovative, influential, and that truly make differences in patient care.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
