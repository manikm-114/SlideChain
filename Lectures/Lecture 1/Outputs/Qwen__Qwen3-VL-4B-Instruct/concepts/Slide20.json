From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, for those of you considering a concentration in imaging—or even just taking this course seriously—it can really pay off in your career.\n\nMedical imaging is a technical field, but it’s also full of opportunities. If you understand how imaging systems work, and you can apply that knowledge to real-world problems, you’ll bring serious value to any team—whether in research, healthcare, or industry.\n\nAnd in case you’re still wondering: yes, biomedical engineering is a great profession. It sits at the intersection of life sciences, medicine, and engineering—and that makes it both exciting and employable.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Reject filler or administrative text.\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\n      \"term\": \"medical imaging is a technical field\",\n      \"category\": \"modality\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"if you understand how imaging systems work\",\n      \"category\": \"instrumentation\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"you can apply that knowledge to real-world problems\",\n      \"category\": \"data_processing\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"biomedical engineering is a great profession\",\n      \"category\": \"communication\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"it sits at the intersection of life sciences, medicine, and engineering\",\n      \"category\": \"communication\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\n    \"medical imaging is a technical field, but it’s also full of opportunities.\",\n    \"if you understand how imaging systems work, and you can apply that knowledge to real-world problems, you’ll bring serious value to any team—whether in research, healthcare, or industry.\",\n    \"biomedical engineering is a great profession.\",\n    \"it sits at the intersection of life sciences, medicine, and engineering—and that makes it both exciting and employable.\"\n  ]\n}",
