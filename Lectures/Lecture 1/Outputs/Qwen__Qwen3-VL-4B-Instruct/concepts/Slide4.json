From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s continue explaining our idea of medical imaging as a form of inner vision.\n\nYou know, as humans, our natural vision is powerful—but it’s limited. We can see the world around us, we can observe surfaces, recognize faces, navigate through our environment. But our vision is tied to visible light, and that means we can’t see through most objects. We don’t know what’s behind a wall, inside a box, or within our own bodies.\n\nThat’s where medical imaging comes in. It gives us the ability to look beyond the surface—to see inside the human body without making a single incision. This is what makes medical imaging so extraordinary. It extends our natural vision, allowing us to explore what’s hidden, to understand both the structure and function of our organs, and to help guide medical care.\n\nThink about it—when someone doesn’t feel well, when there’s discomfort or concern, what do we do? We turn to imaging. It becomes the eyes of the physician, revealing what’s happening beneath the surface. Through imaging, doctors can measure physiological function, detect disease, and ultimately provide treatment that can ease suffering or even save lives.\n\nThat’s the true power of medical imaging—and why we call it the inner vision of modern medicine.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
