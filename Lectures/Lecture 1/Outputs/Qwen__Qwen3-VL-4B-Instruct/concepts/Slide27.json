From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAnd what makes GE even more impressive is the global reach of their research.\n\nThey have major centers across the U.S., Europe, Asia, and South America. For example, the Global Research Center in Niskayuna, New York—right near RPI—is home to over a hundred labs and nearly two thousand technologists.\n\nFor a student interested in imaging, that’s a golden opportunity. You can collaborate, intern, or even launch a career through the GE-RPI partnership.\n\nSome of you may want to go into academia, others into entrepreneurship or industry. Wherever you go, connecting with innovation hubs like GE gives you a head start. Especially in imaging, they are a top-tier industrial partner.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
