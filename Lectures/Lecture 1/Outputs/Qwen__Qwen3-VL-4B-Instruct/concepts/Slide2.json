From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nWe’ll begin with the fundamentals — systems, Fourier analysis, signal processing — and hands-on MATLAB sessions. Then we’ll explore major imaging techniques: X-ray and radiography, CT, PET, SPECT, MRI, ultrasound, optical, and deep imaging. Along the way, we’ll have three exams to help you review and reinforce what you learn\n\n\nNow, just a quick note: in a traditional classroom, I’d mention office hours; however, since this is an online course, I encourage you to participate actively in our discussion forums. Don’t hesitate to post questions or thoughts as they come up. Learning is always more effective when it's interactive.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Reject filler or administrative text.\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\n      \"term\": \"systems\",\n      \"category\": \"signal_processing\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"Fourier analysis\",\n      \"category\": \"frequency_domain\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"signal processing\",\n      \"category\": \"signal_processing\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"MATLAB sessions\",\n      \"category\": \"software\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"X-ray and radiography\",\n      \"category\": \"modality\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"CT\",\n      \"category\": \"modality\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"PET\",\n      \"category\": \"modality\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"SPECT\",\n      \"category\": \"modality\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"MRI\",\n      \"category\": \"modality\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"ultrasound\",\n      \"category\": \"modality\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"optical imaging\",\n      \"category\": \"modality\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"deep imaging\",\n      \"category\": \"modality\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"three",
