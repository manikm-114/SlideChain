From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s zoom out to the global scale.\n\nMedical imaging isn’t just a field—it’s a major global industry. And it’s growing fast. Countries around the world are investing heavily in imaging infrastructure, service, and innovation.\n\nIf you look at the data, regions like Asia and Europe are rapidly expanding their market share. Asia, in particular, has seen a surge in R&D spending and adoption of advanced imaging technologies. That means more jobs, more research funding, and more innovation coming from across the globe.\n\nSo, whether you're aiming for industry, academia, or entrepreneurship—this is a great space to be in.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
