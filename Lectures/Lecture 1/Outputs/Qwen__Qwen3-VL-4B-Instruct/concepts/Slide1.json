From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHi everyone, and welcome to this online course on Medical Imaging. I’m Professor Ge Wang, and I’ll be guiding you through this exciting journey.\n\nMedical imaging is a fascinating and powerful field. It brings together science, engineering, and medicine to help us see what’s happening inside the human body—without making a single cut. Whether your background is in engineering, physics, computer science, or biology, you’ll find that medical imaging offers something valuable and fascinating.\n\nIn the weeks ahead, we’ll build a strong foundation in the core principles of imaging and describe a variety of technologies that are transforming modern healthcare. I'm excited to get started—and I hope you are too.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Reject filler or administrative text.\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\n      \"term\": \"medical imaging\",\n      \"category\": \"modality\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"science\",\n      \"category\": \"physics\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"engineering\",\n      \"category\": \"physics\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"medicine\",\n      \"category\": \"physics\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"see what’s happening inside the human body\",\n      \"category\": \"anatomy\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"without making a single cut\",\n      \"category\": \"anatomy\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"transforming modern healthcare\",\n      \"category\": \"modality\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\n    \"Medical imaging is a fascinating and powerful field.
