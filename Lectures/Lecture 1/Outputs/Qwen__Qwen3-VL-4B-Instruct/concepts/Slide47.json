From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, I want to say something that’s transforming the world of medical imaging: the huge wave of machine learning, artificial intelligence (AI), and robotics. These technologies hold huge potential, and they are revolutionizing how we analyze and interpret medical images, to say the least.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
