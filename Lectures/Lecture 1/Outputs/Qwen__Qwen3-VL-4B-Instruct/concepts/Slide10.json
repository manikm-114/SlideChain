From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo far, we've focused on X-rays—but medical imaging goes way beyond that. In fact, it covers almost the entire electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nDepending on what part of the spectrum you use, you get different kinds of information. For example:\n\nGamma rays are used in nuclear imaging, like PET and SPECT\n\nRadio waves are instrumental in MRI\n\nVisible and infrared light are for optical imaging\n\nAnd even ultrasound, though not part of the EM spectrum, gives us mechanical wave-based imaging, referred to as ultrasound imaging.\n\nEach imaging modality has its own strengths and weaknesses. Some are great for structure, others for function. Some are good at seeing bones, others at detecting molecular processes like metabolism or gene expression.\n\nIn fact, no single technique gives us the whole picture. That’s why modern medicine often combines them—what we call multimodal imaging. When we link them together, we get a rather rich view of what’s going on inside the body.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
