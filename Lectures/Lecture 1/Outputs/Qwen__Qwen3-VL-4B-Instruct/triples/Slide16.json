Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo by now, you might be thinking—this is all very cool, but why do I really need to learn medical imaging?\n\nWell, I’d say there are at least two solid reasons.\n\nFirst—and perhaps most importantly—it gives you essential health-related knowledge. Whether you pursue a career in engineering, medicine, or something entirely different, understanding how imaging works can help you make sense of your own health and the health of those around you, during your hospital visits and afterwards.\n\nThe second reason is career-related. We’ll get to that more. But for now, just keep in mind—this is cool knowledge for a niche group of people. It’s personal and extremely useful in several ways; to say the least, it is a required course for your college education.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"s\": \"Health-related Knowledge\",\n      \"p\": \"uses\",\n      \"o\": \"medical imaging\",\n      \"modalities\": [\"text\"],\n      \"confidence\": 0.95,\n      \"evidence\": \"it gives you essential health-related knowledge\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"s\": \"Career Requirements\",\n      \"p\": \"depends_on\",\n      \"o\": \"medical imaging\",\n      \"modalities\": [\"text\"],\n      \"confidence\": 0.95,\n      \"evidence\": \"It’s a required course for your college education\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
