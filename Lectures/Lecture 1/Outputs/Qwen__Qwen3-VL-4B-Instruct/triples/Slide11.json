Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s talk a bit more about what makes tomography special.\n\nWhen you take a regular photo with your phone, you get a picture—that’s it. It’s a direct result of what the camera sees. But tomographic imaging is different. You don’t directly capture the image you want. Instead, you collect data from many different angles, and that data is a kind of indirect measurement—a projection of what's inside.\n\nNow here’s the key part: to get a cross-sectional image, we need to do something called inversion. In other words, we take the measurements and reverse-engineer the internal structure that produced them.\n\nThis is an inverse problem. It’s different from the more familiar forward problem, where you know all the inputs, and a forward model, and calculate the outcome. Like in physics: you know the force and the mass, so you calculate how something moves.\n\nIn tomography, it’s the opposite. You see the outcome—the measurement—and you ask: what could have caused this? That’s a lot harder.\n\nHere’s a fun analogy: think of boiling an egg. That’s a straightforward process. But what if someone gave you a boiled egg and said, “Unboil it”? That’s the inverse problem. Sounds impossible—but researchers have found ways to reverse that process under specific conditions. It’s challenging, but not hopeless. And that’s what makes inversion in imaging both difficult and exciting.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
