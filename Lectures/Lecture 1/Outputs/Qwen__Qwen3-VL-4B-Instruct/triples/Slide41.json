Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, let's look at Ultrasound Imaging. While it might not be as widely discussed or as advanced as the big three—CT, nuclear imaging, and MRI—ultrasound remains a powerful, affordable, and safe imaging tool in medical practice, and seems playing an increasingly important role for point of care imaging.\n\nSo, how does ultrasound work? It operates based on the principle of mechanical vibrations. In ultrasound imaging, we use a device called a transducer, which contains piezoelectric materials. These materials can generate high-frequency sound waves when subjected to an electric current. These sound waves are then sent into the body.\n\nAs the sound waves travel through tissues, they interact with various structures inside the body. Some waves are reflected, and others continue through the tissues. The reflected waves are detected by the transducer, and from this data, we can reconstruct an image of the internal structures. Essentially, we’re mapping the body’s anatomy based on how sound waves bounce off tissues.\n\nOne of the greatest benefits of ultrasound is that it’s non-invasive and completely safe—unlike X-rays or CT scans, ultrasound doesn't involve ionizing radiation. It’s also incredibly cost-effective and high-speed, which makes it a go-to tool for many real-time imaging tasks. You’ll often see it used during fetal imaging in pregnancy, as well as in blood flow monitoring and guiding biopsies.\n\nWhile it may not provide the same level of detail as MRI or CT, ultrasound’s affordability, speed, and safety make it a valuable tool for many clinical applications. Coupled with AI methods, ultrasound imaging has yet more to offer.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
