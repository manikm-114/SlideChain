Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThese collaborations all come together in a fantastic building—the Center for Biotechnology and Interdisciplinary Studies, or CBIS.\n\nCBIS is more than just a building. It’s a hub where experts from biology, engineering, and computing come together to tackle big problems in science and healthcare. It’s where our imaging center is rooted, and where much of the work that I’ve been describing happens.\n\nOver the past decade, CBIS has been at the forefront of interdisciplinary research, and it continues to grow in both scope and impact.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"s\": \"The Center for Biotechnology & Interdisciplinary Studies at Rensselaer\",\n      \"p\": \"represents\",\n      \"o\": \"a hub where experts from biology, engineering, and computing come together to tackle big problems in science and healthcare\",\n      \"modalities\": [\n        \"text\"\n      ],\n      \"confidence\": 0.9,\n      \"evidence\": \"CBIS is more than just a building.
