Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s take a moment to appreciate just how interdisciplinary medical imaging really is.\n\nWe’re combining mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering—all in one field. Think about that. Whether we’re modeling how X-rays interact with tissue, analyzing ultrasound signals, or designing contrast agents for optical imaging—we’re pulling from all corners of science and technology.\n\nThis means that medical imaging isn’t just about one skill set. It’s about thinking broadly and connecting the dots between different fields. And if you enjoy solving complex problems, this is one of the best places to be.\n\nSo by now, you should have a pretty good sense of what this course is about—and what makes it so special. We’ll focus on modern biomedical imaging technologies, and we’ll build the knowledge and tools needed to understand how they work, and how they’re used to help people.\n\nAnd honestly, it’s really cool stuff.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
