Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo now that we’ve seen how vital CT, MRI, and other imaging technologies are in practice and in the global market—here’s something interesting to reflect on.\n\nA few years ago, a survey asked physicians and scientists to name the most important technological innovation of the entire 20th century. Think about that—this included everything: the internet, smartphones, even space travel.\n\nAnd what came out on top? Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Computed Tomography (CT). Not even close. These tomographic imaging technologies were voted number one by a considerable margin.\n\nWhy? Because they fundamentally changed how we diagnose and treat diseases. They let us see inside the human body in ways that were never possible before—accurately, noninvasively, and in real time.\n\nAs you go deeper into this course, you’ll learn how these systems work—so not only will you understand their value, you’ll also be able to explain it confidently in, say, a job interview or a professional conversation. That’s powerful knowledge.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
