Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nWe’ve designed this course with two major phases in mind: a foundation phase and a modality-specific phase. In the foundation phase—highlighted in light blue—you’ll build the critical background knowledge necessary to understand modern biomedical imaging systems. This includes essential concepts in linear systems, convolution, and Fourier analysis. These are the mathematical and conceptual tools at the heart of almost every imaging modality we’ll cover later.\n\nWhy this structure? Well, my previous experience with diverse students tells me that not everyone enters this course with the same preparation. Some of you may have strong backgrounds in physics, applied math, and electrical engineering—and that’s great. You might already be familiar with system theory and Fourier transform. But many others come from biology, chemistry, or material science backgrounds, where these topics are not emphasized. That’s completely okay.\n\nMedical imaging is interdisciplinary—and complex. So my job is to guide all of you, regardless of background, to the point where you understand these core ideas clearly and intuitively. It won't be enough to just listen and watch these lectures. You’ll need to invest time in previewing and reviewing the materials and doing the assignments. But rest assured—your effort will pay off. These foundational topics will resurface again and again, especially in modalities like CT and MRI, where the Fourier transform is a key player.\n\nAlso, linear systems might look simple on the surface—after all, they obey additivity and scaling rules—but they come with nuances. One particularly subtle concept is convolution, which plays a crucial role in both systems analysis and image reconstruction. We’ll make sure you understand not just how to compute it, but also why it matters and how it shows up in real-world scanners.\n\nSo, we begin with the foundation. Later, we’ll shift to the modality phase, shown in dark green—where we delve into imaging techniques like X-ray CT, nuclear imaging, MRI, ultrasound, and optical imaging. Each one has unique physics, engineering principles, and clinical applications.\n\nThink of it this way: the foundation is your universal imaging 'language'. Once you master it, learning each new modality becomes much easier, and far more meaningful.\n\nLet me walk you through our tentative timeline for the course—though as with any plan, we may make some adjustments along the way.\n\nThis lecture kicks off the course. In our next session, you’ll be introduced to MATLAB. If you're unfamiliar with it, don’t worry—our teaching assistant will help you get started. MATLAB is a vital tool in imaging research, especially when modeling systems or reconstructing images from tomographic data. After the introduction, you’ll have a short MATLAB-related assignment to sharpen your skills.\n\nThen we move into the foundation module—the light blue section. This is where we cover the theoretical concepts that apply across imaging technologies. After that, we transition to the green section—where we examine individual imaging modalities.\n\nYou’ll also be evaluated through three closed-book exams spaced across the course: one after the foundation module, one after the first set of modalities (CT and nuclear imaging), and one to cover everything else. Your final grade will be based on a combination of these exams, your homework, and participation.\n\nNow, this is an online course, so we’ve adapted all the content accordingly. Pre-recorded lectures, interactive demos, and exercises will all be made available. If you have questions, we encourage you to reach out via the discussion forum or email. Quick responses are part of our commitment to help you succeed.\n\nA quick tip: spend quality time understanding the Fourier transform early on. It’s a recurring theme. And if you’ve ever wondered why exponential functions like \n𝑒^𝑖𝜃 show up everywhere, this course will make that connection crystal clear. We’ll discuss how they lead to elegant mathematical representations and how these expressions play into image formation.\n\nFinally, one last point. This course is not just about passing exams—it’s about equipping you with a deep understanding that you can carry forward into research, engineering design, and healthcare work. Let’s work together and learn from each other.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
