Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAlright, so earlier we talked about how regular X-rays give us a flat, two-dimensional view of the body. But there’s a catch—everything in that path gets layered on top of each other. It’s like looking at shadows overlapped together.\n\nNow imagine if we could take many X-ray radiographs around the body—virtually, of course—and figure out what’s happening on transverse sections. That’s exactly what computed tomography, or CT, allows us to do.\n\nThe word \"tomography\" comes from Greek—\"tomos\" means slice, and \"graphy\" means writing or drawing. So, we're basically drawing slices of the body. With CT, we collect X-ray projections from many angles, then use a computer to reconstruct a cross-sectional image.\n\nThe result? A crystal-clear view of internal anatomy, without overlapping tissues. Today’s CT scanners are incredibly precise—some can even resolve features smaller than a millimeter. Think of it like slicing a watermelon and looking inside but doing it without a knife—just scanning. It’s an amazing tool, and one that has completely transformed modern medicine.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
