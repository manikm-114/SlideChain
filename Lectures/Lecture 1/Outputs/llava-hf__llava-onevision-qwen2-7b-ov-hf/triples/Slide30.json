Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let me share a bit more about the imaging program at RPI.\n\nMy main interests are in X-ray imaging and optical imaging. I direct our Biomedical Imaging Center, where we work on advancing these technologies. One exciting direction is how artificial intelligence can help improve imaging—making it faster, more accurate, and more insightful.\n\nThis work doesn’t happen in isolation. I collaborate with outstanding colleagues like Professor Xavier Intes, a leader in optical molecular tomography, Professor Pingkun Yan, a leader in AI-based image analysis and healthcare analytics, and many others. Together, we team up with world-class researchers from GE, Yale, Wake Forest, MGH, Stanford, FDA, and other top institutions. Our shared goal is to create imaging solutions that are innovative, influential, and that truly make differences in patient care.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"RPI\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"artificial intelligence\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"Making imaging faster, more accurate, and more insightful.\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
