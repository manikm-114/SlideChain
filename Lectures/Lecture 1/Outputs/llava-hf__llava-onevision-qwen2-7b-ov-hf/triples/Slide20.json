Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, for those of you considering a concentration in imaging—or even just taking this course seriously—it can really pay off in your career.\n\nMedical imaging is a technical field, but it’s also full of opportunities. If you understand how imaging systems work, and you can apply that knowledge to real-world problems, you’ll bring serious value to any team—whether in research, healthcare, or industry.\n\nAnd in case you’re still wondering: yes, biomedical engineering is a great profession. It sits at the intersection of life sciences, medicine, and engineering—and that makes it both exciting and employable.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"medical imaging\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"technical field\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"Medical imaging is a technical field, but it’s also full of opportunities.\"}\n  ]\n}",
