Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHi everyone, and welcome to this online course on Medical Imaging. I’m Professor Ge Wang, and I’ll be guiding you through this exciting journey.\n\nMedical imaging is a fascinating and powerful field. It brings together science, engineering, and medicine to help us see what’s happening inside the human body—without making a single cut. Whether your background is in engineering, physics, computer science, or biology, you’ll find that medical imaging offers something valuable and fascinating.\n\nIn the weeks ahead, we’ll build a strong foundation in the core principles of imaging and describe a variety of technologies that are transforming modern healthcare. I'm excited to get started—and I hope you are too.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"medical imaging\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"science, engineering, and medicine\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"It brings together science, engineering, and medicine to help us see what’s happening inside the human body—without making a single cut.\"}\n  ]\n}",
