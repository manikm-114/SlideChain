  "raw_output": "user \nSystem:\nYou are extracting factual relations from a medical imaging lecture. Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s zoom out for a moment and look at biomedical engineering as a field.\n\nIt’s one of the newest branches of engineering. Engineering started with disciplines like civil and mechanical, then moved into electrical, chemical, and aerospace. More recently, biomedical engineering emerged to bridge the gap between technology and medicine.\n\nAnd it’s grown fast—because it’s relevant, it’s interdisciplinary, and it’s impactful.\n\nIn many universities, biomedical engineering includes at least two major focus areas. One is imaging, which is what we’re covering here. The other is tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, often called TERM.\n\nWhether or not you plan to specialize in imaging, this course plays a foundational role. It builds your technical knowledge, strengthens your systems thinking, and helps you understand one of the most important technologies in healthcare today.\n\nSo if you’re here as part of your degree requirements—great. But don’t just treat it like a checkbox. Learn it well. It will pay off, academically, professionally, and personally.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"biomedical engineering\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"medical imaging\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"It’s one of the newest branches of engineering.
