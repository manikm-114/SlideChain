Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet me share something personal with you.\n\nA couple of years ago, I had a kidney stone. Not fun. I ended up in the hospital, they injected a contrast agent, ran a CT scan, and just like that—they could see the size and location of the stone.\n\nNow, because I understood what was going on, I wasn’t worried or confused. I could follow the diagnosis, and I knew what the doctors were looking for.\n\nAnd honestly, sooner or later, most of us will have a medical scan—whether it’s an X-ray, a CT, or an MRI. And perhaps, all of them and multiple times. It could be you, or someone you love. When that happens, wouldn’t it be helpful to understand what those images mean?\n\nThat’s why this knowledge matters—not just in theory, but in real life.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"medical imaging\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"contrast agent\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"Injection of a contrast agent\"}\n  ]\n}",
