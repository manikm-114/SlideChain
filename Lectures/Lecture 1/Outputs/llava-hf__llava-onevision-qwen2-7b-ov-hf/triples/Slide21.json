Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nIn fact, if you look at trends in job growth, biomedical engineering consistently ranks among the fastest-growing careers. Just take a glance at some recent employment reports—you’ll see biomedical engineers right near the top.\n\nWhy is that? Well, part of the reason is that healthcare is becoming more tech-driven. Devices, sensors, data analysis, machine learning—it all depends on people who can bridge the gap between biology and engineering.\n\nSo not only is this field intellectually exciting—it also comes with strong job prospects and competitive salaries.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"biomedical engineering\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"fastest-growing careers\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"biomedical engineers consistently ranks among the fastest-growing careers\"}\n  ]\n}",
