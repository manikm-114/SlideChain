Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAs we continue our journey into medical imaging, let me take a moment to introduce myself in a little more depth.\n\nI’m Professor Ge Wang, and in addition to teaching this course, I’m deeply involved in research on medical imaging. My work spans both the theoretical and applied sides of the field. I’ve dedicated much of my career to advancing medical imaging science so that we can better diagnose and treat disease.\n\nIf you’re interested in exploring more about my work, feel free to check out my home page and lab’s website, where we share updates on our latest projects.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"Professor Ge Wang\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"medical imaging\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"As we continue our journey into medical imaging, let me take a moment to introduce myself in a little more depth.\"}\n  ]\n}",
