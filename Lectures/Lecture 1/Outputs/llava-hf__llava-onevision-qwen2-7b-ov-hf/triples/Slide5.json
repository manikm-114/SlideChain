Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet me ask you this—what if we could see through the human body, almost like having X-ray vision? Imagine being able to look at tissues, organs, even down to the cellular level. Sounds like science fiction, right?\n\nWell, that’s exactly the dream of medical imaging. This field gives us a kind of \"super vision\"—an inner vision—that lets us explore the human body from the inside out, completely noninvasively.\n\nAnd the truth is, what once seemed futuristic is now part of everyday medical practice. With the tools we’ll talk about in this course, clinicians can detect problems earlier, treat patients more precisely, and monitor progress more closely. Many of the advances in imaging came from the needs that once seemed impossible—until technology caught up. You’ll see how these breakthroughs happened, and why they matter.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"medical imaging\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"X-ray vision\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"Let me ask you this—what if we could see through the human body, almost like having X-ray vision?
