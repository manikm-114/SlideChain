Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLooking ahead, many of you will have families of your own. When a family member gets a scan or a test result, wouldn’t you want to understand what’s happening?\n\nThat’s where this course really empowers you.\n\nEven if you don’t go into imaging research, even if you don’t become a radiologist or an imaging scientist, just being able to interpret results and ask the right questions can make a big difference.\n\nSo that’s the first reason: personal and practical value. Now let’s move on to the second one—your career.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"family member\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"scan or a test result\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"When a family member gets a scan or a test result, wouldn’t you want to understand what’s happening?\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
