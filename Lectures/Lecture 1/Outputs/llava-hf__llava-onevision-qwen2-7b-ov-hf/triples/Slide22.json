Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s zoom out to the global scale.\n\nMedical imaging isn’t just a field—it’s a major global industry. And it’s growing fast. Countries around the world are investing heavily in imaging infrastructure, service, and innovation.\n\nIf you look at the data, regions like Asia and Europe are rapidly expanding their market share. Asia, in particular, has seen a surge in R&D spending and adoption of advanced imaging technologies. That means more jobs, more research funding, and more innovation coming from across the globe.\n\nSo, whether you're aiming for industry, academia, or entrepreneurship—this is a great space to be in.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1].
