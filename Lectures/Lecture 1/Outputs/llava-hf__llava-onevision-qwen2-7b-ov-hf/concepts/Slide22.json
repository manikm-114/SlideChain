From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s zoom out to the global scale.\n\nMedical imaging isn’t just a field—it’s a major global industry. And it’s growing fast. Countries around the world are investing heavily in imaging infrastructure, service, and innovation.\n\nIf you look at the data, regions like Asia and Europe are rapidly expanding their market share. Asia, in particular, has seen a surge in R&D spending and adoption of advanced imaging technologies. That means more jobs, more research funding, and more innovation coming from across the globe.\n\nSo, whether you're aiming for industry, academia, or entrepreneurship—this is a great space to be in.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"medical imaging\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"global industry\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"R&D spending\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"advanced imaging technologies\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"more jobs, more research funding, and more innovation\", \"category\": \"communication\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"Countries around the world are investing heavily in imaging infrastructure, service, and innovation.\", \"Asia, in particular, has seen a surge in R&D spending and adoption of advanced imaging technologies.\"]\n}\n```",
