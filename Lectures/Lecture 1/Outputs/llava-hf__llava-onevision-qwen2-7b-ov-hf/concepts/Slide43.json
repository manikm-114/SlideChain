From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow that we’ve explored the different imaging modalities and how they allow us to visualize features inside the body, the next logical step is to talk about what we can do with the images we’ve acquired. Once you have an image, you don’t just look at it—you analyze it to gain task-specific information. This is where the domain of image processing grows.\n\nIn medicine, image analysis is crucial for extracting actionable insights. There are various techniques we use, such as image segmentation, where we identify specific regions or structures within the image—like tumors, organs, or blood vessels. By doing this, we can focus on areas of interest, making it easier to understand what’s happening inside the body.\n\nAnother important tool is image classification, which allows us to categorize different structures or tissues based on their visual features. This helps doctors make diagnosis, track changes over time, or even guide interventional procedures. \n\nWe also use techniques like image enhancement, which improves the quality of the image by making certain features more visible, such as image deblurring, which sharpens images that might have been blurry due to motion or technical issues.\n\nSome textbooks on medical imaging even include image visualization. This is where new technologies like augmented reality (AR) become relevant. I recently read an article, where the use of AR is discussed for medical imaging-guided surgery. With this innovative method, surgeons wear specialized glasses that overlay imaging data directly onto the patient’s body during surgery, guiding their actions in real time. While this is an exciting application of medical imaging, for the scope of this course, we’ll focus more on bio-imaging and bio-instrumentation, with an emphasis on tomographic imaging.\n\nIn this course, we’ll briefly cover some key aspects of image analysis, but we won’t delve too deeply into every aspect of processing. By the end, you’ll have a solid understanding of how image analysis ties into the broader field of medical imaging.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
