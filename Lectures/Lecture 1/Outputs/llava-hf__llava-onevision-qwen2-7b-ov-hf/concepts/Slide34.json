From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nFor the modality-specific portion of the course—the dark green section—we’ll be using the green textbook: Introduction to Biomedical Imaging by Andrew Webb. It’s available online or through our university bookstore.\n\nThis book isn’t very thick, but it’s well-structured and written with clarity. Even though it was published a while ago, the fundamental principles it covers haven’t changed. Physics is timeless in that way. We’ll supplement the book with more recent findings, particularly in areas like deep learning for image reconstruction, low-dose imaging, and multi-modal fusion—advances that have significantly shaped the field over past several years.\n\nThe textbook will guide your learning, especially in the second part of the course. For the foundation topics like linear systems and Fourier theory, we’ll use tailored lecture notes and curated readings, because unfortunately, there’s no single book that explains everything in a concise and consistent manner for students from all backgrounds.\n\nSo, keep this in mind: while you may rely on the textbook for the modality section, the theoretical part of the course will require close attention to lecture materials and exercises. That’s where most students need the extra help—and that’s why we’re here to support you.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
