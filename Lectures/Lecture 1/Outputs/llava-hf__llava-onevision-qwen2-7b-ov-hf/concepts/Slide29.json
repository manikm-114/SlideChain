From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAs we continue our journey into medical imaging, let me take a moment to introduce myself in a little more depth.\n\nI’m Professor Ge Wang, and in addition to teaching this course, I’m deeply involved in research on medical imaging. My work spans both the theoretical and applied sides of the field. I’ve dedicated much of my career to advancing medical imaging science so that we can better diagnose and treat disease.\n\nIf you’re interested in exploring more about my work, feel free to check out my home page and lab’s website, where we share updates on our latest projects.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"medical imaging\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"research\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"diagnose\", \"category\": \"anatomy\"},\n    {\"term\": \"treat\", \"category\": \"anatomy\"},\n    {\"term\": \"medical imaging science\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"advancing\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"dedicated\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"career\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"work\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"projects\", \"category\": \"software\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"...my work spans both the theoretical and applied sides of the field.\", \"I’ve dedicated much of my career to advancing medical imaging science so that we can better diagnose and treat disease.\"]\n}\n```",
