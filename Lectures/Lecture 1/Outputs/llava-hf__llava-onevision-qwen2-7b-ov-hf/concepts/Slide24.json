From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo now that we’ve seen how vital CT, MRI, and other imaging technologies are in practice and in the global market—here’s something interesting to reflect on.\n\nA few years ago, a survey asked physicians and scientists to name the most important technological innovation of the entire 20th century. Think about that—this included everything: the internet, smartphones, even space travel.\n\nAnd what came out on top? Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Computed Tomography (CT). Not even close. These tomographic imaging technologies were voted number one by a considerable margin.\n\nWhy? Because they fundamentally changed how we diagnose and treat diseases. They let us see inside the human body in ways that were never possible before—accurately, noninvasively, and in real time.\n\nAs you go deeper into this course, you’ll learn how these systems work—so not only will you understand their value, you’ll also be able to explain it confidently in, say, a job interview or a professional conversation. That’s powerful knowledge.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"Computed Tomography (CT)\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"diagnose and treat diseases\", \"category\": \"anatomy\"},\n    {\"term\": \"noninvasive\", \"category\": \"workflow\"},\n    {\"term\": \"accurately, noninvasively, and in real time\", \"category\": \"workflow\"},\n    {\"term\": \"explain it confidently\", \"category\": \"communication\"},\n    {\"term\": \"job interview or a professional conversation\", \"category\": \"communication\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"MRI and CT were voted number one by a considerable margin.\", \"These tomographic imaging technologies were voted number one by a considerable margin.\", \"They fundamentally changed how we diagnose and treat diseases.\", \"You’ll learn how these systems work—so not only will you understand their value, you’ll also be able to explain it confidently in, say, a job interview or a professional conversation.\"]\n}\n```",
