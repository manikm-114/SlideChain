From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAnd what makes GE even more impressive is the global reach of their research.\n\nThey have major centers across the U.S., Europe, Asia, and South America. For example, the Global Research Center in Niskayuna, New York—right near RPI—is home to over a hundred labs and nearly two thousand technologists.\n\nFor a student interested in imaging, that’s a golden opportunity. You can collaborate, intern, or even launch a career through the GE-RPI partnership.\n\nSome of you may want to go into academia, others into entrepreneurship or industry. Wherever you go, connecting with innovation hubs like GE gives you a head start. Especially in imaging, they are a top-tier industrial partner.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"GE\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"research\", \"category\": \"workflow\"},\n    {\"term\": \"centers\", \"category\": \"workflow\"},\n    {\"term\": \"laboratories\", \"category\": \"workflow\"},\n    {\"term\": \"technologists\", \"category\": \"workflow\"},\n    {\"term\": \"collaborate\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"intern\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"launch\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"academia\", \"category\": \"anatomy\"},\n    {\"term\": \"entrepreneurship\", \"category\": \"anatomy\"},\n    {\"term\": \"industry\", \"category\": \"anatomy\"},\n    {\"term\": \"innovation hubs\", \"category\": \"communication\"},\n    {\"term\": \"head start\", \"category\": \"communication\"},\n    {\"term\": \"industrial partner\", \"category\": \"communication\"},\n    {\"term\": \"top-tier\", \"category\": \"communication\"},\n    {\"term\": \"imaging\", \"category\": \"physics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"connect\", \"category\": \"communication\"},\n    {\"term\": \"golden",
