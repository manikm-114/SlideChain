From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet me ask you this—what if we could see through the human body, almost like having X-ray vision? Imagine being able to look at tissues, organs, even down to the cellular level. Sounds like science fiction, right?\n\nWell, that’s exactly the dream of medical imaging. This field gives us a kind of \"super vision\"—an inner vision—that lets us explore the human body from the inside out, completely noninvasively.\n\nAnd the truth is, what once seemed futuristic is now part of everyday medical practice. With the tools we’ll talk about in this course, clinicians can detect problems earlier, treat patients more precisely, and monitor progress more closely. Many of the advances in imaging came from the needs that once seemed impossible—until technology caught up. You’ll see how these breakthroughs happened, and why they matter.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"medical imaging\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"X-ray vision\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"noninvasive\", \"category\": \"workflow\"},\n    {\"term\": \"detect problems earlier\", \"category\": \"quality_metric\"},\n    {\"term\": \"treat patients more precisely\", \"category\": \"reconstruction\"},\n    {\"term\": \"monitor progress more closely\", \"category\": \"data_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"breakthroughs\", \"category\": \"physics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"impossible\", \"category\": \"communication\"},\n    {\"term\": \"impossible\", \"category\": \"anatomy\"},\n    {\"term\": \"impossible\", \"category\": \"algorithm\"},\n    {\"term\": \"impossible\", \"category\": \"ai_ml\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"This field gives us a kind of 'super vision'—an inner vision—that lets us explore the human body from the inside out, completely noninvasively.\", \"With the tools we’ll talk about in this course, clinicians can detect problems earlier, treat patients more precisely, and monitor progress more closely.\", \"Many of the advances in imaging",
