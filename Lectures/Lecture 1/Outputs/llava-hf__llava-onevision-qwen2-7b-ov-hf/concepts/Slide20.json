From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, for those of you considering a concentration in imaging—or even just taking this course seriously—it can really pay off in your career.\n\nMedical imaging is a technical field, but it’s also full of opportunities. If you understand how imaging systems work, and you can apply that knowledge to real-world problems, you’ll bring serious value to any team—whether in research, healthcare, or industry.\n\nAnd in case you’re still wondering: yes, biomedical engineering is a great profession. It sits at the intersection of life sciences, medicine, and engineering—and that makes it both exciting and employable.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"medical imaging\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"biomedical engineering\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"technical field\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"real-world problems\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"value\", \"category\": \"quality_metric\"},\n    {\"term\": \"life sciences\", \"category\": \"physics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"medicine\", \"category\": \"physics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"engineering\", \"category\": \"physics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"exciting\", \"category\": \"communication\"},\n    {\"term\": \"employable\", \"category\": \"communication\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"Now, for those of you considering a concentration in imaging—or even just taking this course seriously—it can really pay off in your career.\", \"Medical imaging is a technical field, but it’s also full of opportunities.
