From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThese collaborations all come together in a fantastic building—the Center for Biotechnology and Interdisciplinary Studies, or CBIS.\n\nCBIS is more than just a building. It’s a hub where experts from biology, engineering, and computing come together to tackle big problems in science and healthcare. It’s where our imaging center is rooted, and where much of the work that I’ve been describing happens.\n\nOver the past decade, CBIS has been at the forefront of interdisciplinary research, and it continues to grow in both scope and impact.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"interdisciplinary\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"imaging center\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"big problems\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"interdisciplinary research\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"CBIS\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"hub\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"biology, engineering, and computing\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"big problems in science and healthcare\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"work that I’ve been describing\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"past decade\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"interdisciplinary\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"growing in both scope and impact\", \"category\": \"software\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"It’s where our imaging center is rooted, and where much of the work that I’ve been describing happens.\", \"CBIS is more than just a building.
