From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo, to kick things off, let me give you a quick overview of what we’ll cover today.\n\nThere are four main questions we’ll explore:\n\nFirst, what is medical imaging?\n\nSecond, why should we study it?\n\nThird, who are involved in this course?\n\nAnd finally, how are we going to approach the material?\n\nNow, when we talk about medical imaging—sometimes we use the terms biomedical imaging or bio-instrumentation—we’re referring to a wide range of methods, technologies and systems that help us see inside the human body, animals, or biological samples. These methods are grounded in engineering, physics, and biomedicine.\n\nAnd this isn’t just about theory. You’ll also get hands-on experience with tools like MATLAB, and you’ll work with selected reading materials and online resources. By the end of the course, you’ll not only understand how these imaging systems work but also be able to apply that knowledge in a meaningful way.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"medical imaging\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"biomedical imaging\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"bio-instrumentation\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"MATLAB\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"hands-on experience\", \"category\": \"workflow\"},\n    {\"term\": \"tools\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"selected reading materials\", \"category\": \"workflow\"},\n    {\"term\": \"online resources\", \"category\": \"workflow\"},\n    {\"term\": \"theories\", \"category\": \"physics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"engineering\", \"category\": \"physics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"physics\", \"category\": \"physics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"biomedicine\", \"category\": \"physics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"applying knowledge\", \"category\": \"workflow\"},\n    {\"term\": \"meaningful way\", \"category\": \"workflow\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"You'll also get hands-on experience with tools like MATLAB, and you'll work with selected reading materials and online resources.
