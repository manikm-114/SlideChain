From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, within GE, one of the most important innovation engines is their Global Research Center. This is where long-term, high-impact R&D happens.\n\nTheir record speaks for itself—two Nobel Prizes, major contributions to physics, chemistry, materials, energy, and of course, medical imaging.\n\nIn 1984, they played a critical role in the development of MRI systems. And in 1999, digital X-ray systems came out of their labs. They’ve consistently been at the forefront of translating ideas into real-world technologies. My lab and Global Research Center has been closely collaborating on medical imaging over decades. \n\nSo when we say medical imaging sits at the cutting edge of innovation—we mean it.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"MRI systems\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"digital X-ray systems\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"Global Research Center\", \"category\": \"workflow\"},\n    {\"term\": \"Nobel Prizes\", \"category\": \"physics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"medical imaging\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"innovation\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"R&D\", \"category\": \"workflow\"},\n    {\"term\": \"long-term\", \"category\": \"workflow\"},\n    {\"term\": \"high-impact\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"two Nobel Prizes\", \"category\": \"physics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"major contributions to physics, chemistry, materials, energy\", \"category\": \"physics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"medical imaging\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"cutting edge of innovation\", \"category\": \"software\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"This is where long-term, high-impact R&D happens.\", \"GE played a critical role in the development of MRI systems.\", \"And in 199",
