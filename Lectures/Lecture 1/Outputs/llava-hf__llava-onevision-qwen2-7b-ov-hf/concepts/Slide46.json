From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nYou’ll notice that this course is not just about the theory—it’s also about putting those theories into practice. For example, you can use MATLAB to simulate various types of data processing. It’s not about learning complicated tricks; it’s about using basic MATLAB functions to analyze data, visualize results, and perform tasks that will help with your assignments.\n\nRemember, the goal here is not to get bogged down in fancy techniques. Rather, we want to ensure that you have a solid foundation in MATLAB so that when it’s time to do your homework or apply concepts like the Fourier transform or linear systems, you’ll have the tool you need to execute them effectively. Now, ChatGPT is a great tool to help you develop MatLab codes.  Please keep this in mind and become familiar with ChatGPT in this context.\n\nWith hands-on practice, you'll get familiar with the interface and the functionality, making your learning process or workflow more effective and more efficient. It’s all about building that confidence through practical experience.\n\nSo, let’s keep learning with MATLAB. By engaging with it now, you’ll set yourself up for success in the course.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"MATLAB\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"data processing\", \"category\": \"data_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"practical experience\", \"category\": \"workflow\"},\n    {\"term\": \"confidence\", \"category\": \"workflow\"},\n    {\"term\": \"success\", \"category\": \"workflow\"},\n    {\"term\": \"confidence\", \"category\": \"workflow\"},\n    {\"term\": \"practical experience\", \"category\": \"workflow\"},\n    {\"term\": \"MATLAB\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"ChatGPT\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"confidence\", \"category\": \"workflow\"},\n    {\"term\": \"practical experience\", \"category\": \"workflow\"},\n    {\"term\": \"success\", \"category\": \"workflow\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"You’ll notice that this course is not just about the theory—it’s also about putting those theories into practice.\", \"For example, you can use MATLAB to simulate various types of data processing.\", \"Remember, the goal here is not to get bogged down in fancy techniques.\", \"Rather, we want to ensure that you have a solid foundation in MATLAB",
