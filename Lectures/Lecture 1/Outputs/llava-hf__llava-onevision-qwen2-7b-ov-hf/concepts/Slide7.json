From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nFast forward to today, and X-ray imaging—specifically X-ray radiography—is one of the most common tools used in hospitals and clinics around the world. It’s fast, affordable, and incredibly useful.\n\nLet’s say someone falls and hurts their arm. An X-ray can quickly show whether there's a fracture. Or in breast cancer screening, mammography—a specialized type of X-ray radiography—can reveal tiny calcifications or early tumors that might not be detectable by touch. Early detection like this can save lives.\n\nBut there’s a limitation with X-ray radiographs. They’re 2D projections, so everything in the body along the X-ray path gets stacked into one image. That makes it hard to see soft tissues clearly or to isolate specific structures.\n\nSo, the next logical step was to ask—what if we could look from multiple directions and reconstruct a full 3D view of what’s inside? That question led to the development of Computed Tomography, or CT, which we’ll get into next.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
