When it comes to imaging modalities, CT and MRI continue to lead in market share and clinical use.

That’s no surprise—both are incredibly versatile and widely used across medical specialties. CT scans are fast and great for detailed anatomical views. MRI provides outstanding soft tissue contrast, which is essential in areas like cardiology and neurology.

You might be surprised, though, that nuclear imaging—like PET and SPECT—is also a major player. These techniques are critical for functional imaging and cancer imaging. They are becoming more popular as we move toward personalized and molecular medicine.

Each year, investment in these technologies grows. The message is clear: the field is fast evolving, and there’s a strong momentum behind it.
