Continuing with our exploration of imaging modalities, let’s now discuss Positron Emission Tomography, or PET. While the previous imaging techniques focused on capturing the anatomical structure, PET offers a powerful way to visualize the functional activity in the human body.

So, how does it work? Well, the key to PET is the introduction of radioactive tracers into the body. These tracers are typically radioactive chemicals that participate in your body’s metabolic processes. For example, tumors tend to consume a lot of glucose. If we couple glucose molecules with a radioactive tracer, we can track how much glucose the tumor is using, which directly correlates with its activity. Tumors, which are often highly metabolic, will naturally absorb more of this tracer.

Once the PET tracer is in the body, it begins to emit gamma ray photons in pairs, and two photons in a pair will travel in opposite directions. Gamma rays, much like X-rays, can penetrate through tissues and be detected externally. When we receive gamma ray photons from two different detector locations, we know they originated from the same event somewhere on the line connecting the two detectors.
This process is similar to the measurement of line integrals used for CT. Then, we can apply Fourier analysis to reconstruct the images. In PET, Fourier transforms help us create detailed, functional images of the body’s processes. The goal here is to understand how much activities are happening at specific locations. So, while we’ve seen how CT gives us anatomical details, PET allows us to observe the biological functions—like metabolism—within those structures.

This modality is especially useful for identifying cancerous tissues, studying brain function, and even monitoring heart conditions. Later, we’ll explain how the gamma ray photons are detected and processed to reconstruct these functional images. But for now, remember that PET imaging provides us with a way to look inside the body not just for its structure, but also for how physiology is actively working.
