These collaborations all come together in a fantastic building—the Center for Biotechnology and Interdisciplinary Studies, or CBIS.

CBIS is more than just a building. It’s a hub where experts from biology, engineering, and computing come together to tackle big problems in science and healthcare. It’s where our imaging center is rooted, and where much of the work that I’ve been describing happens.

Over the past decade, CBIS has been at the forefront of interdisciplinary research, and it continues to grow in both scope and impact.
