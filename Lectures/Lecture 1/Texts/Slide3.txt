So, to kick things off, let me give you a quick overview of what we’ll cover today.

There are four main questions we’ll explore:

First, what is medical imaging?

Second, why should we study it?

Third, who are involved in this course?

And finally, how are we going to approach the material?

Now, when we talk about medical imaging—sometimes we use the terms biomedical imaging or bio-instrumentation—we’re referring to a wide range of methods, technologies and systems that help us see inside the human body, animals, or biological samples. These methods are grounded in engineering, physics, and biomedicine.

And this isn’t just about theory. You’ll also get hands-on experience with tools like MATLAB, and you’ll work with selected reading materials and online resources. By the end of the course, you’ll not only understand how these imaging systems work but also be able to apply that knowledge in a meaningful way.
