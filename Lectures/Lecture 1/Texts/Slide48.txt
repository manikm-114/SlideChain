As we continue to explore the exciting advancements in medical imaging, it's clear that this field is still young. Through a recent survey, I found that medical imaging is one of the hottest areas in research today, with a significant increase in the number of published papers every year. However, what’s really catching attention is machine learning—it's quickly becoming an even hotter topic than medical imaging itself.

What does this mean? The combination of medical imaging with machine learning, especially deep learning, holds enormous potential for the future of diagnostics, treatment planning, and personalized medicine. This intersection is where we can expect to see transformative changes in how we approach medical imaging. The ability to reconstruct, analyze and interpret medical images with AI-empowered algorithms opens doors to endless possibilities.

In 2016 I wrote the first perspective article titled Perspective on Deep Imaging, where I share my thoughts on how deep learning and AI are poised to revolutionize medical imaging in the coming years. If you’re curious about my views on this, feel free to search for it and dive deeper into the future of medical imaging.

However, in this course, we’re going to stick with the traditional classroom teaching, but for those of you who are highly motivated and eager to push beyond the syllabus, there’s an exciting option. You can choose to work on a project that integrates machine learning with medical imaging. This would involve hands-on research, where your work could contribute directly to a meaningful outcome in the field.

While it’s not a requirement, this is an opportunity for those of you who want to challenge yourselves and explore advanced concepts further. For students who choose this option, 30% of your grade could come from the research project, with 70% from other course elements. Many students find that they don’t have the time to take such a project, but if you’re passionate about it, the opportunity is there. In fact, some of my former students, even high school students, have worked with me on research projects, and have gone on to get their work published in conferences and journals, which can be a huge boost to their career.

So, if you feel like the course is a bit easy and you’re ready to go beyond, this project option could be a perfect fit. The office door is always open, and if you choose this path, you'll get real-world experience and potentially contribute to cutting-edge research.
