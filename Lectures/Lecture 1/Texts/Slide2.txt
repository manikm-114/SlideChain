We’ll begin with the fundamentals — systems, Fourier analysis, signal processing — and hands-on MATLAB sessions. Then we’ll explore major imaging techniques: X-ray and radiography, CT, PET, SPECT, MRI, ultrasound, optical, and deep imaging. Along the way, we’ll have three exams to help you review and reinforce what you learn


Now, just a quick note: in a traditional classroom, I’d mention office hours; however, since this is an online course, I encourage you to participate actively in our discussion forums. Don’t hesitate to post questions or thoughts as they come up. Learning is always more effective when it's interactive.
