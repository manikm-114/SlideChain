Now, I often like to say: if CBIS were a coordinate system, my office would be right at the origin!

Of course, for this online course, we’re not meeting in person. But the idea is the same—I’m here as a resource for you. The lectures, materials, and any additional resources I share are all designed to help you succeed and make the most of this learning experience.
