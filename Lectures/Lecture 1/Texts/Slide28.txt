Before we wrap up this introduction,  I’ll also give you a simple task—just a brief introductory slide you can prepare. It’s not graded, but it helps me get a sense of who you are, what your background is, your GPA, research experience, and what you hope to learn. That way, I can adjust the flow of this course to better support your journey.
