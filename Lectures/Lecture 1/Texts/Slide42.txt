Now, let’s talk about Optical Imaging, another fascinating imaging modality that uses visible and infrared light. Unlike the other imaging techniques we've discussed, optical imaging focuses on how light interacts with cells, allowing us to reveal molecular and cellular interactions in the body.

One unique aspect of optical imaging is its ability to extract signatures from these biological interactions, providing valuable information about what’s happening at a microscopic level. This is where things get exciting! For example, we can use luminescence probes to tag specific proteins or gene expressions. Once tagged, these proteins will emit a luminescent light and make them visible to our imaging system.

Think of it like the glow of a firefly in a summer night. When certain proteins or cells are tagged, they emit bioluminescent light, which we can detect. This is a form of passive imaging, meaning the light we need to detect is emitted by the body itself, rather than steered by any external light source.

For example, in a typical experiment, an animal might be placed in a dark room, and we would observe the light emissions coming from specific areas on its body. We want to perform tomographic reconstruction to find the internal distribution of the bioluminescent sources. For that purpose, we combine an optical imager with a separate tomographic scanner, which helps us get both the anatomy and the optical properties of organs and structures to build a forward imaging model. After that, we can invert this forward model for reconstruction of a 3D distribution of bioluminescent sources.

The real challenge in optical imaging isn’t in the forward process—where we predict the external signal based on the known internal structures. The difficulty is in the inverse process, where we have this inverse problem: Given the external light signals we measure, how do we reconstruct the distribution of bioluminescent sources inside the body?

To do this, we use multiple mirrors to collect all the emitted light, creating a complete set of external views. We then use this data to reconstruct the internal light source distribution. This method has been known as bioluminescence tomography that we pioneered and has become quite popular in the literature.

Note that optical imaging includes a good number of techniques.  Bioluminescence tomography is only one of them. We have fluorescence tomography as well, with fluorescence probes excitable by an external laser source. More clinically important is optical coherence tomography or OCT, which is used to check your retina in eye clinic.

In summary, optical imaging, like other modalities, allows us to visualize and understand structures, probes or tracers inside the body. It’s a unique and powerful way to study biology from the inside out.
