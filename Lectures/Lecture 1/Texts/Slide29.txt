As we continue our journey into medical imaging, let me take a moment to introduce myself in a little more depth.

I’m Professor Ge Wang, and in addition to teaching this course, I’m deeply involved in research on medical imaging. My work spans both the theoretical and applied sides of the field. I’ve dedicated much of my career to advancing medical imaging science so that we can better diagnose and treat disease.

If you’re interested in exploring more about my work, feel free to check out my home page and lab’s website, where we share updates on our latest projects.
