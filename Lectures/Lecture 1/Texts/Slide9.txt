Now, if you want to get a fun and visual explanation of how X-rays work, there’s a great animated video I did for TED-Ed. It’s called “How X-rays See Through Your Skin.”

In just a few minutes, it walks you through how X-rays are produced, how they interact with the body, and how detected signals are turned into a cross-sectional image. It’s a great refresher, especially if you’re a visual learner.

You’ll also see how this technology became the foundation for other types of imaging we’ll cover—like PET, SPECT, and MRI. The video’s optional, but I really recommend checking it out when you have a moment.
