Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s now talk about Time-of-Flight Imaging, or TOF, which is a fundamental technique in Magnetic Resonance Angiography, or MRA. In a standard CT image, blood vessels and soft tissues often appear very similar in density. As a result, it’s difficult to distinguish the vasculature — you can’t easily tell whether a vessel is open, narrowed, or completely blocked. To solve this problem in CT, we use a contrast agent — typically iodine — a liquid metal with a very high linear attenuation coefficient. When injected into the bloodstream, iodine increases the attenuation of X-rays in the blood, making vessels appear much brighter than the surrounding soft tissue. If a vessel that should be wide suddenly appears narrow or faint in the CT image, that suggests a vascular blockage, which could require stenting or further cardiac intervention. This is the basic principle behind CT angiography.\n\nNow, for MRI angiography, the principle is different, but the goal is the same — to make the blood vessels appear distinct from the surrounding tissue. Here’s how it works: we first select a single imaging slice, and then apply a radio-frequency pulse, typically using an echo-planar imaging sequence, to flip the spins — those small magnetic dipoles — within that slice. At that instant, both the blood within the vessel and the stationary tissue generate signals that are quite similar, so initially, the vessel is not clearly visible. But if we wait a little longer, something interesting happens. The blood that was originally in the imaging slice flows out of the plane, and new blood — containing unflipped spins — flows in from outside. This is what we call the through-plane mechanism.\nBecause the newly arrived blood has not been excited by the RF pulse, it produces no signal in that moment. Meanwhile, the surrounding stationary tissue continues to emit its signal, which gradually decays but does not vanish immediately. As a result, when we collect the data after a short delay, the moving blood appears bright, while the stationary tissue looks relatively dark. This contrast difference allows us to visualize the vasculature clearly.\n\nThe Time-of-Flight effect is strongest when the blood flow is perpendicular to the imaging slice — that is, when blood moves directly through the plane of excitation. If the vessel runs within the plane of the slice, then the same spins remain in the imaging region, and the through-plane mechanism does not work effectively.\n\nSo, to summarize: in CT angiography, iodine contrast enhances X-ray attenuation. In MR angiography, the motion of blood itself provides the contrast, through the time-of-flight effect and the through-plane mechanism. This principle forms the foundation of non-contrast MR angiography, allowing clear visualization of blood flow without any injected contrast agents.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
