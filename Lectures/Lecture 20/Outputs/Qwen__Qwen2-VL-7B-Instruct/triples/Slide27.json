Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow that we understand diffusion tensors, we can visualize them in a colorful way by encoding the three main spatial directions—x, y, and z—into red, green, and blue channels respectively. So, at each location in the image, the color tells us the dominant direction of diffusion, and the brightness shows the degree of anisotropy, or how directional the diffusion is.\n\nFor example, a bright red region indicates that diffusion is strongest along the x-direction, green shows diffusion along y, and blue along z. When these combine, you get intermediate colors—just like mixing red, green, and blue light—forming a vivid, color-coded diffusion map.\nThis type of image is called a fractional anisotropy, or FA map.\n\u000bIt tells us how strongly the diffusion is confined to one particular direction. In regions such as the white matter of the brain, where axonal fibers are highly aligned, the diffusion is strongly anisotropic—so these areas appear bright and vividly colored.\nWhat makes this especially powerful is that we are not only seeing the brain’s anatomy, but also its function and connectivity.\u000bWhile CT imaging primarily gives us anatomical information—showing structures, shapes, and densities—MRI can provide functional information, such as how water and blood move inside tissues.\n\nUsing diffusion-weighted and diffusion-tensor imaging, we can track how water molecules travel along nerve fibers, revealing the brain’s communication pathways. This is one of the reasons MRI is considered both a structural and a functional imaging modality.\nAnd with that understanding of diffusion and perfusion imaging, we are ready to move to the final concept of this section—spectral imaging, which explores the frequency domain information contained in MRI signals.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
