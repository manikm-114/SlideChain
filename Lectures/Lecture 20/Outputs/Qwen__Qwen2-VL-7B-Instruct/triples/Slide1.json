Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHello my students!\nToday we’ll wrap up our MRI part by explaining pulse sequences. Although the title highlights pulse sequences, we’ll also review the overall architecture of an MRI scanner and a few related concepts that tie everything together.\nToward the end of the lecture, I’ll introduce some recent brain-initiative projects and a few emerging ideas in MRI research.\u000bThe main emphasis today follows the green book chapter, so I strongly encourage you to read that section carefully. If you fully understand the ideas we cover in this lecture, you’ll find the final exam easier.\nOf course, I’ll also share a few extra details and insights that go beyond the textbook—these will help you develop a deeper and more practical understanding of MRI as a whole.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}",
