Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, let’s move on to spiral imaging, a powerful and elegant approach that enables even faster data acquisition than echo-planar imaging. In spiral imaging, there is no separate phase encoding step. Instead, both gradient fields — G x and G y — continuously change their amplitudes over time. The relative strength of these two gradients determines the instantaneous slope of the trajectory in k-space.\n\nAt the very beginning, the system starts from the origin of k-space, meaning the initial point of the phase vector is zero. As time progresses, the amplitudes of G x and G y vary smoothly, causing the trajectory to move outward in a spiral pattern. The direction of this spiral is controlled by the relative phase and amplitude ratio between the two gradients. Initially, the trajectory moves along a specific direction for a short distance. Then, as the relative gradient amplitudes change, the slope and direction of the path gradually rotate. This continuous change allows the k-space trajectory to trace a smooth spiral curve, expanding outward from the center as higher spatial frequencies are collected.\n\nThe advantage of this approach is that it provides continuous control over both gradients, allowing highly efficient coverage of k-space. Depending on the design, the spiral can move from the center outward, from the periphery inward, or even use multiple interleaved spirals that fill k-space more densely and reduce artifacts. Because of this flexibility, spiral imaging offers excellent speed while still maintaining high spatial resolution. It captures low-frequency components first — which contain the overall image contrast — and then gradually collects higher-frequency components that define fine structural detail.\nAfter data acquisition, the spiral k-space data must be interpolated onto a rectangular grid before applying the two-dimensional inverse Fourier transform to reconstruct the image. This reconstruction yields T-one-weighted, T-two-weighted, or proton-density-weighted images, depending on how the pulse sequence parameters — such as flip angle, T-E, and T-R — are chosen. Understanding how data are collected in k-space is crucial. If you fully grasp how the gradients define the k-space trajectory — whether linear, zigzag, or spiral — the entire process of MRI image formation becomes intuitive. Otherwise, it can seem abstract or confusing.\n\nFinally, these flexible gradient-based trajectories also open the door to specialized MRI pulse sequences. For example, in MR angiography, we can tailor the sequence to highlight blood flow, just as CT angiography does for X-ray-based imaging. By manipulating the gradient and timing parameters, we can emphasize vascular structures and obtain clear, high-resolution images of the circulatory system. So, spiral imaging not only accelerates acquisition but also serves as a bridge to more advanced and application-specific MRI techniques, such as angiography, diffusion imaging, and functional MRI.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
