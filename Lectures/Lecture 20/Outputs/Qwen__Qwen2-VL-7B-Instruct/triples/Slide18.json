Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, let’s look at how multi-slice imaging works in MRI.\n\nIn MRI, slice selection allows us to excite only a specific region of the body instead of the entire volume. This is achieved by manipulating the resonance frequency of spins within a narrow slice using a gradient field. When we apply the gradient, the magnetic field strength changes linearly along the gradient direction. As a result, spins in different positions experience slightly different Larmor frequencies.\n\nBy sending in a radio-frequency pulse that matches the frequency range of one specific slice, we can flip the magnetization vector, M, only within that selected slice. The rest of the body remains unaffected.\n\nHowever, because the field varies linearly across the slice, the spins acquire different phase shifts — spins in regions of stronger field accumulate larger phase factors, and those in weaker fields accumulate smaller ones. This variation is called dephasing.\n\nTo correct for this, we apply a refocusing, or rephasing pulse, that has the opposite polarity. This pulse restores the overall phase coherence. It doesn’t bring every spin perfectly back to its original state but rephases them on average, so that the net signal becomes measurable again.\nIn the context of slice selection, we call this process defocusing and refocusing. The refocusing gradient usually has half the area of the initial defocusing gradient because we only need to correct the average phase dispersion, not the exact microscopic alignment.\n\nA similar process occurs during frequency encoding. When the frequency-encoding gradient is applied, it introduces another phase variation. To recover the maximum signal strength, a negative gradient pulse with half the area of the first one is applied to refocus the spins again. Although the polarity of the gradient may appear the same in diagrams, the one-hundred-eighty-degree pulse inverts the spin directions, effectively flipping the polarity of the phase, so that the final echo appears consistent in direction.\n\nThe phase-encoding gradient then introduces controlled phase shifts across the slice, allowing each spatial location to contribute a unique signal component. These differences are what allow us to reconstruct distinct pixel values in the final image.\n\nIn the spin-echo sequence, the two key timing parameters are the echo time, T-E, and the repetition time, T-R. By carefully adjusting these parameters, we can control image contrast — and, importantly, the time between echoes can also be used for additional slice selection.\n\nThat’s how we can acquire multiple slices within a single T-R period, as you see in the example here. Each slice is excited and read out in sequence using its own frequency offset, labeled as omega-one, omega-two, omega-three, and so on. This is called multi-slice imaging.\nIt’s a highly efficient way to cover a larger region of the body without increasing the total scan time.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
