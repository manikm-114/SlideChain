Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, the diffusion rate we just talked about is not constant. It varies from place to place — and more importantly, it also depends on direction. If you measure diffusion along one direction, you’ll get a certain value. Measure it along another direction, and you’ll likely get a different one. And along yet another direction, it changes again. So, unlike uniform motion that can be described by a simple vector — where the magnitude represents the speed and the direction shows the path — here, the diffusion rate itself depends on orientation. To describe such directional dependence, we need a more general concept than a vector — and that’s where the tensor comes in.\n\nMathematically, we call this the diffusion tensor, often denoted by capital D. It’s a three-by-three symmetric matrix that characterizes how diffusion behaves along different spatial directions. Each element of this matrix describes the relationship between diffusion along one axis and its coupling with another axis — for example, D one one, D one two, D one three, and so on. This means the diffusion process is anisotropic, or directionally dependent. In biological tissues such as white matter in the brain, water molecules tend to diffuse more easily along the fibers than across them, because the cell membranes and myelin sheaths restrict motion in the perpendicular directions. Similarly, in vasculature, blood and water tend to follow the principal axes of the vessels.\n\nNow, if we extend this idea further, we can describe the random diffusion process mathematically. The probability that a molecule starting at position r-naught moves to position r after some diffusion time, tau, can be expressed using a multivariate Gaussian function. This is written as: p of r given r-naught and tau equals one over (4 pi tau) to the power three-halves times the square root of the determinant of D, multiplied by e to the power of negative (1 over 4 tau) times (r minus r-naught) transpose, times D inverse, times (r minus r-naught). In simpler terms, this function describes the probability distribution of molecular displacement — how far and in what direction the molecules are likely to move during diffusion.\n\nSo, diffusion tensor imaging, or DTI, is the MRI technique that measures this tensor for every voxel in the image. It gives us a complete three-dimensional map of how water diffuses in tissue — allowing us to infer the orientation of fibers and structural connectivity in the brain and other organs.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
