From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, let’s look at an example of an MRI contrast agent — Magnevist. MRI contrast agents are usually paramagnetic materials, meaning they have unpaired electrons that create local magnetic field variations. These variations enhance the local signal intensity and improve the signal-to-noise ratio, allowing us to better differentiate between tissues. When a contrast agent is introduced into the body, it tends to accumulate in regions with rich vasculature, such as tumors. This makes those areas appear brighter in the MRI image, helping radiologists identify abnormal growths or tissue changes.\n\nThe most common class of MRI contrast agents is based on metal ions such as gadolinium, manganese, or europium. Among these, gadolinium is particularly effective because the ion Gd³⁺ has seven unpaired electrons — the maximum possible — which gives it a very strong magnetic moment. However, gadolinium by itself is toxic, so it cannot be injected directly. Instead, it is safely enclosed in a chemical cage, called a chelate, that binds the gadolinium tightly. One of the most widely used formulations is Gadolinium DTPA, or Gadolinium Diethylenetriaminepentaacetic Acid, which is marketed under the trade name Magnevist.\n\nThis compound has been used clinically for many years to enhance MRI scans of the brain, spine, and other organs. It works by creating small magnetic inhomogeneities that shorten relaxation times, giving a strong contrast enhancement in vascular and pathological regions. However, although MRI itself is considered a green and non-ionizing imaging technique — unlike CT, which involves radiation — recent studies have shown that these contrast agents are not entirely harmless. Traces of gadolinium can sometimes remain in the body, leading to concerns about long-term safety, especially for patients who undergo repeated contrast-enhanced MRI scans.\n\nSo while MRI remains fundamentally safe, it’s important to be aware of potential risks associated with certain contrast materials, and to continue developing safer, more biocompatible alternatives for the future.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
