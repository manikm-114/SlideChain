From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s take a quick look at our course schedule to see where we stand. After the MRI part, we have two more major imaging modalities: ultrasound and optical imaging, which are quite different but have their unique utilities.  Finally, I will give you a very brief overall of the emerging area called “deep imaging” or “deep reconstruction”.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
