From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s move on to Phase-Contrast Imaging, which is another powerful method used in MR angiography. Unlike the time-of-flight technique that works mainly through the through-plane mechanism, phase-contrast imaging is an in-plane mechanism — meaning it can detect blood flow in any direction, not just perpendicular to the slice. The basic idea is similar to what we’ve seen in echo-planar imaging. We start with an alpha pulse that flips the magnetization vector, M, by an angle alpha for slice selection. All the spins within the selected slice then work together to produce a coherent signal. As usual, frequency encoding and phase encoding are applied to collect the Fourier information from that slice.\n\nHowever, in a normal Fourier-based MRI scan, the pixel intensities for blood and stationary tissue — in terms of T-one, T-two, or proton density — often appear very similar. This makes it difficult to distinguish flowing blood from static tissue. To separate them, we introduce a pair of bipolar gradient pulses — one positive and one negative — before data acquisition. The first, or positive, gradient pulse adds a phase shift to all spins, and the second, or negative, gradient pulse adds an equal but opposite phase shift. For stationary spins — such as those in soft tissue — these two effects cancel perfectly, leaving no net phase change.\n\nBut if the spins are moving, as in flowing blood, something different happens. Between the two gradient pulses, the blood cells physically move to a new position, so they experience slightly different local magnetic fields. As a result, the positive and negative gradients do not cancel out completely. The motion introduces an extra phase term that accumulates over time, and this additional phase is directly proportional to the velocity of the moving spins. By measuring the difference in phase between two acquisitions — one with and one without motion encoding — we can isolate the component of the signal that depends purely on blood flow. This produces a phase-contrast image, where bright regions correspond to areas of flow and darker regions to stationary tissue.\n\nIn mathematical form, this accumulated phase, phi, is given by an integral of the gradient over time: phi equals the integral from zero to tau over two of gamma times G-x times x of t, d-t, plus the integral from tau over two to tau of gamma times negative G-x times x of t, d-t. The net phase difference reflects the motion of the spins under the bipolar gradients. Conceptually, you can think of time-of-flight imaging as a passive effect, where the signal difference arises simply because new, unflipped blood enters the slice. In contrast, phase-contrast imaging is an active mechanism, where we intentionally encode blood motion into the phase of the signal.\n\nAnd unlike X-ray phase-contrast imaging — which measures refractive index variations — MRI phase-contrast imaging detects the phase shift of the magnetic vector caused by moving spins. It doesn’t matter whether the blood flows up, down, or sideways — as long as the spins move through regions with slightly different magnetic fields, the phase difference can be detected and visualized. By exploiting these motion-induced phase shifts, we can generate clear vascular images and even quantify blood velocity or flow rate. Together with time-of-flight imaging, phase-contrast imaging provides a complete toolkit for visualizing the circulatory system without the need for injected contrast agents.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
