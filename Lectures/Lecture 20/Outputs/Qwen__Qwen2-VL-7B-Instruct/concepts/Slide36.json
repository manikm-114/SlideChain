From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThis has become one of the hottest topics in science — not just in the United States, but also in Europe, China, and Japan. Governments around the world are investing heavily to unlock one of the greatest mysteries of all time: how the human brain works and how intelligence emerges. MRI plays a central role in this global effort because it allows researchers to look inside the living brain — not only to see its structure, but also to monitor its activity in real time.\n\nHere you can see the timeline of the U.S. BRAIN Initiative, which was announced in 2013 by President Obama. The initiative brought together major agencies such as the NIH, NSF, DARPA, and later FDA and IARPA. Each agency contributes in its own way — from developing new tools and technologies, to studying cognition, rehabilitation, and neurological regulation. The research priorities include identifying brain cell types, mapping neural circuits, developing technologies to monitor brain activity, and creating precise intervention tools.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to integrate all of these approaches to achieve a comprehensive understanding of how the brain functions — from the molecular level to behavior. MRI is a key part of this vision, serving as one of the most powerful noninvasive tools for studying the human brain.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
