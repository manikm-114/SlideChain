From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, let’s move to the second spectroscopy method — CSI, which stands for Chemical Shift Imaging. This method extends the idea of PRESS. Instead of selecting a single voxel, CSI allows us to collect spectra from multiple voxels simultaneously, across an entire slice. Here’s how it works. First, you select an axial slice in the z-direction using a 90-degree RF pulse combined with a slice-selection gradient, as shown in the figure. Then, phase encoding is applied in the x and y directions — that’s what the Gx and Gy gradients represent here.\n\nAs a result, the MRI system collects signals from many small voxels arranged in a grid pattern, as you can see on the right. Each voxel now contains its own chemical spectrum, showing peaks from various metabolites, just like the one we saw in PRESS. To reconstruct this data, we perform two-dimensional inverse Fourier transformations with respect to the spatial dimensions x and y, and a forward Fourier transformation with respect to time. This process gives a full spectrum for each voxel, mapping both spatial and chemical information across the slice.\n\nIn simpler terms, PRESS gives you the spectrum from one small volume, while CSI gives you a whole map of spectra from many volumes at once. It’s computationally heavier and takes longer to acquire, but it provides much richer biochemical information throughout the tissue. This technique is particularly valuable in brain spectroscopy, where you can visualize metabolic differences between normal and abnormal tissues. And just like other MRI techniques, the image quality and contrast can be further improved using specialized contrast agents — typically compounds based on magnetic elements with unpaired electrons, which help enhance local magnetic field effects and improve visibility.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
