From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHello my students!\nToday we’ll wrap up our MRI part by explaining pulse sequences. Although the title highlights pulse sequences, we’ll also review the overall architecture of an MRI scanner and a few related concepts that tie everything together.\nToward the end of the lecture, I’ll introduce some recent brain-initiative projects and a few emerging ideas in MRI research.\u000bThe main emphasis today follows the green book chapter, so I strongly encourage you to read that section carefully. If you fully understand the ideas we cover in this lecture, you’ll find the final exam easier.\nOf course, I’ll also share a few extra details and insights that go beyond the textbook—these will help you develop a deeper and more practical understanding of MRI as a whole.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
