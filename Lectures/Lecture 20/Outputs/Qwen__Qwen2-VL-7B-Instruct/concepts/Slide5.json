From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow that’s really fascinating. Let’s take a look at the overall MRI system diagram to understand how all these components work together.\nAt the very top level, the MRI scanner begins with a strong, static magnetic field, denoted as B-zero. This field provides the main alignment for all magnetic moments inside the body.\n\nTo this, we add a rotating magnetic field, called B-one, which is generated by the radio-frequency coil, or R-F coil for short. “R-F” stands for radio frequency, which corresponds to the Larmor frequency—the processional frequency of the spins.\nWhen the system applies this B-one field, the spins are excited, and the resulting signal is induced in the same coil placed nearby. Because the coil operates at the same resonant frequency, it can both transmit and receive the signal effectively.\n\nNow, let’s trace the signal path through the system. Everything begins at the host computer, which contains the control software. The computer sends pulse sequence commands to a pulse programmer or software interface. These commands are then passed to a waveform generator and timing boards, which create precise control signals for the gradient amplifiers and the frequency synthesizer.\n\nThe frequency synthesizer defines the exact frequency of the R-F pulse, and the R-F amplifier boosts that signal to a level strong enough to drive the R-F coil. Through the transmit–receive switch, the system alternates between sending energy into the body and listening for the returning signal.\n\nOn the receiving side, the weak magnetic resonance signal first passes through a preamplifier, which increases its strength without distorting it. Then it goes through receiver blanking—a brief muting step to prevent overload when the transmitter is active. Next, the signal passes through another R-F amplifier, a demodulator, and a quadrature mixer, which separate the real and imaginary components of the complex signal.\n\nThis analog signal is then converted into digital form using an A–D converter, meaning analog to digital converter, and the data are stored in the system’s memory, or RAM. From there, the computer performs a two-dimensional inverse fast Fourier transform, often abbreviated as two-D I-F-F-T, to reconstruct the spatial image from the frequency-domain data, also called k-space.\n\nFinally, the reconstructed image is displayed on the computer screen.\nSo, to summarize — you have the B-zero field providing magnetic alignment, the B-one field for excitation and signal detection, and the gradient fields for spatial encoding. All these are coordinated by computer software that carefully synchronizes every pulse and acquisition step.\nThis is a high-level overview of how an MRI system operates—from the initial excitation pulse all the way to the final image reconstruction.\nNext, we’ll dive a bit deeper into some of the hardware details behind these components.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
