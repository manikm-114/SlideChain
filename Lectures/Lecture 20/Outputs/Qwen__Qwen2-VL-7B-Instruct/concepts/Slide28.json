You can think of it as extending the same Fourier-based idea we’ve been discussing — but now, instead of looking at a single signal per voxel, we analyze multiple frequencies coming from that same voxel. Let’s pay attention to the sentence highlighted here: each voxel emits signals at multiple frequencies, rather than just a single frequency.\n\nIn conventional MRI, after phase and frequency encoding, every pixel or voxel produces one main signal — one frequency — corresponding to its local environment. But in spectral imaging, or what we often call MR spectroscopy, that same voxel emits several frequencies at once. Why does this happen? Because not all water molecules are in the same chemical environment. Some are bound within proteins, some interact with lipids, and others are part of metabolites. Each of these environments slightly shifts the resonance frequency of the hydrogen nuclei — what we call a chemical shift.\n\nAs a result, a single voxel gives rise to multiple peaks — each corresponding to different chemical compounds. For example, in the spectrum shown here, you can see peaks for creatine, choline, glutamate, glutamine, and N-acetylaspartate, or NAA. These molecules tell us about the brain’s biochemical composition — for instance, NAA is a marker of healthy neurons, while choline indicates cell membrane turnover. So, spectral imaging gives us access to biochemical information, not just structural or functional detail. By measuring the exact frequencies and amplitudes of these peaks, we can infer what molecules are present and in what quantities.\n\nThe next natural question is — how do we obtain these signals from a specific pixel or voxel? There are two main approaches, just like the passive and active methods we discussed earlier in angiography. Both techniques let us excite or isolate specific regions in space to record their unique spectral signatures — and we’ll explore those next.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
