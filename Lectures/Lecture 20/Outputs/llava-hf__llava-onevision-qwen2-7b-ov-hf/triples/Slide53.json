Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s talk about the data model behind this concept. As I mentioned earlier, each polarized tracer behaves like a tiny donut that can be flipped in any direction. If the polarization is not aligned with the detector, you won’t detect any signal. But once you flip it to the right orientation, that voxel — or pixel — becomes active, and we can measure it. In this model, for each voxel we have two unknowns: the local attenuation coefficient, which we call “mu of r,” and the local tracer concentration, which we call “lambda of r.”\n\nTo estimate these two unknowns, we make two measurements — one from the left and one from the right — denoted as “m one of r” and “m two of r.” These two measurements are expressed as: m one of r equals phi of r times the exponential of negative integral from minus infinity to r of mu of r d r, and m two of r equals phi of r times the exponential of negative integral from r to infinity of mu of r d r. Here, phi of r represents the gamma-ray flux, and mu of r is the attenuation coefficient along the ray path.\n\nIf we take the logarithm of the ratio “m one of r over m two of r,” we obtain an expression involving the difference of two integrals of mu. By differentiating this relationship, we can recover mu of r directly as negative one-half times the derivative with respect to r of the logarithm of “m one over m two.” Once mu of r is known, we can calculate phi of r, which equals the exponential of the integral of mu of r times m one of r, or equivalently, the exponential of the integral of mu of r times m two of r, depending on direction.\n\nIn simple terms, this means the gamma flux escaping from each side of an activated voxel is proportional to the tracer concentration at that point. So, with just two directional measurements per voxel, we can reconstruct both the attenuation coefficient and the tracer concentration — achieving simultaneous emission and transmission tomography in a single scan. That’s the key idea behind SET, or Simultaneous Emission–Transmission Tomography.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
