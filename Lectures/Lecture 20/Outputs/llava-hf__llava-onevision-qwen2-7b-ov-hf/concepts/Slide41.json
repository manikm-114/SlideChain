From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAnd this idea leads us to the next concept — what we call Omni-tomography.\nOmni-tomography means all-in-one, all-at-once, and all-of-couplings. In other words, we want to bring all imaging modalities — CT, nuclear imaging, and MRI — together into a single integrated system.\n\nInstead of acquiring CT data first, then performing a nuclear scan, and finally running an MRI, the vision is to acquire all the information simultaneously, within one coordinated scan. Imagine a scanner capable of capturing structural, functional, and molecular information — all at the same time, perfectly aligned in space and synchronized in time.\n\nThis concept was proposed and discussed in a perspective paper titled “Towards Omni-Tomography — Grand Fusion of Multiple Modalities for Simultaneous Interior Tomography.” The paper outlines both the motivation and the technical strategies for making this vision possible.\nThe idea is ambitious — it represents the ultimate form of imaging fusion — but it’s also the natural next step in medical imaging, combining everything we’ve learned from CT, MRI, and nuclear imaging into one unified platform.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"omni-tomography\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"CT, nuclear imaging, MRI\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"integrated system\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"simultaneous acquisition\", \"category\": \"workflow\"},\n    {\"term\": \"structural, functional, molecular information\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"aligned in space, synchronized in time\", \"category\": \"reconstruction\"},\n    {\"term\": \"fusion of multiple modalities\", \"category\": \"physics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"interior tomography\", \"category\": \"anatomy\"},\n    {\"term\": \"ultimate form of imaging fusion\", \"category\": \"algorithm\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"And this idea leads us to the next concept — what we call Omni-tomography.
