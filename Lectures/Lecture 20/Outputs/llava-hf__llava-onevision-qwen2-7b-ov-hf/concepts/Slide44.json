From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere, we move toward a more practical version of hybrid imaging — a low-cost system that combines MRI and X-ray together. Instead of using a superconducting magnet as in a high-end MRI system, this design uses a permanent magnetic field, making it much simpler and more compact.\n\nThe concept is quite elegant. For each rotation, you obtain both an MRI projection and an X-ray projection at the same angle. By rotating the system around the patient, you can reconstruct the images together — effectively achieving CT–MRI fusion in a single setup.\n\nThis configuration opens many possibilities for future imaging systems. You can use MRI to guide X-ray imaging, combine anatomical and functional information in real time, and even explore new imaging modes for clinical or research applications.\n\nSo, while high-performance simultaneous CT–MRI scanners represent the top tier of multimodal imaging, this hybrid spiral MR–X-ray system offers a more accessible pathway to achieve similar goals — bringing advanced imaging capabilities within reach for smaller labs or specialized applications.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
