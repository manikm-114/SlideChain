From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, let’s look at how this approach can be extended to whole-body imaging. When we use a polarized radio tracer, we can perform both emission and transmission tomography within the same MRI framework. Because the tracer is polarized, it can emit gamma rays directionally — and since the polarization can be flipped, we can measure signals from multiple directions without rotating any hardware.\n\nThis setup naturally integrates with MRI. So not only can we collect MRI signals, but at the same time, we can measure attenuation, just like in CT, and tracer concentration, as in nuclear imaging. In other words, we can combine the strengths of all three modalities — CT gives us attenuation information, MRI gives us soft-tissue and molecular contrast, and nuclear imaging provides tracer distribution — all in one coordinated system.\n\nHere, you see a concept for whole-body imaging. The patient lies inside a large cylindrical magnet, and the radio tracer inside the body is flipped periodically. Each time the tracer is flipped, gamma rays are emitted in opposite directions. These emissions are detected from both sides, allowing us to reconstruct a complete image of the entire body. A key advantage of this method is that the collimation — or the directional selection of gamma photons — is achieved magnetically. That means we no longer need a mechanical collimator, which normally blocks most photons and wastes energy.\n\nMagnetic collimation captures more of the emitted photons, improving sensitivity and reducing noise. So this design minimizes photon waste and integrates the best parts of CT, MRI, and nuclear imaging — offering a very promising pathway for future multi-modality imaging systems.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
