From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nWe’ve now completed our overview of the MRI scanner hardware—including how the system is configured and how the three key magnetic fields are generated: the B-zero field from the main magnet, the B-one field from the radio-frequency coil, and the gradient fields, G-X, G-Y, and G-Z, which are produced by the gradient coils.\n\nUnderstanding these fundamentals gives you a strong foundation for grasping how MRI actually works. You now know how each component contributes—how the hardware creates, manipulates, and detects magnetic signals that form the basis of MRI imaging.\n\nNext, we’ll move on to the pulse sequences, which define how we control these fields in time to generate different types of images. The first and most fundamental one we’ll discuss is the spin echo sequence. This sequence is the key to producing T-one-weighted, T-two-weighted, and proton-density images—the three major image contrasts used in clinical MRI.\n\nAfter that, we’ll cover gradient echo sequences, which are designed for faster imaging and are commonly used in dynamic studies. Then we’ll extend our discussion to MR angiography for blood flow visualization, diffusion-weighted imaging for tissue microstructure, and MR spectroscopy for biochemical analysis. Finally, we’ll talk about MRI contrast agents—how they work, and the important safety considerations associated with their use.\nSo from this point onward, we’ll move from the hardware foundation of MRI into the timing and control of signals, which is where much of the image contrast and diagnostic power of MRI truly comes from.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
