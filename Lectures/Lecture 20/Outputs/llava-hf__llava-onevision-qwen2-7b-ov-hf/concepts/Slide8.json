From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nIf you look closely, you can see that the entire system is built like a layered cylinder. At the center is the main winding — a set of coils made from a special metal alloy. When this material is cooled to an extremely low temperature, its electrical resistance suddenly disappears. That’s what we call superconductivity.\nNormally, in any electrical circuit, a conductor always has some resistance — no matter how small. But once the temperature drops low enough, the resistance becomes exactly zero. That’s an amazing physical phenomenon. In fact, a professor from our own physics department many years ago did pioneering work on superfluidity and superconductivity, and his research earned a Nobel Prize. So, this topic has deep scientific roots right here on campus.\n\nIn this system, liquid helium is filled into the helium vessel to cool the main windings to superconducting temperatures. The outer layers include vacuum insulation and cold shields — both inner and outer — to prevent heat from entering the chamber. There are also shim coils used to fine-tune the uniformity of the magnetic field inside the bore. The entire setup is housed inside a metal casing to maintain stability and safety.\n\nWhen everything is working properly, a large current circulates continuously through the superconducting wire without any energy loss. That’s the key advantage — it’s energy efficient and can generate an extremely strong and stable magnetic field.\n\nNow, if you look at the first link provided on the slide, it explains more about this superconductive design in detail. The second link, written partly in English and partly in Chinese, was authored by one of my former postdoctoral fellows, Dr. Wei. He proposed a theoretical interpretation of superconductivity and superfluidity from a quantum-mechanical perspective.\n\nAs you may recall, in quantum mechanics, matter is treated as both a wave and a particle. According to the standard theory, the probability wave that describes where a particle might be found is always non-negative — it can be zero or positive, but never negative. Dr. Wei’s extension of the theory suggests that, under certain quantum conditions, the probability wave could actually take on negative values. That would mean a particle might seem to disappear in one region and reappear elsewhere instantly — a phenomenon sometimes described as quantum teleportation.\n\nOf course, whether this interpretation is physically real is still open to debate, but it offers a fascinating theoretical connection between quantum behavior and macroscopic phenomena like superconductivity and superfluidity.\n\nSo, to summarize: in a superconducting magnet, the absence of resistance allows a persistent current to flow indefinitely, producing a strong and stable B-zero field essential for MRI. And at the same time, the underlying physics continues to inspire new ideas that bridge quantum mechanics and medical imaging technology.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
