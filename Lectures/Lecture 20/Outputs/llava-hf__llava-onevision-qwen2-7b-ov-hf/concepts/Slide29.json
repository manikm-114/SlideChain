From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s look at one of the two methods used in MRI spectroscopy — the PRESS method, which stands for Point-Resolved Spectroscopy. This method is commonly used to acquire the MR spectrum from a single voxel — that is, a small three-dimensional volume within the body. Here’s the idea: you begin by applying a 90-degree RF pulse to select a specific slice of tissue, as shown in the figure. Then, you apply two 180-degree pulses, each combined with a gradient field — one along the x direction and another along the y direction. These three pulses — one 90-degree and two 180-degree — together define a small box-shaped region in space.\n\nOnly the nuclei located inside that box experience all three RF pulses, and therefore, only that region contributes to the detected MR signal. Everything outside that voxel is effectively suppressed. Once the voxel is defined, the signal collected from it contains contributions from all the chemical compounds present there — for example, metabolites like creatine, choline, and N-acetylaspartate. When you perform a Fourier transform on that signal, you get a spectrum, which shows the characteristic peaks of these molecules.\n\nSo essentially, PRESS isolates a specific voxel in three dimensions using three orthogonal gradients — Gx, Gy, and Gz — and extracts its spectrum. The next method, called chemical shift imaging, extends this idea further. It’s a bit more complex but very powerful. Instead of acquiring data from just one voxel, it gathers spectral information from multiple voxels across a slice — creating a spatially resolved chemical map. This is a more advanced, and often more time-consuming, approach, but conceptually, it builds directly on what you see here.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
