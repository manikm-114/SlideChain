From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow we’re entering one of the most important ideas in MRI — phase and frequency encoding. Essentially, MRI operates in what we call a Fourier imaging mode, so understanding the Fourier transform is absolutely critical to understanding how images are formed.\nThis slide is really the key to everything that follows. If you can grasp what’s happening here, all the other pulse sequences — no matter how complicated they look — will make much more sense.\n\nIn the stationary reference frame, the overall signal that we detect — or equivalently, the magnetization vector M — is proportional to the proton density, written as rho of x, y. This function describes how many protons exist at each point in a given slice.\n\nWhen we apply phase encoding and frequency encoding gradients, we introduce exponential phase factors into the signal. Mathematically, this means we multiply the signal by e to the power of negative j times gamma times G-x times x times t, and also by e to the power of negative j times gamma times G-y times y times tau pe, where gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, G-x and G-y are the gradient field strengths, and t and tau pe are the times for which those gradients are applied.\n\nThese exponential terms introduce both phase and frequency variations across the image slice. The phase encoding adds a phase shift that depends on position in the Y direction, and the frequency encoding controls how the signal oscillates in time for each X position.\n\nTogether, these variations give each location — each small voxel — a unique combination of frequency and phase. That’s what allows us to reconstruct a tomographic image. Without this encoding, all the information from the slice would be averaged together, and we’d lose spatial detail.\n\nNow, by performing a few mathematical steps — specifically dividing and multiplying by two pi — we can rewrite these expressions in a form that matches the Fourier transform. We define two variables: k-x equals gamma times G-x times t divided by two pi, and k-y equals gamma times G-y times tau pe divided by two pi.\n\nUsing these definitions, the detected signal S of k-x, k-y becomes proportional to the double integral of rho of x, y times e to the power of negative j two pi times (k-x times x plus k-y times y) integrated over x and y. This is exactly the two-dimensional Fourier transform of the object function, rho of x, y.\nSo, the measured data that we collect in MRI — what we call k-space — is simply the Fourier transform of the spatial proton density. Once we’ve filled k-space by varying the gradient fields, we apply an inverse Fourier transform to reconstruct the image in real space.\n\nNow, in practice, the process can go in either order — you can perform phase encoding first, followed by frequency encoding, or vice versa. For each phase-encoding step, we record one line of data in k-space, and by repeating this process many times, we gradually fill the entire k-space grid.\nThe green trajectory shown on the slide illustrates how we move through k-space: phase encoding determines the starting position, and frequency encoding defines the direction in which data are collected. Different pulse sequences change the way we traverse k-space — sometimes line by line, sometimes in spirals or zigzags — but the underlying principle is always the same.\n\nFinally, because of symmetry, if the image function is purely real, we theoretically need to sample only half of k-space. However, in practice, we usually sample the full space to ensure higher accuracy and image stability.\n\nSo, to summarize: phase encoding and frequency encoding translate spatial information into distinct frequency and phase variations. The signals we collect form the Fourier representation of the object in k-space. By applying the inverse Fourier transform, we convert this frequency-domain data back into a real, tomographic image.\nThis is the essence of the k-space theorem, and it’s the mathematical foundation of nearly all MRI imaging methods.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
