From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLast time, I asked you to read the textbook chapter on MRI. By now, many of you have probably gone through the green book and have some familiarity with the hardware components of an MRI system. Let’s review these ideas together so you can build a stronger, more intuitive understanding.\n\nMRI imaging relies on both hardware and software. The hardware provides the physical foundation—magnets, gradient coils, and radio-frequency coils—while the software defines the pulse sequences, the inversion schemes, and the reconstruction algorithms that convert raw signals into images. Together, all these parts form what we call an MRI scanner.\nAt the heart of the scanner is a strong, stationary magnetic field, which we denote as B-zero. Inside this B-zero field, all the tiny magnetic moments in the body—what we call the magnetization vector, or M-vector—naturally align along the direction of B-zero, which we usually define as the z-axis or G-direction.\n\nNext, we introduce a radio-frequency field, called B-one. This is a rotating magnetic field applied perpendicular to B-zero. Because of this rotation, the B-one field exerts a torque on the M-vector, causing it to flip from its resting position toward the x-y plane. In other words, it moves the system from a stable, low-energy state to a higher-energy state.\nOnce magnetization has been flipped into the x-y plane, the spins begin to process, producing an alternating electromagnetic field. If we place detection coils near the sample—or the patient—this changing field induces an electrical signal known as the free-induction decay, or FID. That is the fundamental signal we detect in MRI.\n\nAfter excitation, the M-vector gradually relaxes back to its original, low-energy position aligned with the B-zero field. This relaxation process releases energy, and we can monitor it to extract physical and biological information.\n\nNow, this M-vector is not a single magnet; it represents the collective effect of countless microscopic spins—some pointing slightly up, some slightly down. The small imbalance between them adds up to produce a measurable net magnetization.\nIf we only used B-zero and B-one, we would get information about the entire sample as a whole—but no spatial localization. To achieve tomographic imaging, we need gradient coils that generate linearly varying magnetic fields, denoted G-x, G-y, and G-z. By controlling these gradients, we can selectively encode spatial information: G-z is typically used for slice selection, G-x for frequency encoding, and G-y for phase encoding. Together, these allow us to map the detected signals into k-space—a spatial-frequency domain that follows the Fourier-slice theorem. From there, we apply Fourier transforms and inverse Fourier transforms to reconstruct the final tomographic image.\n\nSo, the hardware provides the data, and the mathematics—mainly Fourier analysis—turns that data into images. This is a high-level overview of how MRI works. If you’ve already reviewed the textbook section on MRI scanner architecture, you should now recognize the key components we’re talking about.\nLet’s move on and look at these elements in more detail.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
