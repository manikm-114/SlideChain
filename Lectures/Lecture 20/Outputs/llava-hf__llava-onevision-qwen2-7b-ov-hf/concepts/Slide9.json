From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, I’m not an expert in electromagnet design, but let me share some essential information so you can understand the concept clearly.\nThe large superconducting magnet provides the strong, uniform B-zero field—that’s our background magnetic field. But to create spatial encoding for imaging, we also need additional gradient fields.\n\nSo, how do we generate these gradient fields? A magnetic gradient means that the magnetic field changes linearly with position. In other words, the field strength increases or decreases in a straight-line fashion along one direction.\n\nTo achieve this, the MRI scanner uses three separate gradient coils, which produce fields we call B-X, B-Y, and B-Z. Each of these gradients corresponds to one of the three spatial directions: X, Y, and Z.\n\nIf you look at the illustration, you can see how the coils are wound differently to produce different kinds of gradients. The middle portion of each field—the region near the center of the magnet—is approximately linear. That’s the part we actually use during imaging. Outside the center, the field is not perfectly linear, but that’s okay, because we only rely on this central, uniform region for accurate encoding.\n\nBy wiring the coils in specific patterns, we can make the magnetic field vary linearly along any chosen direction. So, for example, one coil arrangement gives you a gradient along the Z direction, another gives a gradient along Y, and another along X.\n\nWe don’t need to go deep into Maxwell’s equations here—that would require advanced electromagnetic theory. For now, it’s enough to have a heuristic understanding: when we wind the coils in a certain configuration, the resulting magnetic field changes linearly in space, and that’s exactly what we need to distinguish signals from different locations inside the body.\n\nSo, remember — the B-zero field provides the uniform background alignment, and the gradient coils introduce controlled, linear variations along X, Y, and Z, which allow the MRI system to encode spatial information for image reconstruction.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
