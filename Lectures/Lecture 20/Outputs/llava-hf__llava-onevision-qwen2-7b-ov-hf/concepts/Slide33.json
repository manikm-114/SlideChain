From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s talk about MRI safety, especially regarding the use of gadolinium-based contrast agents. Gadolinium, symbol Gd, is one of the 17 rare-earth elements and belongs to the lanthanide series of metals. It’s a paramagnetic material, meaning it has unpaired electrons that interact with magnetic fields. This property makes gadolinium extremely useful for enhancing the contrast in MRI scans, helping us visualize blood flow, tissue abnormalities, and tumors more clearly.\n\nHowever, gadolinium itself is highly toxic to humans. It has no natural biological role and is not found anywhere in the human body under normal conditions. The problem arises because gadolinium ions are similar in size and charge to calcium ions, which are essential for many cellular processes. When free gadolinium ions enter the body, they can interfere with calcium-dependent mechanisms, disrupting normal cell function. To minimize this risk, gadolinium is used in a chelated form, meaning it is locked inside a chemical cage — such as DTPA — to prevent the toxic metal from interacting directly with tissues.\n\nHowever, studies have shown that not all of the gadolinium is completely excreted from the body after an MRI. Small amounts can remain in the brain, kidneys, and other organs, even months or years later. This residual gadolinium may lead to inflammation, oxidative stress, neurological effects, or even genetic damage at the cellular level. Over the past decade, these concerns have prompted major regulatory changes. The European Medicines Agency has restricted or banned the clinical use of several widely used gadolinium-based contrast agents, particularly those that release gadolinium more easily.\n\nSo, while MRI itself is a non-ionizing and generally safe imaging modality, the contrast agents we use must be handled with caution. This is why the field is actively researching safer alternatives — agents that are more stable, biodegradable, or even completely free of gadolinium — to make MRI an even safer tool for medical diagnosis.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
