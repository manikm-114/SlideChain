From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, let’s talk about diffusion-weighted imaging, or DWI for short. Remember, our body is made up mostly of water, and these water molecules are constantly moving around. This motion — or diffusion — becomes physiologically and pathologically important, especially when something goes wrong at the cellular level. For example, when a cell membrane becomes swollen or damaged, water can leak out of the cell, altering the normal diffusion and perfusion patterns in that tissue. That’s why studying how water moves can tell us a lot about what’s happening inside the body — particularly in the brain — in cases like stroke, tumor, or inflammation.\n\nNow, conceptually, diffusion-weighted imaging is similar to angiography imaging, because both deal with motion — but in DWI, we’re focusing on the microscopic motion of water molecules rather than blood flow. The pulse sequence looks a little different, but the underlying idea remains very similar. Here, we use a spin-echo sequence with a 90-degree excitation pulse followed by a 180-degree refocusing pulse. You’ll notice two gradient pulses, placed symmetrically on both sides of the 180-degree pulse — these are called diffusion-sensitizing gradients.\n\nWe already know that a 180-degree pulse flips the magnetization vector upside down. So, from the perspective of the first gradient pulse, the second one has the opposite polarity. If nothing in the tissue is moving — meaning the water molecules are stationary — then whatever phase shift is induced by the first gradient will be perfectly canceled out by the second one. In that case, there is no net signal change. But if the water molecules move between the two gradient pulses — for example, diffusing from one position to another — they experience slightly different magnetic field strengths at those two locations. As a result, the phase shifts from the two gradients no longer cancel out perfectly. This causes a measurable signal loss, which tells us that motion or diffusion has occurred.\n\nThe signal attenuation due to diffusion depends on three main factors: first, the gradient strength, represented by capital G; second, the duration of each gradient pulse, denoted by the Greek letter delta; and third, the time separation between the two gradients, represented by capital Delta. Together, these parameters determine how sensitive the sequence is to molecular motion. The diffusion-related signal intensity can be expressed as I of G n equals I zero times e to the power of negative D gamma squared G n squared delta squared times (Delta minus delta over three). This equation shows how the measured signal decreases with stronger diffusion.\n\nPractically, we don’t need to go through the derivation — the key takeaway is that diffusion efficiency can be quantified and used as a diagnostic marker. In a typical spin-echo sequence, the gradients can be applied along the x, y, or z direction, depending on which axis of diffusion we want to measure. For example, diffusion in the through-plane direction — perpendicular to the imaging slice — can reveal how water molecules move between layers of tissue. When diffusion appears unusually high, it may indicate disrupted or damaged cellular structure, such as in ischemic tissue. So, by analyzing diffusion in this way, we gain valuable insight into both normal physiology and pathological conditions.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
