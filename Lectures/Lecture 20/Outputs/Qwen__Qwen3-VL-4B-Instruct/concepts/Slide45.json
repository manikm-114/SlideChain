From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nWhen a patient undergoes radiation therapy for cancer, a highly energetic beam is directed toward the tumor to destroy cancerous cells. However, the accuracy of this beam is critical — we need to know precisely where the tumor is during treatment, and that’s where image guidance becomes essential.\n\nWhat you see here is a new concept that integrates interior MRI with a medical linear accelerator. The idea is to use MRI imaging to continuously visualize a small region of interest — the area where the tumor resides — while radiation therapy is being delivered. This allows us to target the tumor with submillimeter precision and adjust in real time if the tumor moves due to breathing or other physiological motion.\n\nThis work is being developed in collaboration with colleagues at UT Southwestern, where we are exploring how this interior MRI can guide radiation delivery and make cancer therapy safer and more effective.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
