From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAnd this idea leads us to the next concept — what we call Omni-tomography.\nOmni-tomography means all-in-one, all-at-once, and all-of-couplings. In other words, we want to bring all imaging modalities — CT, nuclear imaging, and MRI — together into a single integrated system.\n\nInstead of acquiring CT data first, then performing a nuclear scan, and finally running an MRI, the vision is to acquire all the information simultaneously, within one coordinated scan. Imagine a scanner capable of capturing structural, functional, and molecular information — all at the same time, perfectly aligned in space and synchronized in time.\n\nThis concept was proposed and discussed in a perspective paper titled “Towards Omni-Tomography — Grand Fusion of Multiple Modalities for Simultaneous Interior Tomography.” The paper outlines both the motivation and the technical strategies for making this vision possible.\nThe idea is ambitious — it represents the ultimate form of imaging fusion — but it’s also the natural next step in medical imaging, combining everything we’ve learned from CT, MRI, and nuclear imaging into one unified platform.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
