Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nBuilding upon that idea, this slide shows our interior tomography approach for MRI-guided radiation therapy.\nHere, the MRI system is designed not to image the entire body but to focus only on a specific region of interest, such as the tumor area. This design uses superconducting coils and gradient coils arranged in a compact geometry that allows radiation beams to pass through while maintaining the ability to generate precise MRI images of the target zone.\n\nThis compact “interior MRI” setup makes it possible to integrate the MRI system directly into a linear accelerator — the same device used for delivering radiation therapy. With this configuration, we can track the tumor in real time and adjust the beam accordingly, ensuring that radiation precisely targets the cancer while sparing surrounding healthy tissue.\n\nAlong this same direction, our latest research—published last year—introduces an even more advanced concept based on polarized radio tracers, which bridges the gap between traditional gamma-ray imaging and MRI-based methods.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
