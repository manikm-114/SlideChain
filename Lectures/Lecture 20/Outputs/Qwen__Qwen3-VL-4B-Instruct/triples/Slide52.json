Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, let’s look at how all of this comes together in the system design.\u000bIn this setup, you can selectively activate or turn on any voxel or pixel by controlling the magnetic gradients and RF pulses we just discussed.\nEach polarized nucleus—such as xenon or krypton—can be individually manipulated using precise gradient fields in the x, y, and z directions. The coils you see here generate those magnetic field gradients, while the surrounding detectors collect the emitted gamma photons.\n\nSo, depending on which gradient and RF pulse combination you apply, you can excite a specific spatial region, measure its response, and reconstruct the image point by point.\n\nThis concept essentially merges nuclear emission detection with MRI-style spin control, enabling us to perform polarized nuclear imaging in a controlled and highly selective way. It’s a very elegant system, because we can combine magnetic resonance encoding with nuclear emission detection—bringing together the best of both imaging worlds.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
