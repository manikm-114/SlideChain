Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nWith this polarized nuclear imaging framework, we can perform both emission and transmission tomography simultaneously.\u000bHowever, to make this practical, we need suitable polarized radioisotopes, or tracers.\n\nThis table lists a few existing candidates — isotopes of xenon and krypton — that can, in principle, be polarized and used for such imaging.\u000bFor example, xenon-131m has a half-life of about twelve days and a gamma emission energy around one hundred sixty-four kilo–electron volts.\u000bXenon-127m decays faster — with a half-life of sixty-nine seconds, emitting gamma rays between one hundred twenty-five and one hundred seventy kilo–electron volts.\n\u000bAnd krypton-79m has a half-life of about fifty seconds, with gamma emission near one hundred thirty kilo–electron volts.\nYou can see the challenge here: ideally, a good clinical tracer should have a half-life around thirty minutes, long enough for preparation and imaging, but short enough to minimize radiation dose. Unfortunately, none of these isotopes fit that range — they are either too long or too short.\nThat’s why our team has been collaborating with chemists and nuclear physicists to identify or synthesize new polarizable tracers with more suitable half-lives and emission properties.\n\u000bIf such tracers can be developed, they would make simultaneous emission–transmission tomography a realistic and powerful imaging tool for the future.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
