Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nTo move toward this vision of omni-tomography, we began by building a toy system — a small prototype that integrates all the scanners together in one setup.\nHere you can see a conceptual model where CT, PET, SPECT, and MRI components are arranged concentrically around a common patient table. The idea is to allow all the modalities to operate within the same geometry so that they can collect data simultaneously from the same region of interest.\n\nIn this design, the PET ring and SPECT detectors are positioned together with an X-ray tube and detector pair for CT imaging, while a specially designed open MRI magnet provides the magnetic field without blocking the other modalities. This required careful electromagnetic shielding and mechanical design to ensure that each subsystem could operate without interference.\n\nAfter developing this integrated model, we focused on building a functional MRI subsystem, completing its design as a key step toward realizing a fully combined, all-in-one scanner. This system demonstrates the feasibility of truly simultaneous, multimodal imaging — a step closer to our long-term goal of achieving comprehensive, unified tomography for both research and clinical applications.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
