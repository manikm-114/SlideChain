Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nIn multi-slice imaging, we can further optimize how slices are acquired. For example, we can excite slice three, then slice four, and then slice two, alternating the order to maximize time efficiency. This alternating strategy helps reduce the blurring or cross-talk that can occur when slices are too close together in time or space. By allowing enough separation between successive excitations, we achieve cleaner and more distinct images.\n\nNow, the spin-echo sequence we just discussed provides an excellent signal-to-noise ratio, because it effectively cancels out the dephasing caused by T-two-star effects. This gives us a pure T-two-weighted signal that’s highly reliable for tissue contrast. However, the main drawback is that the spin-echo sequence takes a long time. A full imaging session can easily last half an hour or more, which is often too slow for many clinical applications.\n\nTo address this limitation, we use gradient-echo imaging as an alternative. In a gradient-echo sequence, there is no one-hundred-eighty-degree refocusing pulse. This omission greatly shortens both the echo time, or T-E, and the repetition time, T-R. Because there’s no refocusing pulse, gradient-echo imaging does not compensate for magnetic field inhomogeneities, so the signal decays more quickly according to T-two-star relaxation rather than pure T-two.\nTo keep the signal strong and the scan fast, the echo time — T-E — is kept as short as possible, typically just a few milliseconds. In addition, the flip angle of the radio-frequency pulse is reduced to a small value, usually well below ninety degrees. This allows for rapid repetition of pulses and enables much faster imaging — often completing a full scan in less than a minute.\n\nThere are several variations of gradient-echo sequences, including: FLASH, which stands for Fast Low-Angle Shot; FISP, or Fast Imaging with Steady Precession; GRASS, which uses Gradient-Refocused Acquisition in the Steady State; and SSFP, or Steady-State Free Precession. Each of these methods is built on the same principle: using small flip angles and gradient rephasing instead of a 180-degree pulse to achieve high-speed imaging.\n\nFor any given repetition time, T-R, there exists an optimal flip angle that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio. This is known as the Ernst angle, given by the formula: alpha Ernst equals cosine inverse of e to the power of negative T-R divided by T-one. By choosing the Ernst angle, we balance image contrast and signal strength for efficient imaging.\n\nSo, to summarize: spin echo sequences give you excellent image quality but require long scan times, gradient echo sacrifices some signal stability for dramatically faster acquisition, and together, these two techniques form the foundation of nearly all MRI pulse sequences used in practice today.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
