With this polarized nuclear imaging framework, we can perform both emission and transmission tomography simultaneously.However, to make this practical, we need suitable polarized radioisotopes, or tracers.

This table lists a few existing candidates — isotopes of xenon and krypton — that can, in principle, be polarized and used for such imaging.For example, xenon-131m has a half-life of about twelve days and a gamma emission energy around one hundred sixty-four kilo–electron volts.Xenon-127m decays faster — with a half-life of sixty-nine seconds, emitting gamma rays between one hundred twenty-five and one hundred seventy kilo–electron volts.
And krypton-79m has a half-life of about fifty seconds, with gamma emission near one hundred thirty kilo–electron volts.
You can see the challenge here: ideally, a good clinical tracer should have a half-life around thirty minutes, long enough for preparation and imaging, but short enough to minimize radiation dose. Unfortunately, none of these isotopes fit that range — they are either too long or too short.
That’s why our team has been collaborating with chemists and nuclear physicists to identify or synthesize new polarizable tracers with more suitable half-lives and emission properties.
If such tracers can be developed, they would make simultaneous emission–transmission tomography a realistic and powerful imaging tool for the future.
