Now, let’s talk about the B-one field, which is the missing component we haven’t discussed yet. This field is generated by the radio-frequency coil, or R-F coil.
The most common type of RF coil used for transmitting the B-one field is called a birdcage coil, shown on the left. You can understand this coil design quite intuitively. It looks like the frame of a cylindrical cage — a circular structure with evenly spaced conducting bars connected at both ends by rings.

When an alternating current flows through these bars, it creates a rotating magnetic field inside the bore. This rotating field is the B-one field, which is applied perpendicular to the main magnetic field B-zero. The B-one field is responsible for exciting the protons and flipping the magnetization vector, M, away from its alignment with B-zero.

On the right side of the slide, you can see other kinds of RF coils as well. The surface coil, shown in the middle, is used for imaging regions close to the surface of the body — for example, the shoulder or knee. Because it’s placed near the area of interest, it gives excellent signal-to-noise ratio locally, though it doesn’t cover deep tissues as well.

The third design, shown on the right, is a phased-array coil. This one combines multiple small coil elements arranged in an array. Each coil picks up signals from a different region, and the signals are combined by the system to produce a high-quality image. Phased arrays are very useful for spine imaging and other applications where we need both wide coverage and high sensitivity.

In summary:The birdcage coil is typically used for transmission — it creates a uniform B-one field, ideal for brain or whole-body imaging.The surface coil is best for localized, high-resolution scans near the body surface.The phased-array coil allows us to combine multiple receiver channels for stronger and faster imaging.
So, the RF coils are essential for both transmitting the B-one excitation field and receiving the MRI signal from the body, making them one of the most important components in the entire imaging chain.
