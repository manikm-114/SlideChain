For your homework, I’d like you to draw diagrams for all the pulse sequences we discussed in this lecture. That includes spin echo, gradient echo, diffusion-weighted imaging, and spectroscopy sequences. Along with each diagram, please explain the working principle — how the sequence works and what kind of information it provides.

Also, please watch the YouTube video I mentioned earlier; it will help you better visualize how MRI can even be used for mind-reading research. Try to connect what you see in the video and what we discussed today about MRI signal generation and brain imaging. Then, take some time to read the textbook section on MRI so you’re well prepared for our next lecture on ultrasound imaging.

Thank you, and I’ll see you in the next class.
