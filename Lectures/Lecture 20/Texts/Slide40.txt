So here we come to one of the most exciting directions — imaging modality fusion.

In this triangle, you see the three major imaging technologies: CT, MRI, and PET or SPECT. Each of them has unique strengths — CT provides excellent structural detail and shows calcification and bone; MRI gives superb soft-tissue contrast and functional information; and PET or SPECT provides metabolic and molecular insights.

In recent years, CT has already been combined with PET or SPECT, and MRI has also been paired with PET in what we call PET/MRI scanners — Siemens, for example, developed a system called the MRI Pattern Scanner to take advantage of this synergy.

But the combination of CT and MRI remains one of the most challenging yet most promising directions. In cardiac imaging, for example, CT clearly shows the coronary vasculature and calcifications, while MRI reveals the soft tissue and functional aspects of the heart. Together, they can provide a comprehensive picture of both structure and physiology.

Ultimately, our goal — and the vision our group has been promoting — is to bring all imaging modalities together in one integrated system, so that we can visualize anatomy, function, and molecular information simultaneously. That would be the true “all-in-one” scanner of the future — the complete fusion of CT, MRI, and nuclear imaging.
