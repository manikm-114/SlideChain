Now we come to one of the fastest MRI imaging techniques — Echo-Planar Imaging, or EPI. In this sequence, the magnetization vector, M, is first flipped into the x–y plane using a ninety-degree radio-frequency pulse. Next, slice selection is performed to isolate a specific plane — for example, the x–y plane of the imaging region. Once the slice is selected, the imaging process begins with a combination of phase encoding and frequency encoding that alternate in an oscillating pattern. This means that the frequency-encoding gradient repeatedly switches direction — first positive, then negative, then positive again — while data are continuously acquired.

As a result, the signal alternates between positive and negative readouts, forming a continuous train of echoes. Each echo corresponds to one horizontal line in k-space, and the entire pattern forms a zig-zag trajectory across k-space, as shown on the right side of the slide. Let’s interpret this step by step: slice selection determines the imaging plane, typically the x–y plane. Phase encoding moves the position in k-space vertically — that is, along the k-y direction — shifting the data line by line. Frequency encoding determines the horizontal readout, or the k-x direction, as the data are collected. Each line of k-space is traversed in alternating directions: the first line moves from left to right, the next line from right to left, and so on. This continuous acquisition pattern allows us to collect a full image, or at least a major portion of it, in a single shot.

However, as data acquisition progresses, the signal amplitude gradually decreases due to T-two-star decay, which limits how long useful data can be collected. Because of this decay, echo planar imaging may sometimes cover only part of k-space during one acquisition, requiring multiple passes to fill in the remaining data. Even with that limitation, EPI is dramatically faster than conventional three-dimensional gradient-echo imaging. In fact, it can complete a full image in just a fraction of a second. That’s why echo planar imaging has become the foundation for real-time MRI and functional MRI, where rapid temporal sampling is more important than perfect image contrast.

And when we want to go even faster, we can move beyond echo planar imaging to spiral imaging, which traces k-space in smooth circular trajectories, further reducing acquisition time.
