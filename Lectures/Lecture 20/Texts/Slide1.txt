Hello my students!
Today we’ll wrap up our MRI part by explaining pulse sequences. Although the title highlights pulse sequences, we’ll also review the overall architecture of an MRI scanner and a few related concepts that tie everything together.
Toward the end of the lecture, I’ll introduce some recent brain-initiative projects and a few emerging ideas in MRI research.The main emphasis today follows the green book chapter, so I strongly encourage you to read that section carefully. If you fully understand the ideas we cover in this lecture, you’ll find the final exam easier.
Of course, I’ll also share a few extra details and insights that go beyond the textbook—these will help you develop a deeper and more practical understanding of MRI as a whole.
