Now, let’s look at the motivation for Simultaneous Emission–Transmission Tomography, or SET.This idea comes from a concept called Polarized Nuclear Imaging, abbreviated as PNI, which builds on the magnetic resonance (MR) framework.
In conventional nuclear imaging, gamma-ray photons are emitted randomly in all directions. However, with a polarized radio tracer, the emission becomes directionally dependent. That means the gamma rays are no longer isotropic — they are preferentially emitted along specific directions.

As shown in the figure, when nuclei are fully polarized along a magnetic field, the emitted gamma rays have a strong preference for the horizontal direction, and almost none are emitted vertically. By using RF pulses and magnetic field manipulations, similar to those in MRI, we can flip this polarization vector — sometimes called the M vector — to control the emission direction.

In other words, by flipping the spins with an RF pulse, we can switch from collecting gamma rays along the x–y plane to collecting them along the z direction. This enables us to encode spatial information into the atomic spin orientation, essentially merging nuclear imaging and magnetic resonance mechanisms.
The result is that polarized nuclear imaging provides much higher sensitivity than conventional MRI, since the signal is derived directly from gamma emission rather than from weak magnetic resonance. The only drawback is that it does not account for attenuation, which is usually handled by CT.

Our recent paper builds on this idea — showing that by using a polarized tracer, we can reconstruct both the radioactive tracer concentration and the attenuation background simultaneously, combining what MRI and CT each do best into a single integrated framework.
