Now, let’s take a closer look at how the birdcage coil produces a uniform B-one field. If you consider the two cross-sections shown here, the idea is quite intuitive. When the current in one connecting wire flows in a particular direction, it generates a local magnetic field pointing downward. To produce a local field pointing upward, the current in the adjacent wire must flow in the opposite direction, forming a closed loop.

This basic configuration—currents flowing in opposite directions through adjacent loops—creates magnetic fields that point downward in some regions and upward in others. When multiple loops or cross-sections are added around the cylinder, these individual magnetic fields combine to form a uniform field across the entire region inside the coil.

Mathematically, this can be shown by modulating the current as a sinusoidal function of the angular position, which we call phi. If you plot the current intensity as a function of the phi angle, it varies like a sine wave—starting from zero at phi equals zero degrees, reaching a maximum at ninety degrees, and then becoming negative at one hundred eighty degrees. This sinusoidal modulation ensures that the magnetic field intensity remains uniform across the cross-section.

To make the B-one field rotate in space, the current itself is also modulated over time, so that the maximum and minimum of the field continuously move around the coil. As a result, the B-one field rotates smoothly, allowing it to flip the magnetization vector, M, in a controlled and consistent way during excitation.

In essence, this is how we achieve a uniform rotating magnetic field that interacts with the main B-zero field. Together, the B-zero field, B-one field, and the three gradient fields—G-sub-X, G-sub-Y, and G-sub-Z—form the complete electromagnetic environment of the MRI system.
What’s truly fascinating is that all of these ideas—the generation of magnetic fields, their directions, and the way they add up—can actually be explained using high school physics: Ampère’s law, the right-hand rule, and the principle of superposition.

Of course, for real MRI coil design, we need precise optimization to make sure the fields are uniform and stable. That’s done through finite element analysis, a numerical technique that lets engineers compute the detailed magnetic field distribution and fine-tune the geometry of the coil.
So, while the physical concept is beautifully simple, the practical realization requires sophisticated computation and engineering.
