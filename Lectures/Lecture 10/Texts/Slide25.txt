One way to remove the background signal and make small changes easier to detect is by using a Wheatstone bridge.

The Wheatstone bridge is essentially two voltage dividers connected side by side. On the left divider, we have resistors R 1 and R 2; on the right divider, we have resistors R 3 and R4. The output voltage, V_out, is measured between the midpoints of these two dividers.
If the ratios of the resistors are chosen so that R 1 over R 2 equals R 4 over R 3, the two dividers produce exactly the same voltage at their midpoints, and V_out is zero. This is called the null mode — no signal at the output when the bridge is balanced.

Now, if one of the resistors — typically R 3 — is actually a sensor whose resistance changes slightly, say from R knot to R knot times (1 plus x), the bridge becomes unbalanced. This small change in R 3 produces a nonzero V out, even though the original background voltage was canceled out.

In deflection mode, we can write V out as the supply voltage V c c multiplied by the difference between the left divider ratio and the right divider ratio. Because the bridge starts balanced, even a very small change in R 3 creates a measurable output.
The advantage is that we’ve removed the large constant voltage and isolated only the change we care about. This makes it possible to apply high gain to that small signal without saturating the system.
