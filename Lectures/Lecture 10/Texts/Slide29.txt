Even though an operational amplifier is an active component, the basic circuit laws still apply — Kirchhoff’s Current Law and Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law always hold.

But for op amps, we have two special rules that make analysis much easier:
Rule one: The two input terminals are at the same voltage.This happens because the op amp’s gain is extremely large. Even the tiniest difference between the inputs is amplified so much that the output adjusts to make the two inputs essentially equal in voltage.
Rule two: No current flows into either input terminal.The input impedance of an op amp is extremely high — ideally infinite — so no measurable current enters the inputs.

These two rules are the foundation for almost all op amp circuit analysis. They let us treat the inputs as if they are at the same voltage and as if they draw no current, which simplifies solving even complex amplifier circuits.
