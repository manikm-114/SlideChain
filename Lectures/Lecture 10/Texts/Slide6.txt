Now, let’s look at the inductor. Its voltage–current relationship is similar in form to the capacitor’s, but with the roles of voltage and current reversed.

For an inductor, the voltage v is equal to the inductance L multiplied by the rate of change of current — in other words,v equals L times the derivative of i with respect to time.

We can also express this in integral form:I equals one over L times the integral of v with respect to time, plus the initial current.
So, for a capacitor, current depends on how quickly voltage changes. For an inductor, voltage depends on how quickly current changes. Capacitors store energy in an electric field, while inductors store energy in a magnetic field.

These three components — resistor, capacitor, and inductor — are the building blocks of classic electrical circuits. Understanding their voltage–current relationships is essential before we move on to phasors, which will make analyzing AC circuits much easier.
