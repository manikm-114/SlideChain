Let’s take a moment to revisit complex numbers, because they form the foundation for understanding phasors.

A complex number has two parts — a real part, x, and an imaginary part, y. We can represent this on a complex plane, with the horizontal axis for the real part and the vertical axis for the imaginary part. This is like a Cartesian coordinate system.
But there’s another way to represent the same point — using polar coordinates. Instead of x y, we describe it by its distance from the origin, called the magnitude r, and its angle from the real axis, called the phase angle phi.

Mathematically, we can write this as r times e to the power i phi. Here, e to the power i phi comes from Euler’s formula, which says e to the i phi equals cosine phi plus i times sine phi. Multiplying r by those components gives us back x y.

When we analyze sinusoidal signals, like in AC circuits, we often know the frequency in advance. In that case, the important quantities are the magnitude r, which tells us the signal’s strength, and the phase angle phi, which tells us where the waveform starts in time.
Instead of writing out the full exponential, we can use the simpler phasor notation: r angle phi. For example, if we know an AC current has a magnitude of 5 amperes and a phase angle of 30 degrees, we can write it as “5 at angle 30 degrees.”

This phasor approach is a very convenient way to describe sinusoidal signals, and as we’ll see, it makes circuit analysis much simpler.
