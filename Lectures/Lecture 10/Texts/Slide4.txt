Let’s start with the most basic electrical component — the resistor.
You already know Ohm’s Law, which tells us that the voltage across a resistor equals the current flowing through it multiplied by its resistance. In words,v equals i times R.
We can also rearrange this to say that the current i equals the voltage v divided by the resistance R.This means the current is directly proportional to the applied voltage and inversely proportional to the resistance.
The name resistor comes from its function — it resists the flow of electric current. In other words, it limits how many electrons can pass through it for a given voltage.

Next, we’ll move on to another fundamental component — the capacitor.
