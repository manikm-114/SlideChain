For your homework, I’d like you to work through this sensitivity analysis problem.

The idea is to determine how to choose the resistor values so that the circuit’s sensitivity is as high as possible. Sensitivity here is defined as the derivative of V out​ with respect to x, where x represents a small fractional change in the sensor resistance.
In other words, if x changes just a little, we want V out​ to change as much as possible. That’s what we mean by “high sensitivity.”

You’ll be able to adjust both R L​ and R S​. If you work through the math, you’ll find that the sensitivity reaches its maximum when the two resistances are equal.
