Let’s learn how to replace two impedances with a single equivalent impedance.

Series connection — one after the other on the same branch:The same current flows through both, and the voltage drops add.
So the equivalent is:“Z sub e equals Z one plus Z two.”This works even when the impedances are complex.
A one-line proof, spoken: assume a current I flows.The total voltage is I times Z sub e.It is also I times Z one plus I times Z two.Set them equal and cancel I: “Z sub e equals Z one plus Z two.”
Parallel connection — the two elements share the same two nodes:The voltage across each is the same, and the currents add.
So the equivalent is:“one over Z sub e equals one over Z one plus one over Z two,”or, equivalently,“Z sub e equals Z one times Z two, divided by Z one plus Z two.”
Quick proof, spoken: let the common voltage be V.Currents are I 1 = V over Z 1 and I 2 = V over Z 2.Total current I = I 1 plus I 2 = V times (1 over Z 1 plus 1 over Z 2).But I = V over Z sub e.Cancel V to get the reciprocal form above.
