Let’s take a closer look at the imaginary unit i and understand it from a geometric perspective using Euler’s formula:e to the i theta equals cosine theta plus i times sine theta.

If we set theta to 90 degrees, e to the i 90° gives us i. You can think of multiplying by i as rotating a vector by 90 degrees in the complex plane. For example, if we start with the unit vector at 1 on the real axis and multiply by i, it rotates to point straight up along the imaginary axis.

If we multiply by i again — another 90-degree rotation — we end up at negative 1 on the real axis. In other words, i times i equals –1. That’s the origin of the idea that i is the square root of negative one.

More generally, multiplying by e to the i theta rotates a vector by an angle theta, while multiplying by a real number r simply scales its length. This gives a very natural, visual way to think about complex multiplication — scaling changes the magnitude, and the exponential term changes the direction.

Addition is also straightforward: if you have two complex numbers, u and v, you add their real parts and their imaginary parts separately. Graphically, that’s just adding two vectors tip-to-tail to get u plus v.
With these rules for addition and multiplication, we have a complete algebraic system for complex numbers. And this system is extremely powerful for representing sinusoidal waves — the building blocks of Fourier analysis — as well as for solving wave equations in fields like ultrasound and electromagnetics.

This is why the phase representation, using complex numbers, is such a fundamental tool in engineering and physics.
