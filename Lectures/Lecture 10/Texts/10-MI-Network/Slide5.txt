Here we have the capacitor — another fundamental circuit component.
When we connect a voltage source, such as a battery, across the capacitor, electrons are pushed toward one plate, creating a buildup of negative charge. On the opposite plate, a positive charge accumulates. Importantly, the capacitor itself doesn’t let electrons pass directly through; instead, the charges stay separated by an insulating material called the dielectric.
As more charge accumulates, an opposing electric field develops across the plates. Eventually, this field balances the applied voltage, and the current flow stops.

Mathematically, the relationship between voltage and current for a capacitor is given by:I equals C times the derivative of v with respect to time.In words, the current is proportional to how quickly the voltage changes over time.We can also write it in integral form:v equals one over C times the integral of i with respect to time, plus the initial voltage.

This is different from a resistor, where voltage and current are simply proportional. For a capacitor, the key is the rate of voltage change — no change in voltage means no current flows.
