Before we dive into networks, let’s recall the two related ideas we’ve already discussed — functions and systems.
A function is a mathematical concept. It takes an input, processes it according to some rule, and produces an output. You can think of it in terms of a domain and a range.A system is essentially the same idea, but we often use this term in engineering. We talk about inputs and outputs, and the system could be simple or complex.

Now, a network is really just a more complex kind of system — one made up of many interconnected subsystems. The internet is a perfect example: millions of computers linked together, exchanging information. From a mathematical perspective, you can think of a network as a very complicated function, often involving many variables and composite functions linked together.

In electrical engineering, we often study electrical networks, where components like resistors, capacitors, and inductors are connected to form a circuit. In modern artificial intelligence, we have neural networks, which connect many artificial neurons to process information — in some ways, similar to how biological neurons communicate through electrical signals in our nervous system.

Today, we’ll start with the more classic engineering example: the electrical network.
