Once we know how to combine impedances into a single equivalent value, we can simplify any branch of a network. Each branch can then be treated as just two things: an impedance and a source — either a voltage source, a current source, or both. If there are more components in the branch, we simply combine them into one equivalent impedance before solving.

After that, solving the network becomes a two-step process:Step one: find the overall currents and voltages using the simplified equivalent impedances.Step two, if needed, break the equivalent impedance back into its original components and distribute the results to each part.

Now let’s apply this to the idea of a voltage divider. In the circuit on the left, we have an input voltage split between a resistor and a capacitor. The fraction of the input voltage that appears across the capacitor is given by the transfer function:
“Capital T of omega equals one divided by j omega C, all over R plus one divided by j omega C.”
If we simplify, that becomes:“T of omega equals one over one plus j times omega over omega sub c,”where omega sub c equals one over R times C.

This formula tells us how the circuit responds to different frequencies. If the input is a pure sinusoidal wave, we just plug its frequency into omega and get the scaling factor for the output.
And if the input is an arbitrary waveform, Fourier analysis lets us break it into many sinusoidal components, each with its own frequency. 

We apply the transfer function to each frequency separately, then sum them back up to get the total output.
This particular circuit is called a low-pass filter because it passes low-frequency signals with little attenuation, but strongly reduces high-frequency components. At very low frequencies, omega is close to zero, so the transfer function is close to one — the output nearly matches the input. At very high frequencies, omega is large, the transfer function becomes very small, and the output is greatly reduced.

The inductor–resistor version on the right works the same way, except its cutoff frequency omega sub c equals R divided by L.
