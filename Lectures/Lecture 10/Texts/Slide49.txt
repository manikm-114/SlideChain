So here, you can see that all of these relationships are brought together in one poster.

Some of the diagrams—like the one we have here—actually exist in several different published versions. In this case, I’ve redrawn the figure myself to avoid any copyright issues.

For a classroom lecture, using the original version is generally fine. But if you eventually want to publish your work, you either need to get formal permission to use those copyrighted figures or you should redraw them in your own style so they’re fully original.
