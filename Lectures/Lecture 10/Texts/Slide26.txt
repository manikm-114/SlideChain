Up to now, we’ve looked at components that behave in a linear way — resistors, capacitors, and inductors — all of which follow the generalized Ohm’s Law, voltage equals impedance times current.

But many real-world circuit elements are nonlinear components. Their voltage–current relationship does not form a straight line.
For example, a diode only allows significant current to flow in one direction once the forward voltage reaches a certain threshold — about 0.7 volts for silicon and 0.3 volts for germanium. In reverse bias, very little current flows until breakdown occurs.
Transistors, such as the NPN bipolar junction transistor shown here, can amplify signals. By carefully biasing the base–emitter junction, a small change in base current controls a much larger change in collector current. This allows weak input signals to be amplified into stronger output signals.

We also have digital logic gates — OR, AND, XOR, NOR, NAND, and NOT — which are the building blocks of digital electronics. They process binary signals, producing specific outputs based on logical rules. By combining these gates, we can create flip-flops and sequential circuits, which store and manipulate digital information.

Nonlinear components make it possible to build amplifiers, oscillators, logic circuits, and microprocessors. They open the door to modern electronics — where linear analysis still plays a role, but must be combined with device-specific nonlinear behavior.
