Up to now, we’ve talked about resistors, capacitors, and inductors separately. Each has its own voltage–current relationship, and each can be expressed in the phasor domain.

Instead of calling all these effects “resistance,” we use a broader term — impedance. Impedance describes how any circuit element opposes the flow of alternating current, and it applies to all three components.
For a resistor, impedance is simply R.For a capacitor, impedance is 1 over j omega C.For an inductor, impedance is j omega L.
In each case, impedance is defined as voltage divided by current — Z equals V over I. This is the same structure as Ohm’s Law, but with Z taking the place of R.

When we combine components in a circuit, the total impedance depends on whether they are connected in series or in parallel. Later, we’ll learn how to calculate equivalent impedance for these different configurations. But the important takeaway here is that impedance unifies the behavior of resistors, capacitors, and inductors into one general concept, making AC circuit analysis much simpler.
