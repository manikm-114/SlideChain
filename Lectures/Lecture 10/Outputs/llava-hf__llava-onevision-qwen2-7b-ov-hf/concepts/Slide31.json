From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nOperational amplifiers can be connected in many different configurations, each producing a specific function.\n\nHere you see several common modules:\nA non-inverting amplifier, where the gain equals one plus the ratio of R2 over R1.\nAn inverting amplifier, where the gain equals negative R2 over R1.\nA differentiator, which produces an output proportional to the rate of change of the input signal.\nAn integrator, which produces an output proportional to the time integral of the input signal.\nA differential amplifier, which amplifies the difference between two input signals.\nAll of these can be analyzed using the same two op amp rules we discussed earlier: the inputs are at the same voltage, and no current flows into the input terminals.\n\nWhile the details of each configuration can get more involved, for our purposes, it’s enough to understand the fundamental idea: by choosing how we connect resistors, capacitors, and feedback paths, we can make the op amp perform a wide range of analog signal processing tasks.\n\nIf you’re interested in the full derivations and formulas, the linked reference has complete explanations — but for this class, understanding the basic concepts is sufficient.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"Operational Amplifier\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"Non-Inverting Amplifier\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"Inverting Amplifier\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"Differentiator\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"Integrator\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"Differential Amplifier\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"Resistors\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"Capacitors\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"Feedback Paths\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"Operational Amplifiers\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"Signal Processing Tasks\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"Operational amplifiers can be connected in many different configurations, each producing a specific function.\", \"All of these can be analyzed using the same two op amp rules we discussed earlier: the inputs are at the same voltage, and no current flows into the input terminals.\"]\n}\n```",
