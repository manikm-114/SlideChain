From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThe first rule we use in circuit analysis is Kirchhoff’s Current Law, or KCL. It’s very straightforward: for any node in a circuit, the total current flowing into the node must equal the total current flowing out.\n\nThink of the node as a junction — electrons flow in from some branches and out through others. They don’t pile up or vanish at the node. If two amperes flow in from one branch and three amperes flow in from another, then a total of five amperes must flow out through the remaining branch.\nYou can picture this like people moving through a doorway: the number of people entering must match the number leaving, assuming no one stays inside the doorway. Or like cars passing through an intersection: cars can’t just appear or disappear; what comes in must go out.\n\nKCL is essentially a statement of conservation of charge — charge is neither created nor destroyed at a node. This simple but powerful rule will be one of the main tools we use to solve circuit equations.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"Kirchhoff’s Current Law\", \"category\": \"physics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"node\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"current\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"charge\", \"category\": \"physics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"conservation\", \"category\": \"physics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"circuit\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"equations\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"The first rule we use in circuit analysis is Kirchhoff’s Current Law, or KCL.
