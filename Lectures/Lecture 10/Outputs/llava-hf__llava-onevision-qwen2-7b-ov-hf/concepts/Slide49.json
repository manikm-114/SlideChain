From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo here, you can see that all of these relationships are brought together in one poster.\n\nSome of the diagrams—like the one we have here—actually exist in several different published versions. In this case, I’ve redrawn the figure myself to avoid any copyright issues.\n\nFor a classroom lecture, using the original version is generally fine. But if you eventually want to publish your work, you either need to get formal permission to use those copyrighted figures or you should redraw them in your own style so they’re fully original.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"redraw\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"copyright\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"publish\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"publish\", \"category\": \"workflow\"},\n    {\"term\": \"publish\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"publish\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"publish\", \"category\": \"frequency_domain\"},\n    {\"term\": \"publish\", \"category\": \"physics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"publish\", \"category\": \"instrumentation\"},\n    {\"term\": \"publish\", \"category\": \"data_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"publish\", \"category\": \"reconstruction\"},\n    {\"term\": \"publish\", \"category\": \"quality_metric\"},\n    {\"term\": \"publish\", \"category\": \"communication\"},\n    {\"term\": \"publish\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"publish\", \"category\": \"anatomy\"},\n    {\"term\": \"publish\", \"category\": \"algorithm\"},\n    {\"term\": \"publish\", \"category\": \"ai_ml\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"In this case, I’ve",
