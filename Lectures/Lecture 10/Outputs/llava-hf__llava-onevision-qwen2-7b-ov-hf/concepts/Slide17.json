From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nIf you start with the simplest case — a single loop — the problem is straightforward. You can solve it directly, just like using Ohm’s Law: voltage equals impedance times current.\n\nAs you make the network more complex, you can add loops, nodes, or both. Each time you add a loop, you introduce a new unknown, but KVL gives you one more independent equation to match it. Each time you add a node, you also introduce a new unknown; however, KCL provides the additional equation needed.\n\nIf you add both a node and a loop at the same time, you introduce two unknowns — for example, splitting a branch into two paths so currents can differ — but you also gain two equations: one from KCL at the new node and one from KVL around the new loop.\nThe key point is that no matter how you expand the network, KCL and KVL together give you exactly the number of independent equations you need to solve for all the unknown currents and voltages. This balance is what ensures that a well-defined electrical network always has a unique solution.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
