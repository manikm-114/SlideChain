From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAs we just discussed, we often want three things in a circuit:\nvery high input resistance,\nvery low output resistance,\nand a large gain or magnification factor.\nThe operational amplifier — or op amp — delivers exactly that.\n\nInside an op amp are many transistors and other components, all arranged to meet these requirements. The internal circuitry can look complicated, but for analysis, we can use a simple model:\nWe apply a small input voltage, V in, between the non-inverting and inverting inputs. The op amp multiplies this by a large gain factor, G, to produce the output voltage, V out equals G times V in.\nIn the ideal model:\nThe gain is infinitely large.\n\nThe input impedance is infinite, so the op amp doesn’t draw current from the source — we capture the full signal.\nThe output impedance is zero, so the op amp can drive the next stage without loss.\nReal op amps don’t reach these ideal values, but they can come close — for example, input impedance in the megaohm to teraohm range, and output impedance as low as a few hundred ohms.\n\nAn op amp is an active component — it needs its own power supply, typically labeled V S plus and V S minus. This internal power lets it amplify signals, something passive components like resistors, capacitors, and inductors cannot do on their own.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
