Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s start with the most basic electrical component — the resistor.\u000b\nYou already know Ohm’s Law, which tells us that the voltage across a resistor equals the current flowing through it multiplied by its resistance. In words,\u000bv equals i times R.\nWe can also rearrange this to say that the current i equals the voltage v divided by the resistance R.\u000bThis means the current is directly proportional to the applied voltage and inversely proportional to the resistance.\nThe name resistor comes from its function — it resists the flow of electric current. In other words, it limits how many electrons can pass through it for a given voltage.\n\nNext, we’ll move on to another fundamental component — the capacitor.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"resistor\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"electric current\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"In words, v equals i times R.
