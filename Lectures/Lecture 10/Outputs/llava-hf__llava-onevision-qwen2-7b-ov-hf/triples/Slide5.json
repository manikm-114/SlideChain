Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere we have the capacitor — another fundamental circuit component.\u000b\nWhen we connect a voltage source, such as a battery, across the capacitor, electrons are pushed toward one plate, creating a buildup of negative charge. On the opposite plate, a positive charge accumulates. Importantly, the capacitor itself doesn’t let electrons pass directly through; instead, the charges stay separated by an insulating material called the dielectric.\nAs more charge accumulates, an opposing electric field develops across the plates. Eventually, this field balances the applied voltage, and the current flow stops.\n\nMathematically, the relationship between voltage and current for a capacitor is given by:\u000bI equals C times the derivative of v with respect to time.\u000bIn words, the current is proportional to how quickly the voltage changes over time.\u000bWe can also write it in integral form:\u000bv equals one over C times the integral of i with respect to time, plus the initial voltage.\n\nThis is different from a resistor, where voltage and current are simply proportional. For a capacitor, the key is the rate of voltage change — no change in voltage means no current flows.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
