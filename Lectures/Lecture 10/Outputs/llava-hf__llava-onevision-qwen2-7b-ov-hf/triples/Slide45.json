Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nOnce we define a loss function — the measure of difference between the network’s output and the ground truth — our goal is to reduce that difference step by step. We do this by adjusting the network’s parameters in a way that moves us downhill on the loss surface.\n\nYou can imagine this process like standing on a hilly landscape and trying to reach the lowest valley. At each step, we look around, find the steepest downward direction, and take a small move in that direction. This is the essence of gradient descent.\nOver time, with each update, the loss gets smaller and smaller until the network converges to a good solution — ideally, a point where further changes no longer improve the performance.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"loss function\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"network’s output\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"Once we define a loss function — the measure of difference between the network’s output and the ground truth — our goal is to reduce that difference step by step.\"}\n  ]\n}",
