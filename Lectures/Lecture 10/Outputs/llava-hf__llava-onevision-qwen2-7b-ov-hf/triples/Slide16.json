Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThe second key rule is Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law, or KVL. It states that if you travel around any closed loop in a circuit, the sum of all the voltage rises and drops must equal zero.\n\nYou can think of it like taking a hike around a loop trail that starts and ends at the same place. Along the way, you might climb uphill — that’s like a voltage rise from a battery — and you might walk downhill — that’s like a voltage drop across a resistor. By the time you return to where you started, your total elevation change is zero.\nIn a circuit, it’s the same idea but with electrical potential instead of gravitational potential. As electrons move through a voltage source, they gain energy; as they pass through resistive elements, they lose energy. Around a complete loop, the total gains and losses cancel out exactly — a direct consequence of energy conservation.\n\nIn this example, the voltage source V 1 is 10 volts. As we move around the loop, we see drops of 2 volts, 3 volts, and 1 volt across different resistors, and zero volts across the ideal conducting wire. That leaves one resistor with an unknown drop. To satisfy KVL, it must drop 4 volts so that the algebraic sum is zero.\nWhen we combine KVL with Kirchhoff’s Current Law, we can write enough equations to solve for all the unknown currents and voltages in even a complex electrical network.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
