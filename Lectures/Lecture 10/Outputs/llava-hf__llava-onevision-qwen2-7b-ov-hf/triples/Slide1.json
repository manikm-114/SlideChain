Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nGood afternoon, everyone. Today, we begin Lecture 10, which focuses on networks.\u000b\nBefore we dive into the details, let me remind you that this topic builds directly on what we’ve covered in linear systems and Fourier analysis. If you haven’t reviewed those concepts recently, now would be a great time to revisit them, because they’ll help you see the deeper connections between the theory and the applications we’ll explore today.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"networks\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"linear systems and Fourier analysis\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"If you haven’t reviewed those concepts recently, now would be a great time to revisit them, because they’ll help you see the deeper connections between the theory and the applications we’ll explore today.\"}\n  ]\n}",
