Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThe day after our own symposium, I found myself free for the afternoon, so I decided to attend another session titled The Technology of Artificial Intelligence. It was led by Demis Hassabis, the co-founder and CEO of DeepMind — one of the world’s leading AI companies, later acquired by Google.\n\nI listened to several fascinating presentations. The speakers shared breakthroughs in AI research, from neuroscience-inspired architectures to game-playing systems that were pushing the limits of machine learning. The atmosphere was electric — you could feel that this was more than just incremental progress.\n\nThat afternoon convinced me of something important: AI had truly entered a revolutionary stage. The technology was no longer just an academic curiosity; it was becoming a powerful tool with transformative potential, ready to impact science, healthcare, and our understanding of the human mind. It was clear that an exciting new era was unfolding.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"Demis Hassabis\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"DeepMind\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"co-founder and CEO of DeepMind\"}\n  ]\n}",
