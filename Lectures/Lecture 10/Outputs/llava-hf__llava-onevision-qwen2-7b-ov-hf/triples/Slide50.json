  "raw_output": "user \nSystem:\nYou are extracting factual relations from a medical imaging lecture. Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nFor your homework, I’d like you to work through this sensitivity analysis problem.\n\nThe idea is to determine how to choose the resistor values so that the circuit’s sensitivity is as high as possible. Sensitivity here is defined as the derivative of V out​ with respect to x, where x represents a small fractional change in the sensor resistance.\nIn other words, if x changes just a little, we want V out​ to change as much as possible. That’s what we mean by “high sensitivity.”\n\nYou’ll be able to adjust both R L​ and R S​. If you work through the math, you’ll find that the sensitivity reaches its maximum when the two resistances are equal.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"sensitivity\", \"p\":\"measures\",\n     \"o\":\"derivative of V out with respect to x\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"Sensitivity here is defined as the derivative of V out with respect to x, where x represents a small fractional change in the sensor resistance.\"}\n  ]\n}",
