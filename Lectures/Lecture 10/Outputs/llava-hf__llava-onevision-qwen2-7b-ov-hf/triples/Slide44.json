Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nOnce you understand the concepts, you might want to try them out in practice. MATLAB now offers a Machine Learning Toolbox — a powerful package that helps you perform parameter optimization, data clustering, and pattern recognition.\nWith this toolbox, you can access a variety of ready-made functions for tasks like feature extraction, classification, and regression. It also comes with tutorials, application notes, and built-in demos, so you can learn by experimenting.\n\nFor example, you can try leaf recognition, fingerprint detection, or even music genre classification — all with the same framework. The advantage is that you don’t have to start coding everything from scratch. Instead, you can focus on understanding the algorithms, adjusting parameters, and seeing how those changes affect performance.\n\nThis makes it an excellent platform for quickly testing ideas, prototyping solutions, and getting a feel for how machine learning techniques behave with real data.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"MATLAB\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"Machine Learning Toolbox\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"MATLAB now offers a Machine Learning Toolbox — a powerful package that helps you perform parameter optimization, data clustering, and pattern recognition.\"}\n  ]\n}",
