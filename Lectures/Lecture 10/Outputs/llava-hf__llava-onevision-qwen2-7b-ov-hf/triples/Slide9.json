Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s see how phase, or phasor, representation applies directly to a capacitor’s voltage–current relationship.\nIn basic DC circuits, Ohm’s Law tells us that voltage equals current times resistance. But for a capacitor, we normally describe the relationship in terms of a derivative or an integral — for example, i equals C times dv over dt.\n\nHowever, when we work in the phasor domain, something elegant happens. The derivative operation in the time domain becomes a simple multiplication by j omega in the frequency domain. This means that, for sinusoidal signals, the voltage–current relationship for a capacitor can look just like Ohm’s Law — except that instead of a real resistance, we have a complex quantity called impedance.\nHere’s the key point: in any linear circuit made up of resistors, capacitors, and inductors, if we drive it with a pure sinusoidal signal, the output will also be a sinusoid at the exact same frequency. The amplitude may change, and the waveform may shift in phase, but the frequency remains unchanged.\n\nFor example, suppose the voltage across a capacitor is A cosine omega t. Differentiating this to find the current shifts the waveform by 90 degrees and multiplies its amplitude by C omega. In phasor notation, this phase shift is written as “at an angle of + 90 degrees.”\nFinally, in the phasor domain, the capacitor’s impedance is 1 over j omega C. That’s directly analogous to resistance in Ohm’s Law — except here it’s a complex value, reflecting the fact that voltage and current are out of phase.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
