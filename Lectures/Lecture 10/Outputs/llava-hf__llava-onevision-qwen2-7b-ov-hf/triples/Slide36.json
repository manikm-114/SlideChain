Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere, we see the structure of a biological neuron — the basic building block of the nervous system.\n\nA neuron has several main parts. The dendrites act like antennas, receiving incoming signals from other neurons. These signals travel toward the cell body, which contains the nucleus and all the essential cellular machinery to keep the neuron alive and functioning.\nFrom the cell body, information is sent down a long projection called the axon. This is essentially the neuron’s transmission cable, carrying electrical signals — known as action potentials — toward the axon terminals. Along the way, the signal may be sped up by segments of myelin sheath, which act as insulation.\n\nAt the axon terminals, the neuron communicates with its target cells — which could be other neurons, muscle fibers, or glands — across small gaps called synapses. Communication here happens chemically, through the release of neurotransmitters, or in some cases, electrically.\n\nThe important thing to remember is that neurons are not just passive wires. They integrate inputs, make decisions about whether to fire, and adapt over time. This biological model is what inspired the design of artificial neural networks in machine learning.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"neuron\", \"p\":\"uses\", \"o\":\"dendrites\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"receiving incoming signals from other neurons\"}\n  ]\n}",
