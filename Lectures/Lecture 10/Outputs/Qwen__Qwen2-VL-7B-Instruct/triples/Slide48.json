Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nBefore we close, let me show you a roadmap that pulls together the foundational ideas we’ve been discussing.\n\nThis diagram is a kind of “big picture” for the mathematical and engineering concepts underlying modern imaging and machine learning. It includes complex numbers, Fourier transforms, convolution, and sampling theory — all of which form the language we use to describe signals and images.\n\nYou can see how these elements connect: from basic mathematics like Euler’s formula, to signal operations such as convolution and correlation, to the Fourier series and transforms that let us work in the frequency domain. We also have system models from electrical engineering, like impedance and circuit laws, and finally, neural network building blocks — showing how the same principles extend into modern AI.\n\nThink of this as your conceptual map. Each box here represents a tool in your toolbox, and together, they form the foundation for advanced methods in imaging, machine learning, and beyond.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
