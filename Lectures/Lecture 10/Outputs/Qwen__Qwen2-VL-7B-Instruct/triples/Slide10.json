Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nFor an inductor, the process is very similar to what we saw with a capacitor, but here it’s the current that we start with.\n\nSuppose the current is sinusoidal: B cosine omega t. The voltage across the inductor is given by v equals L times di/dt. Differentiating the current shifts the waveform by 90 degrees and changes the amplitude by a factor of L omega.\nIn phasor notation, if the current is B at angle 0 degrees, then the voltage becomes L omega B at angle 90 degrees. That phase shift means the voltage leads the current by 90 degrees in an inductor — the exact opposite of a capacitor, where the current leads the voltage by 90 degrees.\n\nIn the phasor domain, this relationship is written simply as V equals j omega L times I. Here, j omega L plays the same role for an inductor that resistance R plays for a resistor — it’s the impedance. The only difference is that it’s a complex quantity, reflecting the phase relationship between voltage and current.\n\nSo once again, phasor notation allows us to generalize Ohm’s Law to all three basic components — resistor, capacitor, and inductor — using the single idea of impedance.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
