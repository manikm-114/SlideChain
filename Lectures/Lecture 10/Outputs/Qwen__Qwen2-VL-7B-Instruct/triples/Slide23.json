Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nIn this sense, an alternating current circuit can be treated just like a direct current circuit — once we use phasor notation and impedance. That’s why we say AC is DC in disguise.\n\nBy representing AC voltages and currents as phasors, we turn differential equations into simple algebraic ones, just like in DC analysis. This dramatically simplifies the process of solving AC circuit problems.\nThis clever idea was first developed decades ago by an engineer at the GE Global Research Center, not far from here. It’s now a standard computational tool in electrical engineering, and it’s one of the reasons AC circuit analysis can be so elegant.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
