From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nJust as we can have linear systems and nonlinear systems, we also have nonlinear electronic components.\n\nOne of the most fundamental is the diode. A diode has a strong directional preference for current flow. In its forward direction, the current rises rapidly after a certain threshold voltage — about 0.7 volts for silicon. In the reverse direction, the current is extremely small until breakdown occurs. This is a clearly nonlinear voltage–current relationship.\n\nIf we combine two diodes in a specific configuration, we create a transistor. A transistor takes a small signal at its input and produces a much larger version of the same signal shape at its output — it acts as an amplifier. This ability to magnify weak signals makes the transistor an essential building block for electronics.\n\nMultiple transistors can be combined to perform logic operations. For example, an AND gate outputs a high voltage only if both inputs are high. An OR gate outputs a high voltage if either input is high. More complex gates, like NAND, NOR, and XOR, can be built from these basic ideas.\nBy connecting logic gates, we can create circuits that add, multiply, store data, and make decisions — the very basis of digital computers.\n\nThis is why in electronics we need to understand both linear and nonlinear systems. Linear components handle predictable analog relationships, while nonlinear components give us amplification, switching, and the foundation for all digital processing.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
