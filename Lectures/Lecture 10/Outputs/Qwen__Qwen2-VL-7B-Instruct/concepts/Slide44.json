From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nOnce you understand the concepts, you might want to try them out in practice. MATLAB now offers a Machine Learning Toolbox — a powerful package that helps you perform parameter optimization, data clustering, and pattern recognition.\nWith this toolbox, you can access a variety of ready-made functions for tasks like feature extraction, classification, and regression. It also comes with tutorials, application notes, and built-in demos, so you can learn by experimenting.\n\nFor example, you can try leaf recognition, fingerprint detection, or even music genre classification — all with the same framework. The advantage is that you don’t have to start coding everything from scratch. Instead, you can focus on understanding the algorithms, adjusting parameters, and seeing how those changes affect performance.\n\nThis makes it an excellent platform for quickly testing ideas, prototyping solutions, and getting a feel for how machine learning techniques behave with real data.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Reject filler or administrative text.\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"Machine Learning Toolbox\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"feature extraction\", \"category\": \"algorithm\"},\n    {\"term\": \"classification\", \"category\": \"algorithm\"},\n    {\"term\": \"regression\", \"category\": \"algorithm\"},\n    {\"term\": \"leaf recognition\", \"category\": \"algorithm\"},\n    {\"term\": \"fingerprint detection\", \"category\": \"algorithm\"},\n    {\"term\": \"music genre classification\", \"category\": \"algorithm\"},\n    {\"term\": \"optimization\", \"category\": \"algorithm\"},\n    {\"term\": \"data clustering\", \"category\": \"algorithm\"},\n    {\"term\": \"pattern recognition\", \"category\": \"algorithm\"},\n    {\"term\": \"prototyping\", \"category\": \"workflow\"},\n    {\"term\": \"real data\", \"category\": \"data_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"machine learning techniques\", \"category\": \"algorithm\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\n    \"MATLAB now offers a Machine Learning Toolbox — a powerful package that helps you perform parameter optimization, data clustering, and pattern recognition.\",\n    \"With this toolbox, you can access a variety of ready-made functions for tasks like feature extraction, classification, and regression.\",",
