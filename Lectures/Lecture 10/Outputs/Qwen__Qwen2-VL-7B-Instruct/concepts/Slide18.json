From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s solve this example step by step.\n\nWe have two voltage sources and two loops. Our goal is to find three unknown currents:\nI 1, which flows through the left loop,\nI 2, which flows through the right loop,\nand I₃, which flows along the bottom branch.\nFirst, we apply Kirchhoff’s Current Law at node c. In words, the current I 1 flowing into the node plus the current I 2 flowing into the node must equal the current I₃ flowing out. That’s our first equation:\u000b“I one plus I two equals I three.”\n\nNext, we apply Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law to the green loop, moving clockwise through points b, e, f, c, and back to b. As we go around the loop:\npassing through the fourteen-volt battery in the opposite direction gives a minus fourteen volts,\npassing through the ten-volt battery in the opposite direction gives minus ten volts,\npassing through the six-ohm resistor with current I 1 gives plus six times I 1,\nand passing through the four-ohm resistor with current I 2 gives minus four times I 2.\n\nAdding them all up and setting the total to zero, we have:\u000b“negative fourteen, minus ten, plus six times I one, minus four times I two, equals zero.”\nFinally, we apply Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law to the blue loop, moving through points a, b, c, d, and back to a. This gives:\u000b“ten, minus six times I one, minus two times I three, equals zero.”\n\nNow we have three equations:\nI one plus I two equals I three.\nNegative fourteen minus ten plus six I one minus four I two equals zero.\nTen minus six I one minus two I three equals zero.\n\nSolving these, we find:\u000bI one equals two amperes,\u000bI two equals negative three amperes — meaning it actually flows in the opposite direction we assumed —\u000band I three equals negative one ampere.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
