From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nUp to now, we’ve looked at components that behave in a linear way — resistors, capacitors, and inductors — all of which follow the generalized Ohm’s Law, voltage equals impedance times current.\n\nBut many real-world circuit elements are nonlinear components. Their voltage–current relationship does not form a straight line.\nFor example, a diode only allows significant current to flow in one direction once the forward voltage reaches a certain threshold — about 0.7 volts for silicon and 0.3 volts for germanium. In reverse bias, very little current flows until breakdown occurs.\nTransistors, such as the NPN bipolar junction transistor shown here, can amplify signals. By carefully biasing the base–emitter junction, a small change in base current controls a much larger change in collector current. This allows weak input signals to be amplified into stronger output signals.\n\nWe also have digital logic gates — OR, AND, XOR, NOR, NAND, and NOT — which are the building blocks of digital electronics. They process binary signals, producing specific outputs based on logical rules. By combining these gates, we can create flip-flops and sequential circuits, which store and manipulate digital information.\n\nNonlinear components make it possible to build amplifiers, oscillators, logic circuits, and microprocessors. They open the door to modern electronics — where linear analysis still plays a role, but must be combined with device-specific nonlinear behavior.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
