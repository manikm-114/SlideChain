From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s look at this inverting amplifier and walk through the analysis step-by-step using our two op amp rules.\n\nFirst, the non-inverting input is connected to ground.\u000bBy rule one, the inverting input is also at zero volts — that’s our virtual ground.\nBy rule two, no current flows into the op amp input.\u000bThat means all the current coming through the input resistor R-i from the input voltage must flow through the feedback resistor R-f to the output.\n\nNow, the current through R-i equals the input voltage minus zero, divided by R-i.\u000bThe current through R-f equals zero minus the output voltage, divided by R-f.\n\nSince these currents are the same, we can say:\u000bInput voltage divided by R-i equals negative output voltage divided by R-f.\nIf we multiply both sides by R-f, we get:\u000bOutput voltage equals negative R-f over R-i, times the input voltage.\nThe negative sign means the output is inverted compared to the input.\u000bThe size of the gain is the value of R-f divided by the value of R-i.\n\nSo, with just those two op amp rules, we can find the input–output relationship without worrying about the op amp’s internal complexity.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
