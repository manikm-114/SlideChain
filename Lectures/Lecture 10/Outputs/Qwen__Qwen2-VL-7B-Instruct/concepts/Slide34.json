From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThe day after our own symposium, I found myself free for the afternoon, so I decided to attend another session titled The Technology of Artificial Intelligence. It was led by Demis Hassabis, the co-founder and CEO of DeepMind — one of the world’s leading AI companies, later acquired by Google.\n\nI listened to several fascinating presentations. The speakers shared breakthroughs in AI research, from neuroscience-inspired architectures to game-playing systems that were pushing the limits of machine learning. The atmosphere was electric — you could feel that this was more than just incremental progress.\n\nThat afternoon convinced me of something important: AI had truly entered a revolutionary stage. The technology was no longer just an academic curiosity; it was becoming a powerful tool with transformative potential, ready to impact science, healthcare, and our understanding of the human mind. It was clear that an exciting new era was unfolding.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
