From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nGood afternoon, everyone. Today, we begin Lecture 10, which focuses on networks.\u000b\nBefore we dive into the details, let me remind you that this topic builds directly on what we’ve covered in linear systems and Fourier analysis. If you haven’t reviewed those concepts recently, now would be a great time to revisit them, because they’ll help you see the deeper connections between the theory and the applications we’ll explore today.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
