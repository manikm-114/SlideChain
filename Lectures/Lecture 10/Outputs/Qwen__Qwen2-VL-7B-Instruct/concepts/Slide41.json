From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nOnce you have the basic idea of how a neural network works, you can imagine that there’s no single way to connect the neurons. In fact, researchers have developed many different network topologies, each suited for specific tasks.\n\nHere in this chart, you can see a variety of examples.\nAt the simplest level, we have the perceptron and feed-forward networks, where information flows in one direction from input to output.\nThen there are radial basis networks and more specialized architectures like recurrent neural networks or RNNs, which loop information back so the network can remember past inputs.\nLong Short-Term Memory networks — LSTMs — and Gated Recurrent Units, or GRUs, are powerful variants for processing sequences, such as speech or time-series data.\n\nOther designs, like autoencoders and variational autoencoders, are used for compressing data and then reconstructing it, often to find hidden patterns or generate new examples.\nYou also see Boltzmann machines, Hopfield networks, and deep belief networks, which are useful for certain types of learning and pattern recognition.\n\nThe key point is that these different architectures are like tools in a toolbox. Some are better for images, some for language, some for prediction over time. Once you understand the fundamentals — inputs, weights, activation functions, and training — all these variations are just different ways of wiring those same building blocks together.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
