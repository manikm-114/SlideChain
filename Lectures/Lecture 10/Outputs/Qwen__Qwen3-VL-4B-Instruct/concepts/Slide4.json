From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s start with the most basic electrical component — the resistor.\u000b\nYou already know Ohm’s Law, which tells us that the voltage across a resistor equals the current flowing through it multiplied by its resistance. In words,\u000bv equals i times R.\nWe can also rearrange this to say that the current i equals the voltage v divided by the resistance R.\u000bThis means the current is directly proportional to the applied voltage and inversely proportional to the resistance.\nThe name resistor comes from its function — it resists the flow of electric current. In other words, it limits how many electrons can pass through it for a given voltage.\n\nNext, we’ll move on to another fundamental component — the capacitor.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
