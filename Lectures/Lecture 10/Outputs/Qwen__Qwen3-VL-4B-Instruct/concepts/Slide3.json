From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nBefore we dive into networks, let’s recall the two related ideas we’ve already discussed — functions and systems.\u000b\nA function is a mathematical concept. It takes an input, processes it according to some rule, and produces an output. You can think of it in terms of a domain and a range.\u000bA system is essentially the same idea, but we often use this term in engineering. We talk about inputs and outputs, and the system could be simple or complex.\n\nNow, a network is really just a more complex kind of system — one made up of many interconnected subsystems. The internet is a perfect example: millions of computers linked together, exchanging information. From a mathematical perspective, you can think of a network as a very complicated function, often involving many variables and composite functions linked together.\n\nIn electrical engineering, we often study electrical networks, where components like resistors, capacitors, and inductors are connected to form a circuit. In modern artificial intelligence, we have neural networks, which connect many artificial neurons to process information — in some ways, similar to how biological neurons communicate through electrical signals in our nervous system.\n\nToday, we’ll start with the more classic engineering example: the electrical network.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
