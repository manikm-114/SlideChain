From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s learn how to replace two impedances with a single equivalent impedance.\n\nSeries connection — one after the other on the same branch:\u000bThe same current flows through both, and the voltage drops add.\u000b\nSo the equivalent is:\u000b“Z sub e equals Z one plus Z two.”\u000bThis works even when the impedances are complex.\nA one-line proof, spoken: assume a current I flows.\u000bThe total voltage is I times Z sub e.\u000bIt is also I times Z one plus I times Z two.\u000bSet them equal and cancel I: “Z sub e equals Z one plus Z two.”\nParallel connection — the two elements share the same two nodes:\u000bThe voltage across each is the same, and the currents add.\u000b\nSo the equivalent is:\u000b“one over Z sub e equals one over Z one plus one over Z two,”\u000bor, equivalently,\u000b“Z sub e equals Z one times Z two, divided by Z one plus Z two.”\nQuick proof, spoken: let the common voltage be V.\u000bCurrents are I 1 = V over Z 1 and I 2 = V over Z 2.\u000bTotal current I = I 1 plus I 2 = V times (1 over Z 1 plus 1 over Z 2).\u000bBut I = V over Z sub e.\u000bCancel V to get the reciprocal form above.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
