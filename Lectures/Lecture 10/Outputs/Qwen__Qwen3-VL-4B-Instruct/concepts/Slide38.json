From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, here is the simplest way to think about it.\n\nAt the top, you see a biological neuron. It receives input through many branches, called dendrites. All of these signals are gathered in the main cell body, the soma. If the combined signal is strong enough, the neuron generates an electrical pulse that travels down the axon. Finally, it reaches the output interface — the synapse — where it passes the signal on to other neurons.\nBelow that is the mathematical model we use for an artificial neuron. Each input is represented as a variable, and not all inputs carry the same importance, so we assign a weight to each one. Larger weights mean that input has a bigger influence; smaller weights mean less influence.\n\nThe neuron first performs a linear operation — a weighted sum of all the inputs, which is essentially an inner product. But that’s not enough. Just like in biology, small random fluctuations — small “nudges” — are ignored. Only when the total input crosses a certain threshold does the neuron respond strongly. This is where the nonlinear transformation comes in, producing the actual output.\nSo, in short: first we sum the inputs in a weighted way, then we pass the result through a nonlinear function that decides whether to respond — and how strongly.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
