From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere’s a very typical and practical circuit — the voltage divider.\nWe start with an input voltage, which is split between two resistors or impedances, R 1 and R 2. The voltage drop across the second resistor becomes our output signal. This is a common way to pass a signal from one stage of a system to the next.\n\nA real-world example might be a sensor connected to a measurement device. The human body, for instance, has its own electrical impedance. If we were measuring a cardiac signal, we could model the body’s impedance as R 1. The second resistor, R 2, could represent the input impedance of our measuring instrument.\n\nFrom an engineering perspective, we usually have three goals when designing such a circuit:\nLarge input resistance — We want R1 to be large so that most of the input voltage appears across it, ensuring we capture as much of the signal as possible.\nSmall output resistance — We want R2 to be small so the next stage in the circuit can take the signal without losing much voltage.\nHigh gain — If possible, we want to amplify the signal to make it easier to detect and process.\n\nThese goals can sometimes conflict — for example, making R 1 large helps with capturing the signal, but we also want R 2 small for driving the next stage. Circuit design is about balancing these trade-offs.\nIn the example at the bottom right, R S is our sensor, whose resistance changes slightly by a factor of x in response to something like temperature or pressure. R_L is the load resistor. If x equals zero, the sensor is at its nominal value. When x changes, even by a small amount, the output voltage V out changes.\n\nMathematically, V out equals V in multiplied by the ratio R 2 over R 1 plus R 2. This is just the voltage divider rule we’ve seen before. In practice, the change in x might be very small, so the change in V out is tiny — often just a few millivolts. If we want to amplify this tiny change, we ideally remove the constant background voltage so that only the small variation gets amplified. This allows for much higher gain without overloading the system.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
