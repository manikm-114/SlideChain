From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThis slide is a summary that generalizes Ohm’s Law for alternating current circuits.\nIn direct current circuits, we know the familiar form: “voltage equals resistance times current.” In alternating current circuits, thanks to phasor notation, we can keep the same simple structure — voltage equals impedance times current — but now impedance can be a complex number, depending on the type of component.\n\nFor a resistor, impedance is simply R, and voltage and current are in phase — their peaks occur simultaneously.\nFor a capacitor, the impedance is “one divided by j omega C,” which in polar form is “one over omega C at an angle of negative ninety degrees.” This means the voltage lags the current by ninety degrees. In other words, the current reaches its peak before the voltage does.\n\nFor an inductor, the impedance is “j omega L,” or in polar form “omega L at an angle of positive ninety degrees.” This means the voltage leads the current by ninety degrees — the voltage peaks first, and the current builds up afterward.\nIf you think about it intuitively:\nAn inductor resists sudden changes in current, so when you first apply voltage, the current starts small and gradually increases.\nA capacitor resists changes in voltage, so when you first apply current, the voltage takes time to build.\n\nMathematically, we derive these results from the voltage–current relationships we saw earlier, but phasor notation makes them look just like Ohm’s Law — only with complex impedance replacing simple resistance.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
