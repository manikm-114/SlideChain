From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo, how many nodes are in this circuit? Let’s apply the definition.\n\nA node is any point where two or more branches connect. Here, all the points along this conducting path are electrically the same — the wires are ideal conductors with zero resistance — so we treat them as one single node. This first node connects resistor R 1, resistor R 2, resistor R 3, and the voltage source.\n\nThe other connection point, down here, is the second node. It ties together the lower ends of R 2 and R 3, the negative terminal of the voltage source, and the current source.\nSo even though there are multiple connection spots physically drawn, electrically, we have just two distinct nodes in this circuit.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
