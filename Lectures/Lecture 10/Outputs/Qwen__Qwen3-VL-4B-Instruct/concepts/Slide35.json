From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThat experience sparked an idea in my mind. Over the past few centuries, humanity has gone through several major transformations. We began with the Industrial Revolution — when machines took over physical labor and reshaped manufacturing, transportation, and the way we lived. Then came the Information Revolution, where computers and the internet allowed us to store, process, and share knowledge at unprecedented speed.\n\nNow, with the rise of machine learning and artificial intelligence, we are entering what I like to call the Intelligence Revolution. This is not just about automating tasks — it’s about creating machines that can learn, adapt, and make decisions, performing tasks that were once thought to be exclusively human.\n\nThis shift will influence every aspect of life — from science and medicine to education, communication, and beyond. It’s a change as profound as the revolutions before it, but one that reaches directly into the realm of thought and reasoning.\n\nWhen we look at the history of science, we can see that it has evolved through distinct paradigms over time. Thousands of years ago, science was primarily empirical. People described natural phenomena based on what they could directly observe — carefully recording patterns in nature without necessarily understanding the underlying mechanisms.\n\nA few hundred years ago, the theoretical branch emerged. This was a major leap forward: scientists began building mathematical models and generalizations, allowing them not just to describe the world, but to predict and explain it.\nIn the past few decades, we’ve added a computational branch. With powerful computers, we can now simulate complex phenomena that are impossible to test directly, exploring theories in silico before ever stepping into a laboratory.\n\nAnd today, we have entered a new era — the era of data exploration, often called eScience. Here, we unify theory, experiment, and simulation, but our driving force is data itself. Instruments and sensors capture enormous amounts of information, which is then processed by software and stored in vast databases. From there, we can apply data analytics, statistics, and increasingly, machine learning to extract patterns, features, and relationships directly from the data.\n\nThis approach — using big data and AI to uncover new knowledge — is so different that some call it the “fourth paradigm” of science. It represents a shift in thinking: instead of starting with a theory, we can sometimes let the data speak for itself.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
