Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nOperational amplifiers can be connected in many different configurations, each producing a specific function.\n\nHere you see several common modules:\nA non-inverting amplifier, where the gain equals one plus the ratio of R2 over R1.\nAn inverting amplifier, where the gain equals negative R2 over R1.\nA differentiator, which produces an output proportional to the rate of change of the input signal.\nAn integrator, which produces an output proportional to the time integral of the input signal.\nA differential amplifier, which amplifies the difference between two input signals.\nAll of these can be analyzed using the same two op amp rules we discussed earlier: the inputs are at the same voltage, and no current flows into the input terminals.\n\nWhile the details of each configuration can get more involved, for our purposes, it’s enough to understand the fundamental idea: by choosing how we connect resistors, capacitors, and feedback paths, we can make the op amp perform a wide range of analog signal processing tasks.\n\nIf you’re interested in the full derivations and formulas, the linked reference has complete explanations — but for this class, understanding the basic concepts is sufficient.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": []\n}",
