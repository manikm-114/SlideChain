Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThis is an article I wrote for IEEE Access titled A Perspective on Deep Imaging.\nAs imaging scientists, we’ve traditionally thought of images as something you start with to process or analyze. But in medical imaging, it’s the opposite — the image is the result of a long reconstruction process.\n\nWhat’s exciting is that with machine learning, we can rethink that process entirely. Instead of following the conventional pipeline step by step, we can train neural networks to directly generate high-quality images from the raw data itself. This opens the door to faster reconstructions, better image quality, and even reduced radiation dose in certain applications.\nIn short, deep learning isn’t just another tool in the box — it has the potential to transform the way we produce and interpret medical images.\n\nNow let’s look at one practical example — improving the signal-to-noise ratio in images.\nIn medical imaging, noise is inevitable. It can come from the physics of the scanner, from the patient’s movement, or from trying to keep the radiation dose low. Traditionally, we use filtering techniques to clean up an image, but these often blur fine details along with the noise.\n\nWith modern machine learning, we can do better. By training neural networks on large datasets — for example, the thousands of scans acquired every day in hospitals — the system can learn what a “clean” image should look like, without erasing important diagnostic details. Instead of throwing those routine scans away, we can use them to teach the network.\nAs a result, we can transform a noisy scan into one that is much clearer, improving both diagnostic confidence and patient safety.\nSo that’s the big picture — and we’ll wrap up here for today.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
