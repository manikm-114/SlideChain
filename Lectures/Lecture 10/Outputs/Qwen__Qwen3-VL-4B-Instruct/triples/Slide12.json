Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s now step back and look at a general electrical network. I’ll use this simple example to introduce three important terms: node, branch, and loop.\n\nA node is a point where two or more circuit components meet. These components could be resistors, capacitors, inductors, or sources like batteries and current generators. In our diagram, each place where elements connect is a node.\nA branch is a single circuit element between two nodes. You can think of it as one “arm” of the circuit, carrying current from one node to another.\nA loop is a closed path that goes through a sequence of branches and nodes without passing through any branch or node more than once. In other words, it’s a single, non-repeating path that starts and ends at the same point.\n\nUsing these definitions, you might ask: in this diagram, how many nodes are there? And how many loops? This kind of reasoning will become important when we apply Kirchhoff’s laws for circuit analysis.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
