Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo here, you can see that all of these relationships are brought together in one poster.\n\nSome of the diagrams—like the one we have here—actually exist in several different published versions. In this case, I’ve redrawn the figure myself to avoid any copyright issues.\n\nFor a classroom lecture, using the original version is generally fine. But if you eventually want to publish your work, you either need to get formal permission to use those copyrighted figures or you should redraw them in your own style so they’re fully original.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"s\": \"the figure\",\n      \"p\": \"reconstructs_with\",\n      \"o\": \"the original version\",\n      \"modalities\": [\n        \"image\"\n      ],\n      \"confidence\": 0.9,\n      \"evidence\": \"I’ve redrawn the figure myself to avoid any copyright issues.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"s\": \"the figure\",\n      \"p\": \"represents\",\n      \"o\": \"relationships brought together in one poster\",\n      \"modalities\": [\n        \"image\"\n      ],\n      \"confidence\": 0.8,\n      \"evidence\": \"So here, you can see that all of these relationships are brought together in one poster.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"s\": \"the figure\",\n      \"p\": \"represents\",\n      \"o\": \"diagrams that exist in several different published versions\",\n      \"modalities\": [\n        \"image\"\n      ],\n      \"confidence\": 0.7,\n      \"evidence\": \"Some of the diagrams—like the one we have here—actually exist in several different published versions.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
