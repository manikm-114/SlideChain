Now let’s move into the topic of radiomics, which is an exciting area in modern medical imaging.
Radiomics is all about turning images into data. Instead of relying only on what a radiologist can see with the naked eye, we extract hundreds or even thousands of quantitative features from medical images.

For example, once we outline a tumor on an image, we can study different categories of features:
Shape features tell us about the geometry — is the tumor round, irregular, or elongated?
Intensity features describe how bright or dark the pixels are, and how their distribution looks in a histogram.
Texture features capture the patterns inside the tumor, such as whether it looks smooth, coarse, or heterogeneous. These can be computed using statistical methods like gray-level co-occurrence matrices or run-length matrices.

After we collect these features, we don’t stop there. The next step is to feed them into a prediction model. This model may perform tasks like selecting the most important features, classifying patients into groups, or predicting outcomes such as how well a patient will respond to treatment.

So radiomics really bridges imaging with data science. It takes us beyond the visual impression and allows us to mine the hidden information in images, often leading to insights that are not visible to the human eye.
