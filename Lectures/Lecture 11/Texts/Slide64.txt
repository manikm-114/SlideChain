Finally, here is your homework. You will use the MATLAB code available online to compute the Structural Similarity Index, or SSIM, between two images. SSIM is a perceptual metric that compares luminance, contrast, and structure.

Your task is two-fold. First, compute SSIM for a pair of images—either the ones shown here or another pair of your choice. Second, design an example where sensitivity is 90% and specificity is 80%, and show your calculations.

This exercise is meant to reinforce your understanding of both image quality metrics and diagnostic performance measures. The due date is one week later, so please manage your time accordingly.
