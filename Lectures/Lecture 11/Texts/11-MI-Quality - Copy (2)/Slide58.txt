To make the idea of channelized observers more concrete, let me give you an example.

Here you see four channels illustrated both in the frequency domain, across the top row, and in the spatial domain, across the bottom row. Each channel acts like a filter. In the frequency domain, these filters look like concentric rings that select specific frequency ranges. When we transform them back into the spatial domain, they appear as blurred or oscillatory patterns.
Why do we do this? Because instead of trying to analyze the entire frequency spectrum all at once, we divide it into pieces. Each channel captures information from one part of the spectrum. When we apply these filters to an image, we can see how strongly the image responds to each band of frequencies.

This is very powerful because medical images contain structures at many different scales — some large and smooth, others fine and detailed. Using channels allows us to separate these scales and study them systematically.
So, these four channels are just one example, but in practice, you could design more channels depending on how much detail you want to capture.”
