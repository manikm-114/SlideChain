Now we move into the second part of our lecture: system-specific measures.

So far, we’ve discussed general mathematical ways of comparing images — measures like mean squared error, KL divergence, and SSIM. These are important, but they don’t tell the whole story, because image quality also depends heavily on the imaging system itself.
Every imaging system — whether it’s an X-ray detector, an MRI scanner, or an ultrasound probe — has its own characteristics and limitations. To assess the quality of images produced by a system, we need to look at metrics that reflect the system’s performance.

This includes measures such as:
Noise, and the related quantities signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR).
Resolution, which can be spatial, contrast, temporal, or spectral, depending on what aspect of the system we are evaluating.
And finally, artifacts, which are false or misleading structures that appear in the image because of imperfections in the imaging process.
Together, these system-specific measures tell us how good a given imaging device is at capturing and representing reality.

So let’s begin this section with one of the most important system-specific measures: the signal-to-noise ratio, or SNR.
