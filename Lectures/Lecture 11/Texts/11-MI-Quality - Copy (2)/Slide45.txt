Now let’s look at a moderate threshold setting.

This time, we shift the decision boundary slightly to the left. What happens? More of the diseased distribution now falls to the right of the threshold. That means a greater fraction of patients with the disease are correctly identified. In other words, the sensitivity increases.
But the trade-off is clear. By moving the line left, we also capture more of the non-diseased distribution in the red region. That means more healthy patients are incorrectly flagged as diseased. The false positive fraction increases.

On the ROC curve, you can see this move as a step upward — higher sensitivity — but also a step to the right — higher false positive fraction. In other words, we’ve shifted from the black cross to the yellow cross on this plot.

This “moderate” threshold represents a more balanced decision-making strategy: better at catching true cases, but at the cost of more false alarms.
