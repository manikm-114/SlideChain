We are right on schedule in our journey through this material.

If you’ve had a chance to look over the reading materials for today’s lecture, that’s great — it will make it easier to connect the ideas we cover. If not, that’s fine too.

Consistently reinforcing concepts as you go will help you develop a stronger and more intuitive grasp, especially as the material becomes more mathematically detailed
