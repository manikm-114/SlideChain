Here we see a fuzzier, more realistic version of the XOR problem. Instead of perfectly separable points, the data is noisy and overlaps. This is much closer to what we encounter in medical imaging, where disease and non-disease cases are not cleanly separated but instead distributed with overlaps.

The nonlinear classifier can still learn a curved boundary that separates the classes reasonably well. This illustrates why nonlinear observers and machine learning are crucial: they can adapt to complex, messy data, rather than relying on oversimplified linear rules.
