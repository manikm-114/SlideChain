The ideal observer, as we just discussed, requires complete statistical knowledge of the problem. But in practice, we almost never have that luxury. So, instead, we turn to simplified models.

One of the most important of these is the Hotelling Observer.
The idea is straightforward: rather than using all the complex statistics of the image, we take the image data and apply a linear template to it. In other words, we reduce the entire image into a single number — a test statistic. That number is then used to decide whether the case is more likely normal or abnormal.

The Hotelling Observer is designed to be the best possible linear observer. What does “best” mean here? It means the observer chooses its template in a way that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio — the separation between the diseased and non-diseased cases. The larger the separation, the easier the decision becomes.
This is why the Hotelling Observer is so widely studied. It strikes a balance: not as powerful as the ideal observer, but still mathematically optimal within the class of linear decision rules.

And if we don’t even want to use all the image data, we can go a step further. We might only use selected features or specific channels of the image, instead of the full dataset. That gives us the Channelized Hotelling Observer — a practical simplification that still works well in many real-world medical imaging problems.
