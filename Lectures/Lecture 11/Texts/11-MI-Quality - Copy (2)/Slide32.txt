Next, let’s look at contrast resolution, sometimes called low-contrast resolution.

This is different from the high-contrast resolution we just discussed. High-contrast resolution deals with distinguishing small, bright details — for example, two tiny dots very close together.

Contrast resolution, on the other hand, is about the ability of an imaging system to detect subtle differences in intensity. The structures may not be small — they may even be large — but if their contrast relative to the background is very low, they may be difficult to see.
In the example shown here, notice how in one image the faint circular structures stand out more clearly, while in the other they are barely visible against the noisy background. This difference reflects the system’s contrast resolution.
Clinically, this is very important. For example, in CT imaging, a tumor may look very similar in intensity to surrounding soft tissue, because both are made of similar biological material. A system with good contrast resolution allows the tumor to be detected clearly, while a noisy or lower-quality system might completely obscure it.

Beyond contrast resolution, there are two more types of resolution we should briefly mention.
Temporal resolution refers to how quickly an imaging system can capture a snapshot. A high-speed system can freeze motion — like capturing a sharp image of a beating heart. But if the acquisition is too slow, moving objects blur together. This is why, when you take a photo of a moving car with your phone, you sometimes see motion blur. In medical imaging, temporal resolution is critical for dynamic studies, such as cardiac CT or MRI.
Spectral resolution refers to the ability of a system to distinguish between different frequencies or energies. In vision, this corresponds to color perception — someone with color blindness has poor spectral resolution. In imaging systems, spectral resolution allows us to distinguish X-rays of different energies or ultrasound waves of different frequencies. Better spectral resolution means finer discrimination of subtle differences in material properties.

Finally, let’s talk about artifacts. Artifacts are false structures that appear in images but are not really there. They are “ghosts” created by limitations or mismatches in the imaging process. For example, in CT, the motion of the heart can create blurry or duplicated structures. In ultrasound, echoes may bounce back and forth and appear as multiple spots even though only one structure exists. Recognizing and understanding artifacts is critical, because they can mislead interpretation.
