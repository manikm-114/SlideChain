Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere we see a fuzzier, more realistic version of the XOR problem. Instead of perfectly separable points, the data is noisy and overlaps. This is much closer to what we encounter in medical imaging, where disease and non-disease cases are not cleanly separated but instead distributed with overlaps.\n\nThe nonlinear classifier can still learn a curved boundary that separates the classes reasonably well. This illustrates why nonlinear observers and machine learning are crucial: they can adapt to complex, messy data, rather than relying on oversimplified linear rules.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"nonlinear classifier\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"curved boundary\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"This illustrates why nonlinear observers and machine learning are crucial: they can adapt to complex, messy data, rather than relying on oversimplified linear rules.\"}\n  ]\n}",
