Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nWe are right on schedule in our journey through this material.\n\nIf you’ve had a chance to look over the reading materials for today’s lecture, that’s great — it will make it easier to connect the ideas we cover. If not, that’s fine too. I encourage you to follow along closely and take time afterward to review the main points. Consistently reinforcing concepts as you go will help you develop a stronger and more intuitive grasp, especially as the material becomes more mathematically detailed\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"material\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"reading materials\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"If you’ve had a chance to look over the reading materials for today’s lecture, that’s great — it will make it easier to connect the ideas we cover.\"}\n  ]\n}",
