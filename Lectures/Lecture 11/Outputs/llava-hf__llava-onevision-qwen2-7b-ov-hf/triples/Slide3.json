Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere you can see the textbook’s outline of Chapter Five, which I have actually moved earlier in our course. The reason is simple: once you understand the basics of image quality assessment, you can apply these ideas to almost any imaging modality.\nNo matter whether we’re talking about X-ray, CT, MRI, ultrasound, or optical imaging, the general principles remain the same. Concepts such as resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, contrast-to-noise ratio, and artifacts are universal. They may appear in different forms, but the underlying logic applies everywhere.\n\nThe good news is that this chapter is relatively easy reading compared to some of the heavier mathematical topics we’ve already tackled. The ideas are straightforward. If you follow carefully and think through the examples, you’ll see how each concept connects to real images.\n\nFor today’s lecture, I will guide you mainly through three key aspects of image quality assessment. We’ll start with general mathematical measures, then move to system-specific characteristics, and finally consider task-specific and human-observer models. This will give you a well-rounded view of what it means to evaluate image quality in practice.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"image quality assessment\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"image\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"Once you understand the basics of image quality assessment, you can apply these ideas to almost any imaging modality.\"}\n  ]\n}",
