Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere is a real-world example that makes these abstract concepts much more concrete.\nThis plot shows the diagnostic performance of 108 radiologists in the United States, taken from a study by Beam and colleagues. On the vertical axis, you see the true positive fraction — in other words, sensitivity. On the horizontal axis, you see the false positive fraction — that is, one minus specificity.\n\nEach point here represents a single radiologist’s performance. And what stands out immediately is how widely they are spread. Some radiologists operate near the upper-left corner, meaning they consistently detect disease with very few false alarms. Others are closer to the diagonal, where their decisions are only slightly better than random guessing.\n\nSo even though all of these doctors are trained professionals looking at the same kinds of images, their diagnostic accuracy varies enormously. That variation has practical consequences. Finding a skilled radiologist can make the difference between catching an early tumor and missing it altogether.\nIt’s very similar to what we see in education and research. A strong student working with the right mentor can achieve exceptional results, while another, equally intelligent student might struggle under weaker guidance. In both cases, performance isn’t just about the system — it’s also about the human observer.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<diagnostic performance>\", \"p\":\"measures\",\n     \"o\":\"<sensitivity>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"Each point here represents a single radiologist’s performance.
