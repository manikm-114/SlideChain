Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nWhen we construct a similarity measure, the goal is to capture not just how different two images are, but how similar they are. To do this properly, we want our measure to satisfy three basic conditions, or postulates.\n\nFirst, symmetry. The similarity between X and Y should be the same as the similarity between Y and X. In other words, order doesn’t matter. If you compare image A with image B, you should get the same result as comparing image B with image A.\nSecond, boundedness. The similarity value should always be between zero and one. A score of one means the images are perfectly identical. A score closer to zero means they are very different.\nThird, a unique maximum. The similarity should only reach the maximum value of one if the two images are exactly the same, pixel for pixel. That way, the measure has a clear and meaningful interpretation.\n\nThese three conditions — symmetry, boundedness, and unique maximum — make sure that a similarity measure behaves logically and reliably. SSIM is designed to satisfy all of these postulates.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"similarity measure\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"SSIM\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"SSIM is designed to satisfy all of these postulates.\"}\n  ]\n}",
