Today we begin Lecture Eleven, which is all about image quality assessment. This is really a landmark lecture in our course. After today, we’ll move on to imaging modalities themselves. By then, the green textbook you have will serve as your main reference, and I’ll continue using my slides to bring in a consistent story and sometimes involving state-of-the-art developments.\n\nSo why is quality assessment so important? Think about it this way: once an imaging system produces an image, the very first question we must ask is, is this image good enough? Is it clear, reliable, and suitable for diagnosis? That is what quality assessment is all about — it’s the final piece of the foundation we need before diving into the modalities.\n\nSo, with that background, let’s begin our journey into image quality assessment.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"image quality assessment\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"diagnosis\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"Once an imaging system produces an image, the very first question we must ask is, is this image good enough?
