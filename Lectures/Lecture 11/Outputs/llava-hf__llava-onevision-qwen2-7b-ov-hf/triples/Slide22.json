Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere’s a simple example of a changeover background.\n\nLook at the first column on the left. The top image has about 10 dots, while the bottom has about 20 dots. The difference is 10. When you compare them, it’s very obvious that the bottom one has more dots than the top one.\nNow look at the second column. The top image has about 110 dots, and the bottom has about 120 dots. Again, the difference is 10. But this time, it’s much harder to notice the difference.\n\nWhy? Because the background level — the total number of dots — is so much higher. A change of 10 is a large fraction when the background is only 10, but it’s a tiny fraction when the background is already 110.\nThis illustrates the principle we just discussed: what our visual system detects is not the absolute change, but the relative change — delta divided by the background.\n\nSo, when we design a similarity measure, we want it to reflect this property of human vision. And that’s exactly what the contrast comparison in SSIM does. It behaves in a way that is consistent with how we see.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"changeover background\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"difference in number of dots\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"The difference is 10.
