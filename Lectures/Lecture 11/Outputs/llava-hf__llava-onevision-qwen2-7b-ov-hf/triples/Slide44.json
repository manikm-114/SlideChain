Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, let’s take our overlapping case and place a conservative threshold, shown by the blue line here.\n\nWith this choice, notice what happens. For diseased patients, only those who fall far to the right of the threshold are called positive. That means many truly diseased patients on the left side are missed. The sensitivity — or true positive rate — drops to around 50%.\nOn the other hand, for healthy patients, almost all are correctly classified. Only a very small slice on the right is misclassified as diseased. That means the false positive fraction is low, and specificity is high.\n\nSo in ROC space, where we plot sensitivity against 1 minus specificity, this operating point appears toward the lower-left corner. It reflects a cautious decision-making style: you’re very reluctant to call a disease, so you minimize false alarms. But the trade-off is that you miss a lot of true cases.\nThis illustrates the key idea: where you set the threshold directly determines the balance between sensitivity and specificity.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"conservative threshold\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"diseased patients\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"For diseased patients, only those who fall far to the right of the threshold are called positive.
