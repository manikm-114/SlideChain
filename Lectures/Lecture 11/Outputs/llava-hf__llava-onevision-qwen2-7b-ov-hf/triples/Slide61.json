Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSupervised learning builds on this idea by training models directly on labeled data. For example, in the XOR problem, linear classifiers cannot draw a single straight line to separate the classes. But by introducing hidden layers and nonlinear activation functions, a neural network can learn to separate the classes correctly.\n\nThe figure shows how the inputs are transformed step by step through hidden units and weights, leading to correct outputs for all training examples. This principle extends far beyond toy problems—it is the basis of modern deep learning, where very large networks can learn hierarchical features from medical images and achieve state-of-the-art performance.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"supervised learning\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"training models\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"builds on this idea by training models directly on labeled data\"}\n  ],\n    {\"s\":\"XOR problem\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"linear classifiers\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"cannot draw a single straight line to separate the classes\"}\n  ],\n    {\"s\":\"neural network\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"hidden layers and nonlinear activation functions\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"can learn to separate the classes correctly\"}\n  ],\n    {\"s\":\"modern deep learning\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"large networks\",",
