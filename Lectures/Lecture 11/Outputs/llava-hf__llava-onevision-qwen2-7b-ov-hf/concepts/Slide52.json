From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow that we’ve seen how radiologists vary in their diagnostic performance, let’s ask an important question: can we systematically model this decision-making process?\n\nThis brings us to the concept of model observers. A model observer is essentially a mathematical framework or a computational algorithm that simulates the way a human might read an image and make a decision.\nThe idea is motivated by a practical challenge. Human reader studies are expensive, time-consuming, and often inconsistent — one doctor may interpret an image differently than another. If we want to optimize imaging systems or evaluate new reconstruction methods, relying on large-scale human studies is not always feasible.\n\nSo instead, we can build a numerical observer that “looks” at the images and performs the task — whether that’s detecting a small tumor, classifying an abnormality, or distinguishing between signal and noise.\nIn this review paper by Xin He and Subok Park from the FDA, the authors summarize the foundations of model observers in medical imaging research. They describe how these observers can be based on rigorous statistical decision theory, how they can be tailored to mimic human visual performance, and how they’re applied in practice — from system optimization to regulatory science.\n\nIn the next few slides, I’ll introduce you to some of the key types of model observers, starting from the ideal observer, and then moving toward more practical approximations like the Hotelling observer and modern approaches involving machine learning and neural networks.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
