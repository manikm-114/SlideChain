From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere we see a typical scene from a radiology department. A radiologist, with years of training and experience, carefully reviews CT scans and X-rays. Their task is not to admire image sharpness or pixel resolution — it is to answer very specific clinical questions:\n\nDoes this smoker have a lung tumor?\nAre the coronary arteries narrowed?\nIs there evidence of disease that requires treatment?\n\nThis highlights why task-specific measures are so important.\nSystem-specific measures — like spatial resolution, SNR, or temporal resolution — are useful, but they are not the end goal. They only tell us about the technical performance of the imaging system. What really matters is whether the system can support the clinical task: detecting, diagnosing, and guiding treatment decisions.\n\nSo in this part of the lecture, we’ll look at task-specific measures such as sensitivity, specificity, ROC curves, and observer studies, which are all designed to assess performance in clinical terms rather than engineering terms.\n\nThis shift in perspective is critical: we move from asking “How sharp is this image?” to asking “Can this image help us detect disease reliably?”\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"sensitivity\", \"category\": \"quality_metric\"},\n    {\"term\": \"specificity\", \"category\": \"quality_metric\"},\n    {\"term\": \"ROC curves\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"observer studies\", \"category\": \"quality_metric\"},\n    {\"term\": \"task-specific measures\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"clinical task\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"technical performance\", \"category\": \"physics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"technical performance\", \"category\": \"instrumentation\"},\n    {\"term\": \"technical performance\", \"category\": \"data_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"technical performance\", \"category\": \"reconstruction\"},\n    {\"term\": \"technical performance\", \"category\": \"communication\"},\n    {\"term\": \"technical performance\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"technical performance\", \"category\": \"anatomy\"},\n    {\"term\": \"technical performance\", \"category\": \"algorithm\"},\n    {\"term\": \"technical performance\", \"category\": \"ai_ml\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"This highlights why task-specific measures are so important.\", \"They only tell us about",
