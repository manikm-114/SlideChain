From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere we see a fuzzier, more realistic version of the XOR problem. Instead of perfectly separable points, the data is noisy and overlaps. This is much closer to what we encounter in medical imaging, where disease and non-disease cases are not cleanly separated but instead distributed with overlaps.\n\nThe nonlinear classifier can still learn a curved boundary that separates the classes reasonably well. This illustrates why nonlinear observers and machine learning are crucial: they can adapt to complex, messy data, rather than relying on oversimplified linear rules.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"XOR problem\", \"category\": \"ai_ml\"},\n    {\"term\": \"nonlinear classifier\", \"category\": \"ai_ml\"},\n    {\"term\": \"medical imaging\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"disease and non-disease cases\", \"category\": \"anatomy\"},\n    {\"term\": \"noisy and overlaps\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"curved boundary\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"complex, messy data\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"nonlinear observers\", \"category\": \"ai_ml\"},\n    {\"term\": \"machine learning\", \"category\": \"ai_ml\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"This is much closer to what we encounter in medical imaging, where disease and non-disease cases are not cleanly separated but instead distributed with overlaps.\", \"The nonlinear classifier can still learn a curved boundary that separates the classes reasonably well.\"]\n}\n```",
