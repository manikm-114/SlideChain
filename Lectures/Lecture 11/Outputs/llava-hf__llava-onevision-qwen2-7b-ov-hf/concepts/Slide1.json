From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nWelcome, everyone. Today we begin Lecture Eleven, which is all about image quality assessment. This is really a landmark lecture in our course. After today, we’ll move on to imaging modalities themselves. By then, the green textbook you have will serve as your main reference, and I’ll continue using my slides to bring in a consistent story and sometimes involving state-of-the-art developments.\n\nSo why is quality assessment so important? Think about it this way: once an imaging system produces an image, the very first question we must ask is, is this image good enough? Is it clear, reliable, and suitable for diagnosis? That is what quality assessment is all about — it’s the final piece of the foundation we need before diving into the modalities.\n\nSo, with that background, let’s begin our journey into image quality assessment.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"image quality assessment\", \"category\": \"quality_metric\"},\n    {\"term\": \"diagnosis\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"image\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"reliability\", \"category\": \"quality_metric\"},\n    {\"term\": \"clarity\", \"category\": \"quality_metric\"},\n    {\"term\": \"suitability\", \"category\": \"quality_metric\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"Once an imaging system produces an image, the very first question we must ask is, is this image good enough?
