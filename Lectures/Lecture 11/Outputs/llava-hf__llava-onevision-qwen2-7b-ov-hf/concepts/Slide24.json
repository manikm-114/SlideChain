From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s connect this to a very important mathematical principle: the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality.\n\nYou may remember this from linear algebra. It tells us that the inner product of two vectors is always less than or equal to the product of their lengths. Equality holds only when the two vectors are linearly related — in other words, when one is just a scaled version of the other.\n\nWhy is this important here? Well, recall that in structural comparison, we represent each image as a vector in a high-dimensional space. The structural similarity is essentially the normalized inner product between those two vectors.\nThe Cauchy–Schwarz inequality guarantees that this similarity value will always lie between zero and one, and it will reach one only when the two images are structurally identical, differing at most by a scaling factor.\n\nSo, this inequality is the mathematical reason why the structural comparison term works. It’s not just a rule chosen arbitrarily — it’s grounded in solid geometry.\nAnd as engineers and scientists, it’s always valuable to know not just how something works, but why. Understanding the principle behind the rule allows you to be creative and adapt these ideas in new situations.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
