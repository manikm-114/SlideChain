From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s look at a moderate threshold setting.\n\nThis time, we shift the decision boundary slightly to the left. What happens? More of the diseased distribution now falls to the right of the threshold. That means a greater fraction of patients with the disease are correctly identified. In other words, the sensitivity increases.\nBut the trade-off is clear. By moving the line left, we also capture more of the non-diseased distribution in the red region. That means more healthy patients are incorrectly flagged as diseased. The false positive fraction increases.\n\nOn the ROC curve, you can see this move as a step upward — higher sensitivity — but also a step to the right — higher false positive fraction. In other words, we’ve shifted from the black cross to the yellow cross on this plot.\n\nThis “moderate” threshold represents a more balanced decision-making strategy: better at catching true cases, but at the cost of more false alarms.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"threshold\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"diseased distribution\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"sensitivity\", \"category\": \"quality_metric\"},\n    {\"term\": \"false positive fraction\", \"category\": \"quality_metric\"},\n    {\"term\": \"ROC curve\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"trade-off\", \"category\": \"workflow\"},\n    {\"term\": \"moderate\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"decision-making strategy\", \"category\": \"workflow\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"This time, we shift the decision boundary slightly to the left.
