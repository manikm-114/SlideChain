Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nUp to this point, we have mostly talked about linear observers, such as the Hotelling observer and its channelized version. But in reality, many problems in medical imaging are nonlinear.\n\nTake the XOR problem as a classic example. If you try to separate the inputs using a simple straight line, you quickly find it cannot be done. Linear observers fail in such situations because the data are not linearly separable.\n\nTo overcome this, we use nonlinear observers, often built using neural networks. Here, you see a simple network with two input variables, two hidden units, and one output. By combining the information in a nonlinear way, the network can correctly separate the classes.\nThis idea is powerful for medical imaging tasks. Images are complex — disease and non-disease patterns may overlap, and linear models are not enough to make accurate decisions. Neural networks, however, can learn complicated nonlinear boundaries, allowing them to detect subtle patterns and interactions that traditional methods miss.\n\nSo nonlinear observers represent the next step: moving from simple linear discrimination toward flexible, data-driven models that can capture the true complexity of biological signals.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
