From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNext, let’s talk about spatial resolution, which is one of the most important measures of image quality.\n\nThe simplest way to think about spatial resolution is in terms of how well an imaging system can distinguish two objects that are close together. For example, imagine two very small, bright points — like two tiny tumors. Mathematically, we describe each of those points as a delta function, which represents a perfect single dot.\n\nBut in reality, no imaging system can reproduce a perfect dot. Instead, each point becomes blurred into a small disk, usually shaped like a Gaussian curve. This blur is called the point spread function, or PSF. It tells us how the system responds to a single point source.\nNow, suppose we have two points. If they are far apart, even though each one is blurry, you can still clearly see two separate spots. But as they move closer together, the two blurred shapes begin to overlap. Eventually, when the separation between them is too small, the two spots merge and appear as one.\n\nThe critical threshold is defined by the full width at half maximum, or FWHM, of the point spread function. In other words, when the distance between the two points is equal to the width of the blur at half its height, that’s about the limit of what the imaging system can resolve. Any closer, and the system can no longer distinguish the two points.\n\nThis is why we say spatial resolution is the minimum separation at which two objects can still be seen as distinct. Often, when people talk about “resolution” in imaging, this is what they mean: the ability to resolve fine detail.\nAnother way to analyze resolution — which we’ll get to shortly — is through the modulation transfer function, or MTF, which uses Fourier analysis to quantify how well different spatial frequencies are preserved in the image.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
