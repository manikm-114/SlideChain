From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nFinally, here is your homework. You will use the MATLAB code available online to compute the Structural Similarity Index, or SSIM, between two images. SSIM is a perceptual metric that compares luminance, contrast, and structure.\n\nYour task is two-fold. First, compute SSIM for a pair of images—either the ones shown here or another pair of your choice. Second, design an example where sensitivity is 90% and specificity is 80%, and show your calculations.\n\nThis exercise is meant to reinforce your understanding of both image quality metrics and diagnostic performance measures. The due date is one week later, so please manage your time accordingly.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Reject filler or administrative text.\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\n      \"term\": \"structural similarity index\",\n      \"category\": \"quality_metric\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"ssim\",\n      \"category\": \"quality_metric\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"luminance\",\n      \"category\": \"signal_processing\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"contrast\",\n      \"category\": \"signal_processing\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"structure\",\n      \"category\": \"signal_processing\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"sensitivity\",\n      \"category\": \"mathematics\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"specificity\",\n      \"category\": \"mathematics\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"matlab code\",\n      \"category\": \"software\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"perceptual metric\",\n      \"category\": \"quality_metric\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\n    \"compute the Structural Similarity Index, or SSIM, between two images\",\n    \"SSIM is a perceptual metric that compares luminance, contrast, and structure\",\n    \"Compute sensitivity and specificity\",\n    \"Make an example so that sensitivity and specificity are 90% and",
