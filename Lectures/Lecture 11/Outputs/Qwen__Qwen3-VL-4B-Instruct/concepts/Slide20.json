From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThe second component of SSIM is the contrast comparison.\nEven if two images have the same average brightness, they may still look very different if their contrast is not the same. One might look sharp and vivid, while the other looks flat or washed out. To capture this, we use the standard deviation of pixel values — sigma-X for image X and sigma-Y for image Y.\n\nThe formula for contrast comparison looks very similar to the one we used for luminance. It is written as:\nC of X and Y equals two times sigma-X times sigma-Y, plus a constant C2, divided by sigma-X squared plus sigma-Y squared, plus that same constant C2.\n\nHere again, the constant is added to prevent instability when values are close to zero. C2 is defined as K2 times L squared, where L is the dynamic range of the image.\nNow, notice how this works:\nIf the two images have the same standard deviation, meaning their contrasts are the same, then the numerator and denominator match, and the contrast comparison equals 1.\nIf one image has much higher or lower contrast than the other, then the ratio becomes smaller, and the similarity drops.\nThis design is also consistent with how the human visual system works. For example, in a very dark room, small changes in brightness can be quite noticeable. But in a very bright, high-contrast scene, the same small changes are much harder to see. The formula reflects this effect, sometimes called contrast masking.\n\nSo contrast is the second pillar of structural similarity — it ensures that two images not only have the same average brightness but also the same level of variation around that average.\nNext, we’ll look at the third pillar: the structural comparison.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
