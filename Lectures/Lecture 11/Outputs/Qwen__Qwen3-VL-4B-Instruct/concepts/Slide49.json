From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s quantify what we’ve been discussing. The receiver operating characteristic, or ROC curve, gives us a full picture of diagnostic performance across different decision thresholds. But how do we summarize the curve with a single number?\nThat’s where the area under the ROC curve, or AUC, comes in.\n\nIf the curve falls along the diagonal, the area is 0.5. That means the test has no predictive value — you’re essentially flipping a coin. A perfect test, one that never misses disease and never gives false alarms, would trace along the top and left borders, with an AUC equal to 1. In practice, no system achieves that ideal, because there’s always some chance of error.\nSo most real diagnostic tests fall somewhere in between. The higher the area under the curve, the better the test is at distinguishing diseased from non-diseased cases.\n\nThis is why AUC has become such a standard benchmark. It condenses all those trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity into a single number. And just like in teaching or training, performance varies — some students, or some doctors, do exceptionally well; others struggle. The ROC and its AUC make that difference visible in a very clear, quantitative way.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
