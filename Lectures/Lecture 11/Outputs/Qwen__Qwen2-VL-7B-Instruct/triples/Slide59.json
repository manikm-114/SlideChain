Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s move into the topic of radiomics, which is an exciting area in modern medical imaging.\nRadiomics is all about turning images into data. Instead of relying only on what a radiologist can see with the naked eye, we extract hundreds or even thousands of quantitative features from medical images.\n\nFor example, once we outline a tumor on an image, we can study different categories of features:\nShape features tell us about the geometry — is the tumor round, irregular, or elongated?\nIntensity features describe how bright or dark the pixels are, and how their distribution looks in a histogram.\nTexture features capture the patterns inside the tumor, such as whether it looks smooth, coarse, or heterogeneous. These can be computed using statistical methods like gray-level co-occurrence matrices or run-length matrices.\n\nAfter we collect these features, we don’t stop there. The next step is to feed them into a prediction model. This model may perform tasks like selecting the most important features, classifying patients into groups, or predicting outcomes such as how well a patient will respond to treatment.\n\nSo radiomics really bridges imaging with data science. It takes us beyond the visual impression and allows us to mine the hidden information in images, often leading to insights that are not visible to the human eye.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
