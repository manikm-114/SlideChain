Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s look at a moderate threshold setting.\n\nThis time, we shift the decision boundary slightly to the left. What happens? More of the diseased distribution now falls to the right of the threshold. That means a greater fraction of patients with the disease are correctly identified. In other words, the sensitivity increases.\nBut the trade-off is clear. By moving the line left, we also capture more of the non-diseased distribution in the red region. That means more healthy patients are incorrectly flagged as diseased. The false positive fraction increases.\n\nOn the ROC curve, you can see this move as a step upward — higher sensitivity — but also a step to the right — higher false positive fraction. In other words, we’ve shifted from the black cross to the yellow cross on this plot.\n\nThis “moderate” threshold represents a more balanced decision-making strategy: better at catching true cases, but at the cost of more false alarms.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}",
