Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo far, we’ve covered general measures like MSE, KL distance, and SSIM, and then system-specific measures such as noise, resolution, and artifacts.\n\nNow we move to the third and most important part: task-specific measures.\nWhen manufacturers design an imaging system, they often advertise its specifications — resolution, noise levels, dose reduction, acquisition speed, and so on. These system specs are useful, but in practice, they don’t directly answer the most important question: Can the system help us make the right clinical decision?\n\nThink about it. As patients or physicians, we don’t actually care whether an image has 0.5-millimeter resolution or 1-millimeter resolution, or whether the noise level is 2 percent or 5 percent. What we really care about is whether the image allows us to detect a tumor, diagnose a fracture, or rule out disease with confidence.\n\nThat’s why task-based assessment is so important. It focuses on the end goal: whether the imaging system can successfully support the clinical task.\n\nSo in this last part of the lecture, we’ll discuss task-specific measures such as sensitivity and specificity, ROC and AUC analysis, human and mathematical observers, and even modern approaches like neural networks and radiomics.\n\nThese measures shift our attention from the imaging device itself to the diagnostic performance of the entire workflow, which is ultimately what matters most in medical imaging.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
