From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAnd now, we can finally put everything together.\n\nWe’ve defined three components: luminance comparison, contrast comparison, and structural comparison. Each one captures a different aspect of how two images may look alike or differ. The Structural Similarity Index, or SSIM, is built by combining all three.\nMathematically, the SSIM of X and Y is written as:\nluminance term raised to the power alpha, multiplied by the contrast term raised to the power beta, multiplied by the structure term raised to the power gamma.\n\nThe parameters alpha, beta, and gamma simply allow us to adjust the relative importance of the three components. In practice, we usually set all three equal to one, giving equal weight to luminance, contrast, and structure.\nTo keep the formula stable, we also include constants — C1, C2, and C3. These prevent divisions by very small numbers, which could make the result unstable. For convenience, researchers often set C3 equal to half of C2. These are empirical design choices, not strict theory, but they work well in practice.\nWith these simplifications, we arrive at the familiar form of SSIM that is widely used today. This measure is often referred to as the Universal Quality Index with stabilizing constants added.\n\nThe remarkable thing is how well SSIM works. Despite its simplicity, it has become one of the most widely used metrics for image quality, both in research and in industry. Even today, when we use deep learning and advanced algorithms for image processing, SSIM and mean squared error remain the standard reference metrics.\n\nSo, this is the moment where SSIM is born — a simple but powerful measure that aligns closely with human perception and has stood the test of time.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
