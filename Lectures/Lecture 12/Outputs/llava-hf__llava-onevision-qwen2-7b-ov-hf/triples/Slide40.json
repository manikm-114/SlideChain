Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo how do we actually perform a dual-energy measurement?\nThe key is that we collect data using two different X-ray spectra. Let’s call them spectrum one and spectrum two.\n\nNow, recall that the attenuation coefficient has two main components — the photoelectric part and the Compton scattering part. When we take the line integral along an X-ray path, we can separate these contributions into two quantities. We usually call them A1 and A2.\nSo what happens is this: if we measure the transmitted X-ray signal with spectrum one, we get one equation that depends on A1 and A2. If we measure again with spectrum two, we get a second equation.\n\nNow we have two equations and two unknowns. That means we can solve for A1 and A2. And once we know A1 and A2, we can reconstruct the attenuation coefficient at any X-ray energy.\nThat’s the whole idea of dual-energy CT. By using two spectra, we get enough independent information to separate the photoelectric and Compton contributions. And from there, we can start to do material decomposition — distinguishing water from bone, or even identifying contrast agents like iodine or gold.\n\nSo dual-energy imaging is not just a trick with hardware. It has a very solid physical and mathematical foundation.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
