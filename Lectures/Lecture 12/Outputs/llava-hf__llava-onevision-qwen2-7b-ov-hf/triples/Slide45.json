Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere we see the landmark result.\n\nThese are the very first human CT images acquired with a photon-counting detector. In the top row, you can compare conventional energy-integrating CT with photon-counting CT. At this stage, the overall image quality and diagnostic value are already comparable to the best systems currently in use.\nBut what’s truly remarkable lies in the bottom row. With photon-counting CT, we can separate energy information and create maps — for example, iodine concentration maps — directly from the same scan. This means we are no longer limited to grayscale attenuation images. Instead, we can extract quantitative spectral information, detect contrast agents with high specificity, and even generate functional or molecular-level insights.\n\nSo this is not just an incremental improvement. This represents a paradigm shift. We are moving from conventional black-and-white CT into a new era of spectral and molecular CT imaging, powered by photon-counting technology.\nThe field is advancing rapidly, and these first results are just the beginning. With further improvements, photon-counting CT promises to fundamentally transform the way we diagnose and study human disease.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
