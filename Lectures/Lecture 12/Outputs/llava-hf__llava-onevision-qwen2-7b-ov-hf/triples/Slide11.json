Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nYou may remember this TED-Ed video, “How X-rays See Through Your Skin,” which I showed you earlier. When I first shared it, it already had a large number of views, and since then, the count has only grown. That tells you how many people around the world are curious about the history and the science of X-rays.\n\nIt’s a short, engaging explanation of how X-rays work, and I encourage you to watch it again after today’s lecture. With the background you now have, you may notice details you didn’t fully appreciate before. Revisiting resources like this, once you have more context, is a great way to deepen your understanding.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"X-rays\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"TED-Ed video\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"When I first shared it, it already had a large number of views, and since then, the count has only grown.
