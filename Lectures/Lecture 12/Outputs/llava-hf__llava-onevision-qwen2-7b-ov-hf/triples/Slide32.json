Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s look at how contrast agents take advantage of the K-edge effect we just discussed.\nOn this plot, we see the mass attenuation curves for different substances: lipid, water, bone, iodine, gadolinium, and gold. Notice that lipid, water, and bone have smooth curves that gradually decrease as energy increases. Without extra information, their signals can overlap, and it’s very difficult to tell them apart.\n\nBut look closely at iodine, gadolinium, and gold. Each has a sharp jump in attenuation at its characteristic K-edge energy. Iodine has its edge at about 33 keV, gadolinium around 50 keV, and gold at about 80 keV. These discontinuities are like chemical “fingerprints.”\nIf your detector simply integrates all energies, you cannot distinguish whether the bright signal you see comes from iodine, or from gold, or even a mixture of bone and water. But if you can measure the attenuation as a function of energy — in other words, if you can see the shape of this curve — then you can identify which element is responsible.\n\nThis is the basis of K-edge imaging. By designing energy-sensitive detectors, we can separate the signals of different contrast agents. Clinically, iodine is already the most common CT contrast agent. Gadolinium, which is widely used in MRI, can also be detected in spectral CT. And gold nanoparticles are being investigated for advanced applications, including molecular imaging and drug delivery, because of their strong K-edge at higher energies.\n\nSo the key message here is: traditional CT shows only grayscale intensity, but spectral CT can unlock these curves and make imaging chemically specific. That allows us not only to see anatomy, but also to distinguish materials and track contrast agents at the molecular level.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
