Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s move to the last topic in this section: photon-counting CT.\n\nUp to this point, we’ve mostly been talking about conventional detectors. Those are what we call current-integrating detectors. What they really do is add up all the incoming X-ray photons across the entire energy spectrum, and then report one number. In other words, they just give us the area under the curve. That means we only get a grayscale image — essentially black and white — where each pixel represents total intensity.\n\nBut imagine if, instead of throwing all the energy information into one basket, we could measure the energy of each photon. That’s the principle of photon-counting detectors. Instead of giving you one number, they break the spectrum into many energy bins.\nSo now, instead of saying “this voxel attenuates X-rays by this much in total,” we can say, “here is how it attenuates soft X-rays, medium-energy X-rays, and high-energy X-rays.” That gives us a rich spectrum of information.\nAnd here’s the exciting part: with that energy-resolved data, we can make not just one grayscale image, but multiple images across energy ranges. \n\nWe can even assign colors to those ranges. The result is what we sometimes call spectral CT or molecular CT imaging, where each material can be distinguished by its unique spectral fingerprint.\nSo while conventional CT gives us one picture in shades of gray, photon-counting CT has the potential to give us multiple pictures at once, even in color. That’s the future direction of CT technology.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1].
