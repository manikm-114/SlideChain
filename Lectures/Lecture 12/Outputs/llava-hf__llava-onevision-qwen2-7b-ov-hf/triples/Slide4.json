Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThe story of X-ray discovery is actually a wonderful example of serendipity in science. In 1895, Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen was experimenting with a cathode ray tube — essentially an early electron gun — when he noticed something unexpected. A nearby fluorescent screen began to glow, even though the tube was enclosed in a box. By accident, he had discovered a new kind of invisible ray that could pass through many opaque materials. He called it the “X-ray,” where the letter X simply meant “unknown.”\n\nOne of the first images he captured was of his wife’s hand, showing her bones and even her wedding ring. That single picture immediately revealed the enormous potential of this discovery for medicine.\nRöntgen’s work was recognized worldwide, and in 1901, he was awarded the very first Nobel Prize in Physics.\nSo from a chance observation in the laboratory came one of the most important tools in medical diagnosis — the X-ray.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
