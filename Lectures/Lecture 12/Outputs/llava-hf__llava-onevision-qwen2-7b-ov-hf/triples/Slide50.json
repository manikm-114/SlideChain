Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAlright, before we wrap up today’s lecture, let me leave you with the homework assignment.\nFrom now on, we’ll be following the green textbook as our main reference. Each week I’ll select a few problems that are especially useful for reinforcing the key concepts we’ve covered.\n\nFor this week, please work on the following three problems:\nPage 50, Problem 1.1\nPage 51, Problem 1.3\nPage 51, Problem 1.6\nThese are not particularly difficult, but they will give you a chance to apply what we’ve discussed in class and make sure the ideas really sink in.\n\nSo much for today’s lecture — thank you, and I’ll see you in the next class.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<Page 50, Problem 1.1>\", \"p\":\"uses\",\n     \"o\":\"<green textbook>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"Each week I’ll select a few problems that are especially useful for reinforcing the key concepts we’ve covered.\"}\n  ]\n}",
