  "raw_output": "user \nSystem:\nYou are extracting factual relations from a medical imaging lecture. Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere we have X-ray computed tomography, or CT. Unlike a simple radiograph, CT allows us to see a clear cross-sectional view of the body. With CT, the resolution can be extremely fine, down to about 300 microns, which is three-tenths of a millimeter. That means we can visualize very small structures and details inside the body.\n\nHow do we actually make a cross-sectional image from X-rays? That is the central question of CT, and it will be the focus of our next lecture. For now, I just want to give you a sense of how powerful this technology is.\nWhen you see images like this, you realize how useful X-ray imaging can be. Hopefully, this motivates you to dig deeper — to understand how the X-ray source, the detectors, and the reconstruction process all work together to extract as much information as possible from the human body.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"X-ray computed tomography (CT)\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"Cross-sectional view of the body\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"Unlike a simple radiograph, CT allows us to see a clear cross-sectional view of the body.\"}\n  ]\n}",
