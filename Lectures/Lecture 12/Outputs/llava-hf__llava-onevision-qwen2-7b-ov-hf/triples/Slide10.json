Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLooking into the future, X-ray imaging may become far more portable and accessible. Imagine carrying a powerful but compact X-ray device — perhaps even something integrated into a smartphone. It may sound futuristic, but nothing is stopping us from thinking outside the box.\n\nOne open question is how to make X-ray imaging as cheap and convenient as possible. Believe it or not, there are papers suggesting that even something as simple as peeling Scotch tape can generate X-rays under certain conditions. If you’re curious, you can look up this fascinating idea.\nSo while today we use large, expensive machines, the future may bring surprising and creative ways to generate and use X-rays. New ideas like these could turn out to be very important for both medicine and technology.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"portable X-ray device\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"compact X-ray device\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"Imagine carrying a powerful but compact X-ray device — perhaps even something integrated into a smartphone.\"}\n  ]\n}",
