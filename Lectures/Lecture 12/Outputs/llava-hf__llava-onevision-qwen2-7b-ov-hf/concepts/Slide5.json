From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nRöntgen made his discovery while experimenting with a cathode tube. At that time, he didn’t know what was happening — nobody did. He placed the tube inside a box, and unexpectedly, a nearby fluorescent screen lit up. When he looked closer, he noticed that objects could block or shape this invisible radiation. For example, a metallic cross placed in front of the tube cast a clear shadow on the screen. This was something completely new — it couldn’t be explained without assuming that some kind of invisible physical rays were being produced.\n\nBecause the nature of these rays was unknown, he called them “X-rays.” Later, they became known as Röntgen rays, in honor of his discovery.\nThis breakthrough was so important that Röntgen was awarded the very first Nobel Prize in Physics. Today, of course, we understand X-rays in much greater detail, but the original observation was truly remarkable for its time.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
