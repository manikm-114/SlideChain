From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere we have X-ray computed tomography, or CT. Unlike a simple radiograph, CT allows us to see a clear cross-sectional view of the body. With CT, the resolution can be extremely fine, down to about 300 microns, which is three-tenths of a millimeter. That means we can visualize very small structures and details inside the body.\n\nHow do we actually make a cross-sectional image from X-rays? That is the central question of CT, and it will be the focus of our next lecture. For now, I just want to give you a sense of how powerful this technology is.\nWhen you see images like this, you realize how useful X-ray imaging can be. Hopefully, this motivates you to dig deeper — to understand how the X-ray source, the detectors, and the reconstruction process all work together to extract as much information as possible from the human body.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"cross-sectional imaging\", \"category\": \"reconstruction\"},\n    {\"term\": \"X-ray computed tomography\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"CT\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"resolution\", \"category\": \"quality_metric\"},\n    {\"term\": \"300 microns\", \"category\": \"quality_metric\"},\n    {\"term\": \"X-ray source\", \"category\": \"instrumentation\"},\n    {\"term\": \"detectors\", \"category\": \"instrumentation\"},\n    {\"term\": \"reconstruction process\", \"category\": \"reconstruction\"},\n    {\"term\": \"human body\", \"category\": \"anatomy\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"Here we have X-ray computed tomography, or CT.
