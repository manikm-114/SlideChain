From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nCompton scattering has major implications for radiation protection.\n\nWhen we use X-rays on a patient, most of the useful photons travel through the body and reach the detector to form the image. But many photons do not follow this direct path — instead, they are scattered in different directions. These scattered photons, especially those from Compton scattering, can expose people nearby.\n\nThat is why radiation protection is so critical. For patients, the exposure is usually occasional — maybe once a year, or only when necessary. But for radiologists and technicians working in X-ray rooms every day, the exposure could accumulate over time if they are not protected.\nTo minimize this risk, we use lead shielding, such as lead glass windows and lead aprons. These barriers absorb scattered radiation and protect staff from unnecessary dose. Without them, repeated daily exposure could become dangerous.\n\nSo, one of the key lessons is that while X-rays are extremely valuable for diagnosis, we must always use proper shielding and safety measures to protect healthcare workers.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
