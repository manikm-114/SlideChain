From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nBy now, you understand how X-rays are generated. That knowledge positions you well, not only for deeper research in this field but also for practical discussions, even in job interviews.\n\nNow we move to the next important part of the imaging chain — X-ray attenuation. Once X-rays are produced by the tube, or in some cases by a synchrotron radiation source, we use them to probe an object or a patient. As the X-rays travel through matter, some of them are absorbed, some are scattered, and some pass through with little interaction.\n\nIt’s in this process — the way X-rays are attenuated by different tissues or materials — that valuable diagnostic information is encoded. Understanding attenuation is crucial because it directly determines the contrast and quality of the images we can produce.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Reject filler or administrative text.\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\n      \"term\": \"X-ray attenuation\",\n      \"category\": \"physics\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"scatter\",\n      \"category\": \"physics\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"absorption\",\n      \"category\": \"physics\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"X-rays are generated\",\n      \"category\": \"physics\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"probe an object or a patient\",\n      \"category\": \"physics\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"pass through with little interaction\",\n      \"category\": \"physics\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"valuable diagnostic information is encoded\",\n      \"category\": \"physics\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"contrast and quality of the images\",\n      \"category\": \"physics\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\n    \"Once X-rays are produced by the tube, or in some cases by a synchrotron radiation source, we use them to probe an object or a patient.\",\n    \"As the X-rays travel through matter, some of them are absorbed, some are scattered, and some pass through with little interaction.\",\n    \"It’s in this process — the",
