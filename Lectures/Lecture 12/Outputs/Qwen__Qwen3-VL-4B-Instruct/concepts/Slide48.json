From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere I want to highlight the work of one of my former PhD students, James Bennett.\n\nJames focused on the problem of cost and practicality. As you know, photon-counting detectors are still very expensive. If we want to move this technology from the lab to widespread clinical use, we need solutions that balance performance with cost-effectiveness.\nHis dissertation, later published in IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, presented a clever system design for hybrid spectral micro-CT. He demonstrated how combining energy-integrating detectors with photon-counting detectors can achieve many of the benefits of full spectral imaging — but at a fraction of the cost.\n\nThe results were promising: improved contrast resolution, better spatial resolution, and lower radiation dose. This work was an important step toward making spectral CT more practical and accessible for real biomedical applications.\n\nSo this is a good example of how doctoral research can contribute to both advancing the science and solving real-world challenges in medical imaging.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
