From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAs X-rays pass through biological tissue, they are progressively attenuated. This is a cumulative process: the number of photons decreases rapidly as the beam penetrates deeper.\n\nYou can think of the tissue as being made up of thin layers. Each layer absorbs a certain fraction of the incoming photons. A useful way to describe this is the half-value layer concept. Suppose you start with 1,000 X-ray photons. After passing through the first half-value layer, about half remain — 500 photons. After a second half-value layer of the same thickness, the number drops to about 250. After a few layers, only a small fraction of the original photons survive.\n\nSo attenuation is really a matter of probability: each layer has the same chance of absorbing a photon, and the result is an exponential reduction in the beam.\nIt’s also worth noting that X-ray imaging is not very efficient overall. In the tube, only about one percent of the electron energy is converted into usable X-ray photons — the rest is lost as heat. Then, after filtration and attenuation inside the patient, only a small percentage of the original photons actually reach the detector.\nThat’s why we need two things: smart algorithms to make the most of the limited data, and highly sensitive detectors to record even the relatively small number of photons that emerge.\n\nSo now you have the physical intuition. Next, we will introduce the mathematical description of attenuation — Beer’s Law — which provides a precise model for this exponential process.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
