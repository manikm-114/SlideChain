From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere is another example of our research direction. This work, also involving James and several collaborators, focused on image reconstruction for hybrid true-color micro-CT.\n\nThe goal was to demonstrate that when you combine hybrid detectors with proper reconstruction algorithms, you can actually generate color CT images. Instead of the usual grayscale representation, here you see different contrast agents represented in distinct colors.\nThe figure on the left shows a phantom study — different inserts with iodine, gold, and other materials, clearly separated into unique color channels. On the right, you can see reconstructions from biological samples, where regions of interest are highlighted, again providing more specific information than traditional CT.\n\nSo this is really a proof of concept: with hybrid spectral CT, we can move beyond just structure and begin to recover molecular or functional information. This was an important step toward what we now call “true-color CT.”\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
