Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere you can clearly see the difference between using an anti-scatter grid and not using one.\n\nOn the left, with the grid, the anatomical structures are much sharper. The boundaries of the ribs, the lung fields, and even the soft tissues are more clearly defined.\nOn the right, without the grid, the image looks more foggy. That haziness comes from scattered photons that are superimposed on top of the fine structures. Essentially, the scatter washes out important details and reduces contrast.\n\nThink of it like looking out of an airplane. On a clear day, you can see the ground with sharp detail. But on a cloudy day, the clouds blur your view. In the same way, scattered X-ray photons act like a layer of clouds, blurring the image and hiding subtle differences.\nThis becomes especially important when detecting low-contrast tumors. Without a grid, these tumors might be completely hidden in the fog of scatter. With a grid, however, you remove much of that scatter, revealing the underlying details more accurately.\n\nSo, using an anti-scatter grid can make the difference between detecting a disease early and missing it entirely.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
