Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nMedical X-rays are essential. Techniques such as plain radiographs and CT scans are the backbone of modern radiology. In fact, some of my colleagues and mentors often say: if you had to pick just one imaging modality as the cornerstone of modern medicine, it would be X-rays. If you take away X-ray imaging, hospitals simply cannot function effectively. If you take away any other modality, they can still manage, as long as X-rays remain available.\n\nThere are many reasons for this. X-ray imaging is relatively cheap and widely available. It provides high resolution and fast speed, which are crucial in clinical practice. Another advantage, and one I want to emphasize, is its high geometric accuracy.\n\nWhat does that mean? Think about MRI: it produces beautiful images, but sometimes those images are geometrically distorted. A tumor might appear shifted, much like how a pencil looks bent when you place it in a glass of water. If a surgeon were to rely on that distorted MRI image without correction, they might target the wrong spot. CT and X-ray imaging, by contrast, give you precise geometric accuracy. This accuracy allows us to deliver radiation beams for therapy or guide surgical procedures with confidence.\n\nX-ray imaging is also both sensitive and specific. Sensitivity means that if the disease is present, the imaging will detect it. Specificity means that if the disease is not present, the imaging will not falsely indicate it. So in many cases, X-rays provide a very reliable diagnostic tool. And even when they cannot fully answer the question, they guide us toward which additional imaging modality to use next.\n\nOf course, there are downsides. The most important is that X-rays are a form of ionizing radiation, which means there is some risk. But if the radiation dose is controlled, the risk is manageable. To put it in perspective, a typical CT scan delivers a dose roughly comparable to what you would receive on an international flight, for example, from the United States to China. If you are comfortable taking that trip, then you should not worry too much about a single CT scan. Still, we always work hard to minimize the dose, and over the past decade, remarkable progress has been made in reducing it — while maintaining high diagnostic quality.\n\nAnother limitation is that X-rays have poor contrast for soft tissue. Structures like the brain, liver, or tumors are not as clearly distinguished as they are with MRI. In many cases, we need to inject contrast agents to improve visibility.\nFinally, from a global perspective, the medical X-ray market is huge and continues to grow — billions of dollars worldwide, with steady expansion each year. This reflects not only how important X-rays are today, but also how much innovation continues in this field.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
