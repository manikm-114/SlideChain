Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nMedical X-ray imaging generally comes in two main forms.\n\nOn the left, you see the simpler and more cost-effective version: a single projection image, like a chest X-ray. It captures one view at a time, and everything inside the body is superimposed together in that picture.\nOn the right, the principle is extended. At any single instant, you still record just one projection. But instead of stopping there, the X-ray source and detector rotate around the patient. At the same time, the patient table can also move forward or backward. By acquiring projections from many different angles, we collect enough information to reconstruct detailed cross-sectional slices. When these slices are stacked together, they form a volumetric image of the entire body.\n\nSo, while projection radiography gives us a fast overview, computed tomography transforms those multiple views into a three-dimensional representation — a much richer source of information.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
