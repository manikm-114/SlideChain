Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nEnergy-integrating detectors are the most common, practical, and mature technology used in modern CT scanners. \n\nTheir principle is very simple: they collect the total energy deposited by all X-ray photons that arrive at the detector element. It doesn’t matter whether the incoming photons are high-energy or low-energy — in the end, they are all added together.\n\nNow, this technology works in two modes:\nIndirect mode\u000bIn indirect mode, the X-ray photons first pass through a layer of material called a phosphor, such as cesium iodide. The phosphor absorbs the X-ray energy and converts it into visible light. Each X-ray photon produces many visible light photons. These visible photons then strike a photodiode layer, which converts the light into an electrical current. The current is then read out by the circuit. In this process, higher-energy X-ray photons produce more visible light, but once converted to charge, all signals are summed together. That’s why this method is called energy integrating or sometimes current integrating.\n\nDirect mode\u000bIn direct mode, there is no intermediate light conversion. Instead, the X-rays interact directly with a semiconductor material, such as amorphous selenium. The X-ray photons generate electron-hole pairs in the material. Under a high-voltage bias, these charges are separated and collected as an electrical current. Again, the detector integrates all charges into one signal, which represents the total X-ray energy deposited.\nSo in both indirect and direct modes, the detector does not distinguish between high- and low-energy photons. It simply reports a single number, proportional to the total energy of all photons that passed through the patient. This gives us the grayscale images we are familiar with in clinical CT.\n\nThis approach is robust, efficient, and reliable — and it has been the backbone of medical CT imaging for decades.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
