Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, once you have both the X-ray source and the detector, you can build an imaging system. Simply put, if you hold them together in the right configuration, you can start performing medical X-ray imaging.\n\nAt the heart of the system is the X-ray tube. This is the device that actually generates the X-rays. We will look at its working principle in more detail, but for now, just remember: the X-ray tube is the source that makes the entire imaging chain possible.\n\nSo, the first step in understanding X-ray imaging is to understand the X-ray source.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"s\": \"X-ray tube\",\n      \"p\": \"produces\",\n      \"o\": \"X-rays\",\n      \"modalities\": [\n        \"text\",\n        \"image\"\n      ],\n      \"confidence\": 0.9,\n      \"evidence\": \"The X-ray tube is the device that actually generates the X-rays.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"s\": \"X-ray source\",\n      \"p\": \"represents\",\n      \"o\": \"X-ray tube\",\n      \"modalities\": [\n        \"text\",\n        \"image\"\n      ],\n      \"confidence\": 0.9,\n      \"evidence\": \"At the heart of the system is the X-ray tube.
