Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo far, we’ve discussed how X-rays are attenuated as they pass through tissue. \n\nNow let’s see how this attenuation creates contrast in an image. Imagine a piece of tissue that is mostly uniform, but with a small bump or nodule inside it. The X-ray beam passing through the normal tissue travels a distance x. \nIts signal is attenuated according to the exponential law:\nA = N naught e to the power of minus μ x.\nNow consider the ray that passes through the nodule. This ray travels an additional thickness, z. Its output is therefore:\nB = N naught e to the power of minus μ (x plus z).\nThe contrast is defined as the difference between the normal signal and the signal through the nodule, divided by the normal signal. Doing the math, we find:\nContrast = 1 minus e to the power of minus μ z.\nNotice that the contrast depends only on μ, the attenuation coefficient, and z, the extra thickness of the nodule.\n\nFor example, if the nodule is 1 centimeter thick, and μ equals 1 per centimeter, then the contrast comes out to about 63 percent. But in real soft tissue, μ is much smaller, closer to 0.2 per centimeter. In that case, the contrast becomes significantly lower, making small nodules much harder to detect.\n\nThis simple example shows the mechanism of attenuation contrast: the difference in signal arises because one path is slightly longer or passes through tissue with different attenuation properties. But in soft tissues, where μ values are close together, contrast can be very limited — and that is why techniques like contrast agents or advanced imaging methods are often necessary.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
