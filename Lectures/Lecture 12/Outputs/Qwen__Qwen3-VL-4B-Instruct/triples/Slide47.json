Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo here is the idea we are pursuing — a hybrid detector array.\n\nInstead of using only one type of detector, why not combine them? In this design, most pixels are traditional energy-integrating detectors, which provide strong grayscale signals with high efficiency. But we strategically insert photon-counting detectors at certain positions. These pixels give us the spectral information — the energy-resolved measurements that allow for material decomposition, K-edge imaging, and molecular contrast. By mixing the two, we get the best of both worlds: the robustness and speed of energy-integrating detectors, and the precision and specificity of photon-counting detectors.\n\nThis concept is similar to the retina analogy I mentioned earlier — rods and cones working together. The rods give high sensitivity, the cones give color. Likewise, here the integrating detectors give us the structural information, while the photon-counting detectors add rich spectral detail.\nWe have already published several papers on this hybrid design, and it represents an exciting direction for the next generation of CT technology.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
