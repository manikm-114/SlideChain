Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow we come to one of the most exciting applications of photon-counting CT, which is K-edge imaging.\n\nIf we are dealing only with the human body — tissues like bone, soft tissue, and water — then dual-energy CT is usually sufficient. With two basis materials, two measurements are enough to solve the equations, and you can predict the X-ray response at any energy level. That is why dual-energy imaging has been so successful in the clinic.\n\nBut the moment we introduce contrast agents — iodine, gadolinium, or gold nanoparticles — the situation changes. These materials have sharp K-edges at very specific energies. To detect and separate them reliably, we need true energy-resolved imaging.\nThat is exactly what a photon-counting detector provides. Instead of just two broad spectra, it measures photons across multiple energy bins. This allows us to do material decomposition and create chemically specific maps. In other words, we can actually tell apart iodine from calcium, or gold nanoparticles from bone, based on their spectral signatures.\n\nAnd this opens the door to something much more powerful: molecular and cellular imaging with CT. If you attach nanoparticles to specific molecular targets, photon-counting CT can visualize not just anatomy, but biology — at the molecular level.\nOf course, there are additional benefits. Photon-counting improves dose efficiency, reduces beam hardening, and increases spatial resolution. But in my mind, the major breakthrough is K-edge imaging: the ability to map contrast agents and even nanoparticles with chemical specificity.\nThis is why the field is so excited about photon-counting CT — it takes X-ray imaging beyond anatomy and into biology.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
