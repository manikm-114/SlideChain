Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nBy now, you understand how X-rays are generated. That knowledge positions you well, not only for deeper research in this field but also for practical discussions, even in job interviews.\n\nNow we move to the next important part of the imaging chain — X-ray attenuation. Once X-rays are produced by the tube, or in some cases by a synchrotron radiation source, we use them to probe an object or a patient. As the X-rays travel through matter, some of them are absorbed, some are scattered, and some pass through with little interaction.\n\nIt’s in this process — the way X-rays are attenuated by different tissues or materials — that valuable diagnostic information is encoded. Understanding attenuation is crucial because it directly determines the contrast and quality of the images we can produce.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"s\": \"X-ray attenuation\",\n      \"p\": \"represents\",\n      \"o\": \"diagnostic information\",\n      \"modalities\": [\n        \"text\"\n      ],\n      \"confidence\": 0.9,\n      \"evidence\": \"It’s in this process — the way X-rays are attenuated by different tissues or materials — that valuable diagnostic information is encoded.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"s\": \"X-ray attenuation\",\n      \"p\": \"depends_on\",\n      \"o\": \"X-ray Source\",\n      \"modalities\": [\n        \"text\"\n      ],\n      \"confidence\": 0.8,\n      \"evidence\": \"Once X-rays are produced by the tube, or in some cases by a synchrotron radiation source, we use them to probe an object or a patient.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"s\": \"X-ray attenuation\",\n      \"p\": \"measures\",\n      \"o\": \"contrast and quality of images\",\n      \"modalities\": [\n        \"text\"\n      ],\n      \"confidence\": 0.8,\n      \"evidence\": \"Understanding attenuation is crucial because it directly determines the contrast and quality of the images we can produce.\"",
