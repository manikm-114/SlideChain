From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nIf we narrow down within the electromagnetic spectrum, we can clearly see where X-rays sit. Their wavelengths are extremely small, ranging roughly from one-tenth of a nanometer up to ten nanometers. Within this narrow window, we classify radiation as X-rays.\n\nBut not all X-rays are the same. When the frequency is higher — and remember, higher frequency means higher energy — we call them hard X-rays. When the frequency is lower, corresponding to longer wavelengths, the energy is weaker, and we call them soft X-rays.\n\nDifferent kinds of X-rays are useful for different applications. For example, in mammography, we use relatively soft X-rays because we want sensitivity to soft tissue structures. But if we want to penetrate thicker parts of the body or denser tissues like bone, we need hard X-rays, with energies that can go above 100 kilo-electron-volts.\n\nIn non-medical settings, even higher-energy X-rays are used. For example, in airport security screening, luggage may be very thick or contain dense objects. In those cases, stronger X-rays are required; otherwise, all the radiation would be absorbed, and no useful information would come out. So, depending on the wavelength and energy, X-rays can be tuned for very different purposes — from delicate imaging in medicine to powerful scanning in security.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
