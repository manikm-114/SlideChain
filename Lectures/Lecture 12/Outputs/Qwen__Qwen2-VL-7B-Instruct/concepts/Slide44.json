From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAnd let me close with this very exciting development.\nJust last year, a major paper was published in the journal Radiology. This study, conducted by a team of physicians in collaboration with Siemens, reported the first human experience with contrast-enhanced photon-counting CT.\n\nWhat does this mean? For the very first time, we are seeing photon-counting CT applied in real clinical imaging of patients — not just phantoms or animal models. The results demonstrated the feasibility and advantages of this new detector technology, including improved contrast, better noise performance, and the ability to separate materials with high precision.\n\nSo this is a milestone. What we have been discussing — from X-ray physics, to attenuation, to detector evolution, to dual-energy imaging, and finally photon-counting — is not just a research vision anymore. It is becoming a clinical reality.\nThis is where the field is going. And as engineers and scientists, your understanding of these fundamental principles will position you to contribute to the next generation of medical imaging.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
