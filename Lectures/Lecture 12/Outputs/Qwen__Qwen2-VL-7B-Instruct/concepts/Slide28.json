From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s extend the exponential attenuation model to the case where the X-ray beam passes through multiple elements along its path.\n\nSuppose the beam is divided into many small steps. For each step, there is a local attenuation coefficient and a thickness. When we add up all of these contributions, we arrive at a cumulative relationship.\nThis summation has a special name: we call it a ray-sum. The term simply means we are summing up contributions along a single ray of X-rays as it travels through the object.\n\nNow, notice what is known and what is unknown. The thickness of each element is something we set in the model. What we don’t know are the attenuation coefficients themselves — those are the values we are trying to determine. So, what we really have is a linear combination of unknowns. That’s why this is described as a linear system.\n\nOn the other side of the equation, you see a logarithm. Taking the natural logarithm is just a mathematical way of undoing the exponential law we started with. This step allows us to link the unknown attenuation values inside the body with quantities we can actually measure.\nThink about it: the input intensity is known because we generate and calibrate the X-ray beam. The output intensity is measured directly by the detector. The ratio of the two gives us a measurable value, and taking the logarithm turns it into the sum of attenuation along the path.\nIf we make the elements smaller and smaller, the discrete sum becomes a continuous integral. In other words, in the limit, what we measure is a line integral of the attenuation coefficient along the path of the X-ray.\n\nThis is the key principle: with X-rays, we do not directly measure the attenuation at each point inside the body. Instead, we measure ray-sums — overlapping signals that represent line integrals. By collecting many such measurements from different angles, we can mathematically reconstruct the image.\nSo this linear equation forms the bridge between the unknown interior of the body and the measurable data at the detector.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
