From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s take a closer look at how an X-ray tube works, because this is the heart of the X-ray source. The figure you see here illustrates the essential components.\n\nAt one end, we have a filament, which is usually made of tungsten wire. The filament is coiled so that it has more surface area, and when we pass a strong current through it, the wire becomes extremely hot. This heating process frees up electrons — they become “boiled off” from the surface of the filament.\nNext, we apply a very high voltage potential between the filament, which serves as the cathode, and the target, which is called the anode. The anode is also made of tungsten. The electric field between the cathode and the anode accelerates the electrons at very high speeds toward the tungsten target.\n\nWhen these high-energy electrons strike the anode, their interactions with the tungsten atoms produce X-rays. This process also generates an enormous amount of heat. In fact, more than 99 percent of the energy is converted into heat, and less than one percent actually becomes X-rays.\nManaging this heat is a major engineering challenge. The inside of the tube is kept under a high vacuum so that electrons can move freely without colliding with air molecules. But even in a vacuum, the tungsten target would quickly overheat if it were not carefully designed. The solution is to use a rotating anode. By spinning the target rapidly, the electron beam does not strike the same spot continuously. Instead, the heat is spread over a larger area, preventing the tungsten from melting.\n\nModern X-ray tubes are sealed inside durable glass or ceramic housings and are manufactured with extremely high precision. My colleagues at GE Global Research, for example, have worked on these tubes for many years, refining the design step by step. While the basic principle has remained the same since Röntgen’s time, continuous improvements have made the tubes more efficient, more powerful, and capable of delivering the high flux of X-rays needed in today’s imaging systems.\n\nSo in summary: heat the filament, release electrons, accelerate them with high voltage toward a tungsten anode, and X-rays are generated at the point of impact.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
