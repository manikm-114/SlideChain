From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, once you have both the X-ray source and the detector, you can build an imaging system. Simply put, if you hold them together in the right configuration, you can start performing medical X-ray imaging.\n\nAt the heart of the system is the X-ray tube. This is the device that actually generates the X-rays. We will look at its working principle in more detail, but for now, just remember: the X-ray tube is the source that makes the entire imaging chain possible.\n\nSo, the first step in understanding X-ray imaging is to understand the X-ray source.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
