From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo here is a classic expression for the X-ray attenuation coefficient.\n\nThe main idea is that attenuation comes from two parts: one part is the photoelectric effect, and the other part is Compton scattering.\nThe photoelectric effect is very strongly dependent on energy. In fact, as the X-ray energy increases, the contribution from the photoelectric effect drops very quickly — that’s why low-energy X-rays are absorbed much more.\n\nThe Compton scattering term, on the other hand, has a more gradual dependence on energy. It comes from what is called the Klein–Nishina function, which describes how photons scatter off electrons. So if you put these two terms together, you can describe the full attenuation as a combination of photoelectric absorption and Compton scattering. Now here’s the powerful part: if we measure attenuation at two different X-ray energy spectra, we can separate these two contributions. Once that’s done, we can predict how the material would behave at any other energy.\n\nYou can think about this in two ways:\nPhysically, we are separating attenuation into its two main mechanisms: photoelectric and Compton.\nMaterial-wise, we are saying that the body can be thought of as a mixture of two basic materials — for example, water and bone. Any other tissue can be represented as a combination of those two.\n\nThat’s the foundation of dual-energy CT: by using two X-ray spectra, we can get material-specific information, not just grayscale attenuation.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
