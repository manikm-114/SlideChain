From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, let’s ask the question: why is it that an X-ray tube can actually generate X-rays? The answer lies in two main physical mechanisms. This is what I call our first “red diamond,” or key concept.\n\nThe first mechanism is called Bremsstrahlung radiation, a German word meaning “braking radiation.” Here’s what happens: a primary electron beam, accelerated toward the target, passes close to the nucleus of a tungsten atom. Because the nucleus is positively charged and the electron is negatively charged, there is an attractive force. This force bends the trajectory of the electron. Whenever a charged particle is accelerated or decelerated, it gives off radiation. In this case, that radiation is X-rays. Since the amount of bending can vary, the emitted X-rays span a continuous range of energies. That’s why Bremsstrahlung is also called continuous radiation.\n\nThe second mechanism is called characteristic radiation, sometimes explained in terms of the photoelectric effect. In this case, a high-energy primary electron collides with an inner-shell electron of the tungsten atom and kicks it out of its orbit. That leaves a vacancy in the inner shell. An outer-shell electron then drops down to fill the gap. The energy difference between the two shells is released in the form of an X-ray photon. Because the energy levels of atomic shells are discrete, the emitted X-ray has a very specific energy — a “characteristic” value that depends on the target material.\n\nSo, to summarize: Bremsstrahlung gives us a broad, continuous X-ray spectrum, while characteristic radiation adds sharp peaks at specific energies. Together, these two processes explain how an X-ray tube produces the mixture of radiation that we use for imaging.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
