From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAlright, before we wrap up today’s lecture, let me leave you with the homework assignment.\nFrom now on, we’ll be following the green textbook as our main reference. Each week I’ll select a few problems that are especially useful for reinforcing the key concepts we’ve covered.\n\nFor this week, please work on the following three problems:\nPage 50, Problem 1.1\nPage 51, Problem 1.3\nPage 51, Problem 1.6\nThese are not particularly difficult, but they will give you a chance to apply what we’ve discussed in class and make sure the ideas really sink in.\n\nSo much for today’s lecture — thank you, and I’ll see you in the next class.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Reject filler or administrative text.\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"Page 50, Problem 1.1\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"Page 51, Problem 1.3\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"Page 51, Problem 1.6\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"These are not particularly difficult, but they will give you a chance to apply what we’ve discussed in class and make sure the ideas really sink in.\"]\n}",
