From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nWe saw this briefly back in the first lecture, but let’s look again. This is a standard X-ray radiograph — in this case, a chest X-ray. It’s a single two-dimensional projection of the body, captured on film or in digital form.\n\nWhat you see here is everything superimposed: the heart, the lungs, the ribs — all layered on top of each other in the same image. Because of that overlap, radiography is not always the clearest view. Still, it provides valuable insight into the human body.\nFor example, if a patient has a broken bone or if there is a foreign object like a bullet, it shows up immediately. That’s why radiography is so important in emergency rooms — it’s fast, widely available, and gives doctors a quick look inside.\n\nBut keep in mind, this is only a projected view. Moving from projection imaging, like radiography, to cross-sectional imaging, like CT, was a huge leap forward in the field of medical imaging.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
