Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s describe X-ray attenuation in a more quantitative way.\n\nImagine a beam of X-ray photons entering a small region of tissue. You can think of this region as a pixel, a tiny picture element made of uniform material. The number of photons that enter is what we call the input intensity. The number that comes out on the other side is the output intensity.\n\nThe relationship between the input and output depends on two key factors. First, the property of the material, which we describe using the linear attenuation coefficient, written as the Greek letter mu. Second, the thickness of the material, which we call delta x.\nPutting this together, the output intensity equals the input intensity multiplied by an exponential decay term. In plain language, this means that as the X-ray beam passes through the tissue, the number of photons drops off exponentially with thickness.\nThis exponential law comes directly from solving a first-order differential equation. The idea is simple: if you look at a very thin layer, only a small fraction of the photons are absorbed, proportional to the thickness. Stack up many thin layers, and the result naturally becomes exponential.\nIn fact, this same mathematical behavior appears in many other fields — chemical reactions, radioactive decay, and even population growth or decline.\n\nNow, in the human body, the situation is more complex because the X-ray beam usually passes through several tissues with different properties. In that case, the output is determined by the combined attenuation from all of them along the path.\nThis exponential attenuation law is fundamental to X-ray imaging. It is the mathematical backbone of both radiography and CT, because it precisely tells us how X-ray photons are reduced as they traverse the body.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
