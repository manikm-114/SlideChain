Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere is an inspiring analogy from biology. This is a microscopic view of the vertebrate retina — truly an amazing design. You can see the two main types of photoreceptors: the rods and the cones.\n\nRods are highly sensitive to light intensity. They help us see in dim light, but they do not provide color information. In a way, they are like the energy-integrating detectors we discussed earlier — they sum up all incoming light, or in our case, x-ray energy.\nCones, on the other hand, are responsible for color vision. They are less sensitive to intensity but can distinguish between red, green, and blue. In other words, they are like photon-counting detectors — slower, but capable of providing spectral, or energy-specific, information.\n\nSo why does the human retina use both? Because together, they give us a complete picture. Rods allow us to detect faint light with high sensitivity, while cones let us see rich color details.\n\nThis hybrid approach is exactly the idea being explored in modern CT technology — combining energy-integrating detectors for strong, high-flux signals with photon-counting detectors for detailed spectral information. Nature shows us that using both types of detectors in parallel can be the most efficient design.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
