Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere we see the overall picture of how X-ray photons interact with matter. At the atomic level, these interactions can be grouped into four main categories.\n\nThe first case is no interaction. The photon simply passes through the material unchanged. You could say the photon gets “lucky” — it doesn’t collide with anything. That photon contributes to the primary beam that reaches the detector.\nThe second case is total absorption, also known as the photoelectric effect. Here, the photon is completely absorbed by an atom. It transfers all its energy to an inner electron, which is ejected as a photoelectron. The atom is left with a vacancy, and when electrons from higher shells fall into that vacancy, characteristic X-rays can be emitted.\n\nThe other two cases involve scattering. In coherent, or Rayleigh scattering, the photon is deflected at a very small angle, but its energy remains the same. Because the frequency and phase of the photon do not change, we call this coherent scattering.\nIn contrast, incoherent scattering, also called Compton scattering, happens when the photon collides with an outer-shell electron and transfers part of its energy to it. The electron is ejected, and the photon is scattered at a larger angle with reduced energy. The energy lost by the photon is taken up by the electron and eventually dissipates as heat.\n\nFor medical imaging, the two most important interactions are the photoelectric effect and Compton scattering. The photoelectric effect gives rise to absorption contrast, while Compton scattering dominates at higher energies and contributes to image noise and radiation dose.\nSo, to summarize: no interaction, total absorption, coherent scattering, and Compton scattering — these four categories describe the essential ways X-rays interact with tissue.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
