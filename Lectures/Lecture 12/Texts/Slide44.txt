And let me close with this very exciting development.
Just last year, a major paper was published in the journal Radiology. This study, conducted by a team of physicians in collaboration with Siemens, reported the first human experience with contrast-enhanced photon-counting CT.

What does this mean? For the very first time, we are seeing photon-counting CT applied in real clinical imaging of patients — not just phantoms or animal models. The results demonstrated the feasibility and advantages of this new detector technology, including improved contrast, better noise performance, and the ability to separate materials with high precision.

So this is a milestone. What we have been discussing — from X-ray physics, to attenuation, to detector evolution, to dual-energy imaging, and finally photon-counting — is not just a research vision anymore. It is becoming a clinical reality.
This is where the field is going. And as engineers and scientists, your understanding of these fundamental principles will position you to contribute to the next generation of medical imaging.
