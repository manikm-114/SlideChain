Looking into the future, X-ray imaging may become far more portable and accessible. Imagine carrying a powerful but compact X-ray device — perhaps even something integrated into a smartphone. It may sound futuristic, but nothing is stopping us from thinking outside the box.

One open question is how to make X-ray imaging as cheap and convenient as possible. Believe it or not, there are papers suggesting that even something as simple as peeling Scotch tape can generate X-rays under certain conditions. If you’re curious, you can look up this fascinating idea.
So while today we use large, expensive machines, the future may bring surprising and creative ways to generate and use X-rays. New ideas like these could turn out to be very important for both medicine and technology.
