This slide, taken from your textbook, shows some important parameters of the X-ray tube.

Let’s start with the cathode. In practice, the cathode is often shaped in a particular way and charged so that it helps to focus the electron beam. Sometimes, additional focusing coils are also placed in the middle region. The purpose is always the same — to narrow the electron beam and concentrate it onto a small area of the anode. That small region becomes the X-ray focal spot.

Why is the focal spot size important? If the spot is too large, X-rays are emitted from a broad area, and the resulting image becomes blurry, similar to motion blur in photography. A smaller focal spot, on the other hand, produces much sharper images.

There’s also a clever design trick here called the line-focus principle. The anode surface is angled at some angle, theta. The electrons strike the sloped surface, and X-rays are emitted. Because of the geometry, the apparent or effective focal spot size is equal to the actual size times the sine of theta. This way, you can achieve a smaller effective focal spot while still spreading the heat over a larger physical area. It’s a neat compromise between sharp imaging and thermal management.

Finally, the field of view, or coverage, depends on the distance from the focal spot to the patient. As the patient moves farther away, the coverage widens. The maximum coverage is limited by the anode angle.
So, to summarize: focusing gives us a sharp spot, the angled anode helps reduce blur while managing heat, and the geometry of the tube determines how wide a field of view we can capture.
