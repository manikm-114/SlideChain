Now let’s look a little closer at how a photon-counting detector actually works.

In many ways, the design is similar to direct detection. An incoming X-ray photon interacts with a semiconductor material — typically cadmium telluride, or cadmium zinc telluride. This interaction generates an electron-hole pair. Under an applied bias voltage, those charges are quickly separated, creating a tiny current impulse.

Now here is the critical part: in a photon-counting detector, the electronics are extremely fast and sensitive. Each X-ray photon produces its own electrical pulse. That pulse is then compared against a series of preset thresholds.
If the pulse amplitude falls between two thresholds — say, between the fifth and the sixth — we know immediately that the energy of that X-ray photon lies within that range. In other words, the detector doesn’t just say “I saw a photon.” It also says, “I saw a photon in this specific energy band.”

What you see in this diagram is the circuit pathway: the signal is amplified, shaped, compared against thresholds, and then counted in real time. This entire process happens at the pixel level. And today’s state-of-the-art photon-counting detectors can have pixels as small as 55 microns. Each pixel has its own miniature readout circuit, often called an ASIC — an application-specific integrated circuit. Inside each ASIC are hundreds or thousands of transistors, all designed for high-speed, low-noise performance.

This is truly high-tech engineering. And the result is not just a count of how many photons arrive, but a spectrum of how those photons are distributed across energy ranges. That is what enables spectral CT — the next generation beyond conventional CT.
