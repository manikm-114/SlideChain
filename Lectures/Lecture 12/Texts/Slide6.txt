X-rays are a special type of electromagnetic radiation. They occupy a specific portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.

The part of the spectrum we are most familiar with is visible light, because we can see it with our eyes. But just because we cannot see other forms of electromagnetic radiation does not mean they don’t exist. Think about your smartphone. You don’t see the electromagnetic waves, but you constantly receive emails, messages, and photos from anywhere in the world. These are all carried by electromagnetic radiation.
Electromagnetic waves are beautifully described by Maxwell’s equations. They are sinusoidal waves traveling through space, with an electric field and a magnetic field that are perpendicular to each other. Together, they form the foundation for how light and all electromagnetic radiation behave.

Now, across this wide spectrum, different portions can be used for different purposes. For example, X-rays are used for radiography and CT imaging. Gamma rays are used in nuclear imaging, like PET and SPECT. Infrared and visible light are used for optical imaging and pathology. Radio waves and microwaves are used in magnetic resonance imaging. So, depending on the wavelength and frequency, each portion of the spectrum serves a different role in medicine.

To describe the energy of electromagnetic radiation, we use a fundamental relationship:E equals h times f, which is also equal to h c over lambda.
Here, h is Planck’s constant, f is frequency, c is the speed of light, and lambda is the wavelength. From this equation, you can see that energy is directly proportional to frequency and inversely proportional to wavelength.

In medical imaging, we work with very small wavelengths, usually measured in nanometers and angstroms. One nanometer is 10 to the power of minus 9 meters. One angstrom, written as a small circle above the letter A, is even smaller — 10 to the power of minus 10 meters.
So this slide shows you clearly where X-rays fit in the electromagnetic spectrum, and why their energy levels make them so useful for medical imaging.
