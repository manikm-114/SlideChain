Before we go further into dual-energy imaging, let’s pause for a quick review of some basic chemistry concepts—specifically, the atomic number and the mass number, because these concepts form the physical foundation of dual-energy CT.

The atomic number, usually denoted by Z, is simply the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom. It defines the identity of the element. For example, hydrogen has Z = 1, helium has Z = 2, carbon has Z = 6, and so on. If you change Z, you change the element itself.
The mass number, often written as A, is approximately the total number of protons plus neutrons in the nucleus. Since neutrons contribute to the mass but not the charge, A is usually larger than Z.
Take helium as an example. Helium has Z = 2, meaning two protons. Most stable helium atoms also have two neutrons, giving a mass number of A = 4. That’s why you see the helium symbol here written with a 2 at the bottom and a 4 at the top.

So why is this important for us? Because the way X-rays interact with matter—whether through photoelectric absorption or Compton scattering—depends strongly on both the atomic number and the mass of the element. High atomic number elements like iodine, gadolinium, or gold interact with X-rays very differently from soft tissue, which is mostly carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen.
And this difference is exactly what dual-energy imaging exploits: by probing tissues at two different energy levels, we can begin to separate and even identify different materials inside the body.
