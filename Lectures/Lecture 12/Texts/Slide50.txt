Alright, before we wrap up today’s lecture, let me leave you with the homework assignment.
From now on, we’ll be following the green textbook as our main reference. Each week I’ll select a few problems that are especially useful for reinforcing the key concepts we’ve covered.

For this week, please work on the following three problems:
Page 50, Problem 1.1
Page 51, Problem 1.3
Page 51, Problem 1.6
These are not particularly difficult, but they will give you a chance to apply what we’ve discussed in class and make sure the ideas really sink in.

So much for today’s lecture — thank you, and I’ll see you in the next class.
