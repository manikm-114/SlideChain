A very important concept in X-ray imaging is the K-edge of the linear attenuation coefficient.

Now remember, μ — the attenuation coefficient — is not a single fixed number. It depends strongly on the energy of the X-rays. In general, as energy increases, X-rays penetrate more easily, so the attenuation coefficient gradually decreases.

But at certain energies, something special happens. When the X-ray energy becomes high enough to knock out inner-shell electrons — specifically, K-shell electrons — the attenuation suddenly increases. This produces a sharp jump in the attenuation curve, known as the K-edge.
This feature is element-specific. Each element has its own characteristic K-edge energy. For example, in gold, the K-edge occurs at about 80.7 keV. That means if the X-ray photon energy just crosses this threshold, gold absorbs much more strongly due to the photoelectric effect.
This is very powerful because it allows us to do chemically specific imaging. If we use detectors that can resolve X-ray energy, we can identify where particular elements are present based on their K-edge signatures. This opens the door to material decomposition and even molecular-level imaging.

In current hospital CT systems, detectors typically integrate over all energies. That’s like measuring the total area under the attenuation curve — you get a grayscale value, but not the details of the energy dependence. However, with modern energy-sensitive detectors, we can directly measure the shape of the curve. That means we can distinguish materials that would otherwise look similar in a conventional CT scan.
This concept is especially important for contrast agents. Elements like iodine, gadolinium, and gold nanoparticles all have distinct K-edges. With energy-resolved imaging, we can separate their signals, perform quantitative mapping, and even design targeted nanoparticle-based contrast agents for advanced molecular imaging.

So the K-edge is not just a physics detail — it’s the foundation for the future of spectral CT and molecular X-ray imaging.
