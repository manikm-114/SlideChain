So far, we’ve discussed how X-rays are attenuated as they pass through tissue. 

Now let’s see how this attenuation creates contrast in an image. Imagine a piece of tissue that is mostly uniform, but with a small bump or nodule inside it. The X-ray beam passing through the normal tissue travels a distance x. 
Its signal is attenuated according to the exponential law:
A = N naught e to the power of minus μ x.
Now consider the ray that passes through the nodule. This ray travels an additional thickness, z. Its output is therefore:
B = N naught e to the power of minus μ (x plus z).
The contrast is defined as the difference between the normal signal and the signal through the nodule, divided by the normal signal. Doing the math, we find:
Contrast = 1 minus e to the power of minus μ z.
Notice that the contrast depends only on μ, the attenuation coefficient, and z, the extra thickness of the nodule.

For example, if the nodule is 1 centimeter thick, and μ equals 1 per centimeter, then the contrast comes out to about 63 percent. But in real soft tissue, μ is much smaller, closer to 0.2 per centimeter. In that case, the contrast becomes significantly lower, making small nodules much harder to detect.

This simple example shows the mechanism of attenuation contrast: the difference in signal arises because one path is slightly longer or passes through tissue with different attenuation properties. But in soft tissues, where μ values are close together, contrast can be very limited — and that is why techniques like contrast agents or advanced imaging methods are often necessary.
