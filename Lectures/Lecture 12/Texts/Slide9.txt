Here we have X-ray computed tomography, or CT. Unlike a simple radiograph, CT allows us to see a clear cross-sectional view of the body. With CT, the resolution can be extremely fine, down to about 300 microns, which is three-tenths of a millimeter. That means we can visualize very small structures and details inside the body.

How do we actually make a cross-sectional image from X-rays? That is the central question of CT, and it will be the focus of our next lecture. For now, I just want to give you a sense of how powerful this technology is.
When you see images like this, you realize how useful X-ray imaging can be. Hopefully, this motivates you to dig deeper — to understand how the X-ray source, the detectors, and the reconstruction process all work together to extract as much information as possible from the human body.
