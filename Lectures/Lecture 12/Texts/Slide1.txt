Last time, we talked about image quality assessment.Today, we begin a new part of the course — focusing on imaging modalities. And the very first modality we will discuss is X-ray imaging.
Before we dive in, let me share a quick study tip. When you are learning a subject as complex as medical imaging, it is really important to build good habits: preview the material before class, review it after class, and pay special attention to the key ideas. I will repeat important concepts as needed to reinforce your understanding.

Earlier in the course, I showed you a poster that summarized the foundation of medical imaging. I also created a similar poster for my graduate-level class, and students really liked it. These visual maps help connect the big picture with the details.
Tools like this can make complicated subjects easier to follow.

So with that in mind, let’s move forward and begin our journey into X-ray radiography.
