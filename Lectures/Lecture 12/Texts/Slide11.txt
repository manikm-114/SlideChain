You may remember this TED-Ed video, “How X-rays See Through Your Skin,” which I showed you earlier. When I first shared it, it already had a large number of views, and since then, the count has only grown. That tells you how many people around the world are curious about the history and the science of X-rays.

It’s a short, engaging explanation of how X-rays work, and I encourage you to watch it again after today’s lecture. With the background you now have, you may notice details you didn’t fully appreciate before. Revisiting resources like this, once you have more context, is a great way to deepen your understanding.
