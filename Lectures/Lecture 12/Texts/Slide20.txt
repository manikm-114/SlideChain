We’ve now reviewed the conventional X-ray tube, its parameters, and how it works. Let me briefly mention a new type of X-ray tube, which represents a more advanced and expensive technology.
Instead of using a solid tungsten anode, this design uses a liquid metal anode. A thin jet of liquid metal flows continuously downward. An electron beam, generated in a way similar to what we discussed before, strikes the liquid metal stream. The interaction between the electrons and the liquid target produces X-rays.

The advantage of this design is that the liquid metal can absorb and dissipate heat much more effectively than a solid target. As a result, the system can generate a much brighter X-ray beam — higher intensity and higher flux — without destroying the anode.
These tubes are very costly, often priced in the range of hundreds of thousands of dollars. We won’t test you on the details of this system, but it’s good to be aware of such innovations. They illustrate how researchers continue to push the limits of X-ray technology, refining designs to achieve better performance.

I should also add a deeper point for you to think about. When we describe Bremsstrahlung radiation, it may sound puzzling: electrons are attracted to the nucleus, so at one stage they seem to gain energy, while at another stage they lose energy. How can net radiation be produced if these processes are symmetric? The key is that the trajectory of the electron is bent. That bending means the electron is accelerated in a new direction, and acceleration of charge always produces radiation. This is the fundamental physical basis — conservation laws and electromagnetic theory together explain why X-rays are emitted.

So, while the equations provide a clear description, it’s important to connect them with the underlying physics. That’s what allows us to understand not just how X-rays are generated, but also how new designs, like this liquid metal tube, can open the door to brighter and more efficient X-ray sources.
