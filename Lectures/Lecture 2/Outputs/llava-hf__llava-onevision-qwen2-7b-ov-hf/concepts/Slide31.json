From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nIn MATLAB, you can do both matrix and element-wise operations — and the difference is all in the dot.\n“A times B” — with a single star — means matrix multiplication.\u000b“A dot star B” — with a dot — means multiply element by element.\nSame goes for powers and division.\u000b“A caret 2” raises the matrix to a power.\u000b“A dot caret 2” squares each element.\u000bAnd for division, “A divided by B” solves equations, while “A dot slash B” divides element-wise.\nThese small differences are key when working with data, equations, or signals in MATLAB.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"matrix multiplication\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"element-wise multiplication\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"matrix power\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"element-wise power\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"matrix division\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"element-wise division\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"In MATLAB, you can do both matrix and element-wise operations — and the difference is all in the dot.\", \"A times B — with a single star — means matrix multiplication.\", \"A dot star B — with a dot — means multiply element by element.\", \"Same goes for powers and division.\", \"A caret 2 raises the matrix to a power.\", \"A dot caret 2 squares each element.\", \"And for division, “A divided by B” solves equations, while “A dot slash B” divides element-wise.\"]\n}\n```",
