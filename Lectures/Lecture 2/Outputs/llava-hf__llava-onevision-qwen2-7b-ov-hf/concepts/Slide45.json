From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s explore the Image Processing Toolbox.\nIt includes powerful tools for loading, modifying, analyzing, and segmenting images.\nYou can sharpen edges, enhance contrast, or isolate bright regions. It even lets you analyze object shapes and intensities — which is essential in fields like medical imaging.\nYou can also use it to register images, align features, and prepare large datasets for analysis. And if needed, you can even accelerate the workflow with C or C++ code.\nThis toolbox makes MATLAB a great platform for both learning and real-world applications in imaging.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"image processing\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"MATLAB\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"image analysis\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"image segmentation\", \"category\": \"image_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"medical imaging\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"image registration\", \"category\": \"image_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"C or C++ code\", \"category\": \"software\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"It includes powerful tools for loading, modifying, analyzing, and segmenting images.\", \n               \"You can sharpen edges, enhance contrast, or isolate bright regions.\", \n               \"It even lets you analyze object shapes and intensities — which is essential in fields like medical imaging.\", \n               \"You can also use it to register images, align features, and prepare large datasets for analysis.\", \n               \"And if needed, you can even accelerate the workflow with C or C++ code.\", \n               \"This toolbox makes MATLAB a great platform for both learning and real-world applications in imaging.\"]\n}\n```",
