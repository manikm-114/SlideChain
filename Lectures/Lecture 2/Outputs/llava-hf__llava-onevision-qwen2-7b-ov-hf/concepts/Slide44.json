From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere’s the full example, all in one place.\nWe define t as a vector with values zero, one, zero. Then we call the cylinder function to generate the geometry, and use surf to plot it.\nThat’s it — three lines of code give us a smooth 3D cone you can rotate, zoom, and customize. You can even add lights, shadows, or change the viewing angle.\nIt’s a simple example, but it shows the power of MATLAB for 3D visualization.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"MATLAB\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"3D visualization\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"cylinder function\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"surf\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"smooth 3D cone\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"rotate, zoom, customize\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"lights, shadows, viewing angle\", \"category\": \"software\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"It’s a simple example, but it shows the power of MATLAB for 3D visualization.\"]\n}\n```",
