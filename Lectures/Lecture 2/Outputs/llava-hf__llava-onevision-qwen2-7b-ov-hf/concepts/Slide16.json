From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAlright, let’s shift gears and talk about solving systems of linear equations — something that comes up all the time in engineering, physics, and, yes, even in medical imaging.\nSuppose we’re working with a system like A times x equals b. Now, you might think — okay, just take the inverse of A and multiply it by b. So, x equals inv of A times b.\nAnd sure, that’s mathematically valid — but in practice, it’s a bad idea. It’s slow, it’s unstable, and it can lead to all kinds of numerical issues, especially with large or ill-conditioned matrices.\nInstead, MATLAB gives us a much better tool: the backslash operator. So we write x equals A backslash b. This tells MATLAB to choose the most efficient way to solve the system behind the scenes — no explicit inverse needed.\nLater on, we’ll learn how to implement our own solvers, but for now, this built-in method is what you should use. It’s clean, fast, and accurate — everything we want.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"backslash operator\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"MATLAB\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"systems of linear equations\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"inverse\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"numerical issues\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"solvers\", \"category\": \"algorithm\"},\n    {\"term\": \"built-in method\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"clean, fast, and accurate\", \"category\": \"software\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"Suppose we’re working with a system like A times x equals b.
