From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nWelcome to this session, where we’ll begin exploring MATLAB — one of the most widely used computational platforms in science and engineering, especially in biomedical imaging.\nThis will serve as your gateway to MATLAB: how it works, why we use it, and how it helps us handle real-world data. You don’t need any prior experience — we’ll start with the basics and build up step by step.\nAs we move forward, you’ll use MATLAB to generate signals, reconstruct images, and analyze datasets — all key tasks in medical imaging. The goal is not just to learn syntax, but to develop intuition and confidence in working with computational tools that are directly relevant to biomedical research and clinical practice.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"MATLAB\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"computational platform\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"biomedical imaging\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"signals\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"images\", \"category\": \"reconstruction\"},\n    {\"term\": \"datasets\", \"category\": \"data_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"computational tools\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"biomedical research\", \"category\": \"workflow\"},\n    {\"term\": \"clinical practice\", \"category\": \"workflow\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"Welcome to this session, where we’ll begin exploring MATLAB — one of the most widely used computational platforms in science and engineering, especially in biomedical imaging.\", \n             \"This will serve as your gateway to MATLAB: how it works, why we use it, and how it helps us handle real-world data.\", \n             \"You don’t need any prior experience — we’ll start with the basics and build up step by step.\", \n             \"As we move forward, you’ll use MATLAB to generate signals, reconstruct images, and analyze datasets",
