From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nOne of the key ideas in MATLAB is that everything is a matrix.\nA single number? That’s just a one-by-one matrix.\u000bA row of numbers is a row vector. A column is a column vector.\u000bAnd an image? That’s a two-dimensional matrix.\u000bIf it’s in color, it becomes three-dimensional — width, height, and color channels.\nThis matrix mindset makes MATLAB powerful and consistent across tasks — whether you're doing math, image processing, or even machine learning.\nNow, let’s talk about indexing. If you have a matrix A:\u000bA of i comma j gives the element in row i and column j.\u000bA of i comma colon gives the entire i-th row.\u000bA of colon comma j gives the whole j-th column.\nYou can reshape matrices, slice out parts, or use logical masks to filter data.\nTo modify the matrix, use expressions like A plus five — which adds five to every element.\u000bOr A dot star B — for element-by-element multiplication.\nThis is the foundation of MATLAB — matrix thinking in everything you do\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"matrix\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"MATLAB\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"indexing\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"reshape\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"slice\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"logical mask\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"expression\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"A plus five\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"A dot star B\", \"category\": \"software\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"One of the key ideas in MATLAB is that everything is a matrix.\", \"A single number?
