  "raw_output": "user \nSystem:\nYou are an expert educator in medical imaging. From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nWe are right on schedule in our journey through this material.\n\nIf you’ve already previewed the reading materials related to today’s lecture, excellent! That head start will help you connect concepts more easily. If not, no worries. I do encourage you to follow along closely and review key ideas afterward. This habit of reinforcing concepts as you progress will help you build a stronger, more intuitive understanding, especially as the ideas become more mathematically involved.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"journey\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"reading materials\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"connect concepts\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"review\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"reinforcing concepts\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"stronger, more intuitive understanding\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"more mathematically involved\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"connect concepts\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"more mathematically involved\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"connect concepts\", \"category\": \"frequency_domain\"},\n    {\"term\": \"more mathematically involved\", \"category\": \"frequency_domain\"},\n    {\"term\": \"connect concepts\", \"category\": \"physics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"more mathematically involved\", \"category\": \"physics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"connect concepts\", \"category\": \"instrumentation\"},\n    {\"term\": \"more mathematically involved\", \"category\": \"instrumentation\"},\n    {\"term\": \"connect concepts\", \"",
