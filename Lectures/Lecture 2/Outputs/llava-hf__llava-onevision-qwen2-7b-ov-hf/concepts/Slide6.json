From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet me walk you through what we’ll cover in this lab module.\nWe’ll start by getting MATLAB installed on your machine. Once it’s up and running, you’ll go through the module MATLAB On Ramp — an interactive tutorial that introduces the core features of the platform in a hands-on way.\nNext, we’ll work through two examples that show MATLAB in action. First, we’ll look at spectral shifts of starlight — a great illustration of how MATLAB can be used in astrophysics. Then, we’ll switch gears to generate a 3D cone surface, which introduces MATLAB’s powerful graphics.\nAnd once you’ve the basics, we can take steps further. As good examples, we can explore several advanced MATLAB toolboxes — like image processing, instrument control, optimization, statistics and machine learning, and symbolic computation. These toolboxes allow MATLAB to go far beyond basic math and become a most powerful scientific computing platform.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
