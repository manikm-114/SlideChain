From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s talk about reading and writing data files.\nTo open a file, use f open, and pass the file name and read mode.\u000bFor example: f open in dot dat, r t.\nThis gives you a file ID — or fid.\nUse f scanf to read numbers from the file.\u000bWhen you're done, always close the file using f close.\nIf you need formatting help, use help textread or help f printf.\nBelow is an example of a data file — it has names, types, numbers, and yes or no labels.\nYou’ll often need to work with mixed data — so learning how to read from and write to files is essential in MATLAB workflows.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"f open\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"f scanf\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"f close\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"help textread\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"help f printf\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"data file\", \"category\": \"data_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"names, types, numbers, yes or no labels\", \"category\": \"data_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"mixed data\", \"category\": \"data_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"read from and write to files\", \"category\": \"data_processing\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"To open a file, use f open, and pass the file name and read mode.\", \n               \"Use f scanf to read numbers from the file.\", \n               \"When you're done, always close the file using f close.\", \n               \"If you need formatting help, use help textread or help f printf.\", \n               \"You’ll often need to work with mixed data — so learning how to read from and write to files is essential in MATLAB workflows.\"]\n}",
