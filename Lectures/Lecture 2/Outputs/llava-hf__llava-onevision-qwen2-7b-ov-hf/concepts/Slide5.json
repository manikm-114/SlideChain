From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s take a closer look at Octave.\nOctave is a scientific programming language that mirrors MATLAB’s syntax and functionality. It’s free, open-source, and available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. You can run it in the browser using Octave Online.\nThe interface looks different, but under the hood, many of the same commands will work — especially those used for basic matrix operations, plotting, and simple scripts. This makes Octave a reliable backup if MATLAB access is delayed or limited.\nWhile it might not support all specialized toolboxes or image processing features, it’s more than enough for getting started and building foundational skills, at least for this course.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"octave\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"matlab\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"matrix operations\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"plotting\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"scripts\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"reliable backup\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"MATLAB access\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"specialized toolboxes\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"image processing\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"foundational skills\", \"category\": \"software\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"Octave is a scientific programming language that mirrors MATLAB’s syntax and functionality.\", \n               \"It’s free, open-source, and available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.\", \n               \"You can run it in the browser using Octave Online.\", \n               \"The interface looks different, but under the hood, many of the same commands will work — especially those used for basic matrix operations, plotting, and simple scripts.\", \n               \"This makes Octave",
