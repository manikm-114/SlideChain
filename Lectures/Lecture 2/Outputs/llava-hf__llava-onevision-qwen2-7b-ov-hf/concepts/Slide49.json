From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThe Symbolic Math Toolbox brings exact math into MATLAB.\nInstead of working with numbers alone, you can define symbolic variables and compute exact derivatives, integrals, or solutions to equations.\nFor example, you can write a function like f of x equals x squared times sine x and ask MATLAB to find its derivative. You’ll get the answer in symbolic form — not an approximation.\nYou can also plot these expressions or export them into Simulink for simulation.\nIt’s a great toolbox for exploring math symbolically, especially in calculus and algebra-heavy problems.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"MATLAB\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"symbolic math\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"symbolic variables\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"exact math\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"derivatives\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"integrals\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"solutions to equations\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"plotting\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"Simulink\", \"category\": \"software\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"The Symbolic Math Toolbox brings exact math into MATLAB.\", \"You can define symbolic variables and compute exact derivatives, integrals, or solutions to equations.\", \"You can also plot these expressions or export them into Simulink for simulation.\"]\n}\n```",
