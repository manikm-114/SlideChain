Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nWe are right on schedule in our journey through this material.\n\nIf you’ve already previewed the reading materials related to today’s lecture, excellent! That head start will help you connect concepts more easily. If not, no worries. I do encourage you to follow along closely and review key ideas afterward. This habit of reinforcing concepts as you progress will help you build a stronger, more intuitive understanding, especially as the ideas become more mathematically involved.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"material\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"journey\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"We are right on schedule in our journey through this material.\"}\n  ]\n}",
