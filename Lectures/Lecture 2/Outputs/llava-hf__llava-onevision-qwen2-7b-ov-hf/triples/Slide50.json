Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nFinally, let’s talk about how to keep learning on your own.\nThere’s a helpful online tutorial by Dr. Azernikov that introduces MATLAB basics step by step. It’s clear and beginner-friendly — a great way to reinforce what we’ve learned here.\nAlso, don’t forget about MATLAB’s built-in help tools. If your cursor is on a command, just press F1. Or type help followed by the function name in the Command Window.\nFor more support, you can check the MathWorks website, Stack Overflow, or MATLAB Central. These are great places to ask questions and find real code examples.\nIn short — keep exploring, keep experimenting, and you'll keep getting better.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"MATLAB\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"online tutorial\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"Dr. Azernikov’s tutorial introduces MATLAB basics step by step.\"}\n  ]\n}",
