Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s look at a real-world scientific task — measuring how stars move.\nWe start with spectral data from a star. It includes many wavelengths, evenly spaced. The key is to find a feature called the Hydrogen-alpha line. If that line shifts, the star is moving — either away or toward us.\nWith MATLAB, we’ll identify that line, calculate how much it’s shifted, and then use the Doppler formula to estimate the star’s speed.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"Spectral data\", \"p\":\"measures\", \"o\":\"Hydrogen-alpha line\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"The key is to find a feature called the Hydrogen-alpha line.\"}\n  ]\n}",
