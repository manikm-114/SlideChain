Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s look at how MATLAB handles basic plots.\nStart by generating x values from minus one to one using linspace. Then take the sine of x to get y.\nUse plot x and y to create a basic line graph.\nTo change the appearance, you can specify style and color. For example, plot x, y, black line draws the line in black.\nUse hold on if you want to overlay another plot on the same figure.\u000bUse figure to open a new figure window for a separate plot.\nPlotting helps visualize data — and it’s built into MATLAB as a core strength.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"MATLAB\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"plot\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"Start by generating x values from minus one to one using linspace.
