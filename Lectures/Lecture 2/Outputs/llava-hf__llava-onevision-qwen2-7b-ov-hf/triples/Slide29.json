Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNext, let’s see how to keep a record of your work using the diary command.\nStart with diary followed by a filename. From that point on, everything you type and everything MATLAB prints will be saved in a log file. Once you’re done, stop the recording by typing diary off.\nThis is great for tracking your workflow, recording sessions, or saving what you’ve done for future reference or reporting.\nNow, another useful tool is timing. If you want to measure how long your code takes to run, just put tic before the commands, and toc after them. MATLAB will show you the elapsed time in seconds.\nThis helps you compare different methods and optimize performance.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"diary\", \"p\":\"uses\", \"o\":\"filename\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"Start with diary followed by a filename.
