Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nMATLAB also makes it easy to generate special-purpose matrices, which are often useful for setting up or testing algorithms.\nFor example, diag of v creates a diagonal matrix from a vector. You can also reverse it: diag of A pulls the diagonal elements from a matrix.\nIf you need an identity matrix — that’s a square matrix with ones on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere — just write eye of n.\nTo create a matrix full of zeros, use zeros of m and n. If you need one filled with ones, use ones of m and n.\nThese kinds of matrices are especially useful when initializing arrays before filling them with computed values.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"MATLAB\", \"p\":\"uses\", \"o\":\"special-purpose matrices\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"MATLAB also makes it easy to generate special-purpose matrices, which are often useful for setting up or testing algorithms.\"}\n  ]\n}",
