Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere’s a basic function example — one that calculates the area and circumference of a circle.\nWe define a function called circle that takes one input: the radius. Inside, we calculate the area as pi times radius squared, and the circumference as two times pi times the radius.\nSave this in a file named circle dot m.\nNow, to use this function, we write a script. For example, if the radius is 7, we call the function with that value and display the result using disp.\nYou’d save this script as myscript dot m.\nThis is how functions and scripts work together. You build reusable tools with functions and run them from scripts.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"circle\", \"p\":\"uses\", \"o\":\"radius\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"takes one input: the radius\"}\n  ]\n}",
