Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThe Symbolic Math Toolbox brings exact math into MATLAB.\nInstead of working with numbers alone, you can define symbolic variables and compute exact derivatives, integrals, or solutions to equations.\nFor example, you can write a function like f of x equals x squared times sine x and ask MATLAB to find its derivative. You’ll get the answer in symbolic form — not an approximation.\nYou can also plot these expressions or export them into Simulink for simulation.\nIt’s a great toolbox for exploring math symbolically, especially in calculus and algebra-heavy problems.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"MATLAB\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"Symbolic Math Toolbox\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"The Symbolic Math Toolbox brings exact math into MATLAB.\"}\n  ]\n}",
