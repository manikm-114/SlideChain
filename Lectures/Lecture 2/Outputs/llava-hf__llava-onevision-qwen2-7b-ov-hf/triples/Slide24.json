Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere are a few examples of what you can do with MATLAB plots.\nYou’ll see grouped bar charts, stacked bars, 2D lines, and 3D surfaces — all using basic commands.\nTry different styles, colors, and layouts to get the look you want.\nGood visualization tells a story — not just numbers, but patterns, relationships, and insights.\nUse plots not just to check results, but to communicate them clearly.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1].
