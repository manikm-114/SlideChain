Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s look at logical operations in MATLAB.\nYou can compare values using operators like:\u000bdouble equals, less than, greater than, or not equals, which is written as tilde equals.\nThe tilde symbol means not.\u000bFor combining conditions, use ampersand for AND, and vertical bar for OR.\nTo find specific values in an array, use the find function.\u000bFor example: find A equals three — gives you the positions where A is exactly three.\nThese logical tools are great for filtering data and writing conditional code.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1].
