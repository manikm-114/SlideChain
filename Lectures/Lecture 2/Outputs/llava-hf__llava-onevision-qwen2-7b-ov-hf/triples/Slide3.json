Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let me address a common issue students often encounter early on — installation problems with MATLAB.\nHere’s a message I received from a student. He was unable to install MATLAB on his computer because of authentication issues with CAS — something that happens occasionally, especially at the beginning of the semester. The good news is that this is fixable, and you’re not alone.\nIf you experience something similar, please reach out early. Visit the RPI Help Center, and they’ll assist you with installing MATLAB. And of course, please feel free to contact me or the teaching assistant — we’re here to help.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"student\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"CAS\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"The student encountered authentication issues with CAS during the installation of MATLAB.\"}\n  ]\n}",
