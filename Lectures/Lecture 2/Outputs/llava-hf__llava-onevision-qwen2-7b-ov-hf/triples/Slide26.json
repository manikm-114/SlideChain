Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s now learn how to read data files in MATLAB — both fully and partially.\nTo read an entire structured dataset, you first open the file using fopen, then use the textread function to extract data from all columns.\nEach data type in the file corresponds to a format symbol — like %s for strings, %f for floating-point numbers, and %d for integers. MATLAB assigns each column to a variable automatically.\nThis works well when you need to load the whole dataset into memory — like names, types, values, and so on.\nNow, if you only want to read part of the data — say just the first column — you can still use textread, but with asterisks added to the format string to skip over the columns you don’t need. MATLAB will still move through the file correctly, but it’ll only save the data you asked for.\nThis selective reading is great for reducing memory usage or focusing on relevant features.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"MATLAB\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"textread\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"Each data type in the file corresponds to a format symbol — like %s for strings, %f for floating-point numbers, and %d for integers.
