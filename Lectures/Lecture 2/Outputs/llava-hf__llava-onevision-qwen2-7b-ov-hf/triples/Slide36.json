Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s talk about the two main types of files you’ll create in MATLAB — scripts and functions.\nScripts are simple. They run a series of commands and use variables already in your workspace. You don’t pass anything in, and they don’t return anything out. They’re great for quick experiments or automation.\nFunctions, on the other hand, are more structured. You give them inputs, and they return outputs. Inside a function, all variables are local — meaning they don’t interfere with anything else in your workspace.\nKnowing when to use a script or a function is key to writing clean, reliable code.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"scripts\", \"p\":\"uses\", \"o\":\"MATLAB\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"They’re great for quick experiments or automation.\"}\n  ]\n}",
