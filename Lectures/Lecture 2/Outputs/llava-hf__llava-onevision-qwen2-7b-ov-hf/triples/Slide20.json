Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s talk about vectorization — one of the most important habits in MATLAB programming.\nHere’s the idea. Instead of looping through each element one by one, we apply an operation to the whole array at once.\nFor example:\u000bLet’s say x is the vector — one, two, three.\u000bUsing a loop, we would add five to each element, one at a time.\u000bBut with vectorization, we just say: x equals x plus five — and MATLAB does it all at once.\nSame result, much faster, much cleaner.\nWhenever you can, avoid loops. Use vectorized operations. MATLAB is built for that.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"vectorization\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"MATLAB programming\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"Now let’s talk about vectorization — one of the most important habits in MATLAB programming.\"}\n  ]\n}",
