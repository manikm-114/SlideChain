Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s try a simple numerical task: summing one over i squared, from i equals 1 to 10.\nWe can do this two ways — forward, starting from i equals 1, or backward, starting from i equals 10.\nThe code is nearly identical, just with the loop going in reverse.\nNow, in theory, both results should be the same. But because of floating-point rounding, the order can make a small difference. This is a great example of how numerical stability matters — especially in scientific computing.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"summing one over i squared, from i equals 1 to 10\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"two ways — forward, starting from i equals 1, or backward, starting from i equals 10\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<SLIDE_TEXT>\"},\n    {\"s\":\"the results should be the same\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"but because of floating-point rounding, the order can make a small difference\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<SLIDE_TEXT>\"},\n    {\"s\":\"numerical stability matters — especially in scientific computing\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<SLIDE_TEXT>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}",
