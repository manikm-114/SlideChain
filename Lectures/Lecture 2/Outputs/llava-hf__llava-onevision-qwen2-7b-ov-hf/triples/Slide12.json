Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSuppose we define:\u000bv as a row vector equals negative two, three, zero, four point five, and negative one point five.\u000bTo make it a column, we write: v equals v prime — using the transpose.\nTo access elements:\u000bv of one gives the first,\u000bv of two to four gives the second to fourth,\u000band v of three and five gives just those two.\nYou can also create sequences.\u000bFor example: v equals four to two, stepping by negative one — gives four, three, two.\nAnd combining vectors is easy.\u000bIf a equals one to three, and b equals two to three,\u000bthen c equals a b — gives one, two, three, two, three.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"v\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"v_prime\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"To make it a column, we write: v equals v_prime — using the transpose.\"}\n  ]\n}",
