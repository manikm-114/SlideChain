Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThe very first step is to install and activate MATLAB.\nIf you’re at RPI, you can download MATLAB directly from the campus software portal: dotcio.rpi.edu/services/software-labs. Make sure to follow the installation instructions that match your operating system — whether you're on Windows, macOS, or Linux.\nDuring the installation, you’ll be asked to enter a product key to activate the software. This key is provided by the institution, and it unlocks your licensed access.\nIf you run into any issues during the setup — like installation errors or activation trouble — don’t hesitate to reach out. You can consult the help center, or message me directly. We're here to help you get started smoothly.\nHaving MATLAB set up and ready prepares us well before diving into hands-on examples.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"MATLAB\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"RPI\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"If you’re at RPI, you can download MATLAB directly from the campus software portal: dotcio.rpi.edu/services/software-labs.\"}\n  ]\n}",
