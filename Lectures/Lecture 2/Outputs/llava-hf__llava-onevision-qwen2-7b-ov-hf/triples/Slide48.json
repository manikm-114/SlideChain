Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow we move into data science with the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox.\nThis toolbox helps you analyze data, test hypotheses, and build predictive models.\nYou can use it for clustering, regression, dimensionality reduction, or training classifiers. It also supports parallel computing, which is great for handling large datasets.\nAnd the best part? Many of these features work with just a few lines of code — so you can try powerful techniques without writing complex algorithms from scratch.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"data analysis, hypothesis testing, predictive models\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"This toolbox helps you analyze data, test hypotheses, and build predictive models.\"}\n  ]\n}",
