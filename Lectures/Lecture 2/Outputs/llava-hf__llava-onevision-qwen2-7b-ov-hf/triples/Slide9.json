Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAs you begin using MATLAB, you might occasionally wonder, “What does this function do?” That’s where the built-in help system comes in.\nLet’s say you want to understand how to create a plot. Just type help plot in the command window, and MATLAB will show you the syntax, arguments, and examples for that function.\nIf you don’t know the name of the function you need, use the lookfor command. For example, typing lookfor matrix will return a list of functions that relate to matrices.\nThese built-in tools are powerful and often overlooked. Knowing how to access documentation and search for functions will make you more independent and effective as you learn.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"help\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"plot\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"Just type help plot in the command window, and MATLAB will show you the syntax, arguments, and examples for that function.\"}\n  ]\n}",
