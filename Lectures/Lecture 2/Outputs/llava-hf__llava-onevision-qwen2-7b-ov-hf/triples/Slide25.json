Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s talk about reading and writing data files.\nTo open a file, use f open, and pass the file name and read mode.\u000bFor example: f open in dot dat, r t.\nThis gives you a file ID — or fid.\nUse f scanf to read numbers from the file.\u000bWhen you're done, always close the file using f close.\nIf you need formatting help, use help textread or help f printf.\nBelow is an example of a data file — it has names, types, numbers, and yes or no labels.\nYou’ll often need to work with mixed data — so learning how to read from and write to files is essential in MATLAB workflows.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"f open\", \"p\":\"uses\", \"o\":\"file\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"To open a file, use f open, and pass the file name and read mode.\"}\n  ]\n}",
