Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo far we’ve looked at reading files — now let’s switch to writing.\nTo write data out, open a file in write mode using fopen. Then use fprintf to format the output line, inserting variables in the order you want them saved.\nFor example, you can save name, type, and numerical values all in one line. And as always, once writing is done, make sure to close the file with fclose.\nThis gives you full control over the format, spacing, and layout of your data. Very useful when preparing results for review, or generating output for other software to read.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"fopen\", \"p\":\"uses\", \"o\":\"file\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"To write data out, open a file in write mode using fopen.\"}\n  ]\n}",
