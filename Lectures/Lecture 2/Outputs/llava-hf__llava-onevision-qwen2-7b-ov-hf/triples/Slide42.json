Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere’s how we do that in MATLAB.\nFirst, we compute the wavelength range using the start point, number of data points, and spacing. Then, we build a vector of wavelengths.\nNext, we plot the spectrum and locate the lowest point — which marks the Hydrogen-alpha line. Its position gives us the shifted wavelength.\nUsing the Doppler shift formula, we compute the redshift, then multiply by 300,000 — the speed of light in kilometers per second — to get the star’s velocity.\nJust a few lines of code, and we’re measuring motion across space.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"MATLAB\", \"p\":\"uses\", \"o\":\"wavelength range\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"First, we compute the wavelength range using the start point, number of data points, and spacing.\"}\n  ]\n}",
