Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s take a moment to look at some fundamental syntax in MATLAB that you’ll see all the time.\nThe percent symbol — % — is used for writing comments. Anything after that symbol is ignored by MATLAB, so it’s a great way to document your code. \nA semicolon — ; — tells MATLAB not to display the output of a command, which keeps your console cleaner.\nIf a command is getting too long, you can break it across multiple lines using three dots — .... This helps keep your code readable.\nMATLAB also includes a few important constants: eps stands for machine precision, inf is infinity, and NaN — which stands for “Not a Number” — appears when a calculation isn’t mathematically defined, like dividing some number by zero.\nTo control how numbers appear on your screen, use formatting commands. For example, format long shows more decimal places, and format short shows fewer.\nYou also have access to a large library of built-in functions — like sqrt for square roots, exp for exponentials, and trigonometric functions such as sin and cos.\nBasic arithmetic is intuitive — you’ll use plus, minus, times, and divide symbols just as you'd expect. And for constants, MATLAB gives you pi, and Euler’s number, which you can access with exp 1.\nTogether, these form the foundation of all numerical work in MATLAB.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"%\",\"p\":\"uses\",\"o\":\"denote a comment\",\"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"],\"confidence\":0.0,\"evidence\":\"SLIDE_TEXT\"}\n  ]\n}",
