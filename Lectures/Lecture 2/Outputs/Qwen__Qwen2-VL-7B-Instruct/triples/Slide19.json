Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s talk about how we make decisions in MATLAB.\n\nFirst, the if statement.\nYou might say:\u000b“If x is equal to 3, display: the value of x is 3.\u000bIf x is equal to 5, display: the value of x is 5.\u000bOtherwise, display: the value of x is not 3 or 5.”\nThis allows the program to choose what to do based on the value of x.\nNow, when you want to check one variable against several specific values, a switch statement is better.\n\nFor example:\u000b“If face is 1, say: rolled a one.\u000bIf face is 2, say: rolled a two.\u000bOtherwise, say: rolled a number greater than or equal to three.”\nThis is easier to read than writing multiple if statements. And in MATLAB, the switch ends automatically — no need for a break.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"if statement\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"decision-making in MATLAB\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}",
