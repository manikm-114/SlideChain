From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere’s how we morph faces using matrix tools.\nWe warp two face images using interpolation on each color channel. Then blend them using a weighted average — with alpha controlling the mix.\nTo detect unusual pixels, we reshape the image and compute the Mahalanobis distance from a reference color.\nNext, we create a binary mask by thresholding the distance, and apply a median filter to clean it up.\nIt’s a compact example of how MATLAB combines image warping, statistics, and filtering — all with matrices.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Reject filler or administrative text.\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"image morphing\", \"category\": \"algorithm\"},\n    {\"term\": \"interpolation\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"weighted average\", \"category\": \"algorithm\"},\n    {\"term\": \"Mahalanobis distance\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"binary mask\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"median filter\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"Here’s how we morph faces using matrix tools.\", \"We warp two face images using interpolation on each color channel.\", \"Then blend them using a weighted average — with alpha controlling the mix.\", \"To detect unusual pixels, we reshape the image and compute the Mahalanobis distance from a reference color.\", \"Next, we create a binary mask by thresholding the distance, and apply a median filter to clean it up.\"]\n}",
