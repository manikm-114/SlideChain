From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nIf you're unable to install MATLAB on your own machine, don’t worry — you still have options.\nOne solution is MATLAB Online, a browser-based version provided by MathWorks. You can access it from any modern browser without installing anything on your device. Just search “run MATLAB online,” and you’ll find the link right away.\nAnother option is Octave Online. It’s a free, open-source alternative that supports many MATLAB commands. While it doesn’t include all the advanced toolboxes, it’s good enough for our assignments.\nSo remember, lack of installation shouldn’t be a blocker preventing you from doing homework. There are various ways to stay engaged and complete your tasks — all you need is a browser and a willingness.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Reject filler or administrative text.\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"MATLAB Online\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"Octave Online\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"browser-based version\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"MathWorks\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"MATLAB commands\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"advanced toolboxes\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"browser\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"willingness\", \"category\": \"software\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\n    \"One solution is MATLAB Online, a browser-based version provided by MathWorks.\",\n    \"Another option is Octave Online.
