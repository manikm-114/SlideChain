From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nFinally, let’s talk about how to keep learning on your own.\nThere’s a helpful online tutorial by Dr. Azernikov that introduces MATLAB basics step by step. It’s clear and beginner-friendly — a great way to reinforce what we’ve learned here.\nAlso, don’t forget about MATLAB’s built-in help tools. If your cursor is on a command, just press F1. Or type help followed by the function name in the Command Window.\nFor more support, you can check the MathWorks website, Stack Overflow, or MATLAB Central. These are great places to ask questions and find real code examples.\nIn short — keep exploring, keep experimenting, and you'll keep getting better.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Reject filler or administrative text.\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"MATLAB\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"tutorial\", \"category\": \"tutorial\"},\n    {\"term\": \"help tools\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"F1\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"help\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"MathWorks\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"Stack Overflow\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"MATLAB Central\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"keep exploring\", \"category\": \"tutorial\"},\n    {\"term\": \"keep experimenting\", \"category\": \"tutorial\"},\n    {\"term\": \"keep getting better\", \"category\": \"tutorial\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\n    \"There’s a helpful online tutorial by Dr. Azernikov that introduces MATLAB basics step by step.
