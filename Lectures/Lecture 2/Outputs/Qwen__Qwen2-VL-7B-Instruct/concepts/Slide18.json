From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s talk about control flow — specifically, loops.\nStart with a for loop. Use it when you know how many times you want to repeat something.\nFor example:\u000bSet x to zero.\u000bThen, for i from 1 to 5 in steps of 2 — so, 1, 3, and 5 —\u000bwe add i to x.\u000bAt the end, x equals 9.\nfor loops are useful when working through a known sequence.\nNow, a while loop runs as long as a condition is true.\nIn this example:\u000bStart with x equal to 7.\u000bWhile x is greater than or equal to zero, subtract 2 each time.\u000bThe loop stops when x becomes negative.\nJust be careful — if the condition never becomes false, the loop won’t stop.\nFinally, break lets you exit a loop early.\u000bIt’s useful if you find what you need before the loop finishes.\u000bIn nested loops, it only exits the innermost one.\u000bUse it wisely — don’t skip steps that still matter.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Reject filler or administrative text.\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"for loops\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"while loops\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"break\", \"category\": \"software\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\n    \"for loops are useful when working through a known sequence.\",\n    \"while loops run as long as a condition is true.\",\n    \"break lets you exit a loop early.\"\n  ]\n}",
