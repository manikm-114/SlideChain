From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s talk about how we make decisions in MATLAB.\n\nFirst, the if statement.\nYou might say:\u000b“If x is equal to 3, display: the value of x is 3.\u000bIf x is equal to 5, display: the value of x is 5.\u000bOtherwise, display: the value of x is not 3 or 5.”\nThis allows the program to choose what to do based on the value of x.\nNow, when you want to check one variable against several specific values, a switch statement is better.\n\nFor example:\u000b“If face is 1, say: rolled a one.\u000bIf face is 2, say: rolled a two.\u000bOtherwise, say: rolled a number greater than or equal to three.”\nThis is easier to read than writing multiple if statements. And in MATLAB, the switch ends automatically — no need for a break.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Reject filler or administrative text.\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"if statement\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"switch statement\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"MATLAB\", \"category\": \"software\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"Let’s talk about how we make decisions in MATLAB.\", \"This allows the program to choose what to do based on the value of x.\", \"This is easier to read than writing multiple if statements.\"]\n}",
