From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s look at a real-world scientific task — measuring how stars move.\nWe start with spectral data from a star. It includes many wavelengths, evenly spaced. The key is to find a feature called the Hydrogen-alpha line. If that line shifts, the star is moving — either away or toward us.\nWith MATLAB, we’ll identify that line, calculate how much it’s shifted, and then use the Doppler formula to estimate the star’s speed.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
