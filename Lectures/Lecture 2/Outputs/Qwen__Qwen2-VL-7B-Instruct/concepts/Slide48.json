From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow we move into data science with the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox.\nThis toolbox helps you analyze data, test hypotheses, and build predictive models.\nYou can use it for clustering, regression, dimensionality reduction, or training classifiers. It also supports parallel computing, which is great for handling large datasets.\nAnd the best part? Many of these features work with just a few lines of code — so you can try powerful techniques without writing complex algorithms from scratch.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Reject filler or administrative text.\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"data analysis\", \"category\": \"data_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"hypothesis testing\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"regression\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"dimensionality reduction\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"clustering\", \"category\": \"algorithm\"},\n    {\"term\": \"parallel computing\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"large datasets\", \"category\": \"data_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"few lines of code\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"powerful techniques\", \"category\": \"algorithm\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\n    \"This toolbox helps you analyze data, test hypotheses, and build predictive models.\",\n    \"You can use it for clustering, regression, dimensionality reduction, or training classifiers.\",\n    \"It also supports parallel computing, which is great for handling large datasets.\",\n    \"And the best part?
