From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nWhenever you can, avoid loops — and write in matrix form.\nInstead of looping to square elements, just write “A dot caret 2”.\nWant row-wise sums? Use “sum of A, comma 2”.\nNeed probabilities per row? Divide each row by its total using matrix broadcasting — it’s cleaner and faster than nested loops.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Reject filler or administrative text.\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"avoid loops\", \"category\": \"algorithm\"},\n    {\"term\": \"write in matrix form\", \"category\": \"algorithm\"},\n    {\"term\": \"A dot caret 2\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"sum of A, comma 2\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"matrix broadcasting\", \"category\": \"algorithm\"},\n    {\"term\": \"cleaner and faster\", \"category\": \"algorithm\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\n    \"Whenever you can, avoid loops — and write in matrix form.\",\n    \"Instead of looping to square elements, just write “A dot caret 2”.\",\n    \"Want row-wise sums?
