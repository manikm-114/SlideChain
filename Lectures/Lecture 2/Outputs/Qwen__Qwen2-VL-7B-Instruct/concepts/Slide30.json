From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nOne of the key ideas in MATLAB is that everything is a matrix.\nA single number? That’s just a one-by-one matrix.\u000bA row of numbers is a row vector. A column is a column vector.\u000bAnd an image? That’s a two-dimensional matrix.\u000bIf it’s in color, it becomes three-dimensional — width, height, and color channels.\nThis matrix mindset makes MATLAB powerful and consistent across tasks — whether you're doing math, image processing, or even machine learning.\nNow, let’s talk about indexing. If you have a matrix A:\u000bA of i comma j gives the element in row i and column j.\u000bA of i comma colon gives the entire i-th row.\u000bA of colon comma j gives the whole j-th column.\nYou can reshape matrices, slice out parts, or use logical masks to filter data.\nTo modify the matrix, use expressions like A plus five — which adds five to every element.\u000bOr A dot star B — for element-by-element multiplication.\nThis is the foundation of MATLAB — matrix thinking in everything you do\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
