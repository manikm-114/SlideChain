From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s write our own matrix multiplication function — no built-in functions allowed.\nWe create a function called matrix_multiply that takes two square matrices and a size n.\nUsing three nested loops, we compute the product row by row and column by column. For each entry in the result, we take a dot product between a row of A and a column of B.\nThis hands-on approach shows exactly how matrix multiplication works under the hood — which is important to understand before we talk about optimization.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
