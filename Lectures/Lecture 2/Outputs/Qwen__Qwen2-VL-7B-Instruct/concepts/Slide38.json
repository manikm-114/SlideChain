From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s try a simple numerical task: summing one over i squared, from i equals 1 to 10.\nWe can do this two ways — forward, starting from i equals 1, or backward, starting from i equals 10.\nThe code is nearly identical, just with the loop going in reverse.\nNow, in theory, both results should be the same. But because of floating-point rounding, the order can make a small difference. This is a great example of how numerical stability matters — especially in scientific computing.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Reject filler or administrative text.\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"floating-point rounding\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"numerical stability\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"scientific computing\", \"category\": \"software\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"This is a great example of how numerical stability matters — especially in scientific computing.\"]\n}",
