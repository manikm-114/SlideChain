From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s talk about the two main types of files you’ll create in MATLAB — scripts and functions.\nScripts are simple. They run a series of commands and use variables already in your workspace. You don’t pass anything in, and they don’t return anything out. They’re great for quick experiments or automation.\nFunctions, on the other hand, are more structured. You give them inputs, and they return outputs. Inside a function, all variables are local — meaning they don’t interfere with anything else in your workspace.\nKnowing when to use a script or a function is key to writing clean, reliable code.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Reject filler or administrative text.\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"scripts\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"functions\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"input arguments\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"output arguments\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"workspace\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"local variables\", \"category\": \"software\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\n    \"Scripts, which do not accept input arguments or return output arguments.
