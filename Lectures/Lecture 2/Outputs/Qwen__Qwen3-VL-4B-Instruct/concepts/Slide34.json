From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere’s how we morph faces using matrix tools.\nWe warp two face images using interpolation on each color channel. Then blend them using a weighted average — with alpha controlling the mix.\nTo detect unusual pixels, we reshape the image and compute the Mahalanobis distance from a reference color.\nNext, we create a binary mask by thresholding the distance, and apply a median filter to clean it up.\nIt’s a compact example of how MATLAB combines image warping, statistics, and filtering — all with matrices.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
