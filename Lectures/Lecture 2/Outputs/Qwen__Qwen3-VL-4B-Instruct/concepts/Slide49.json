From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThe Symbolic Math Toolbox brings exact math into MATLAB.\nInstead of working with numbers alone, you can define symbolic variables and compute exact derivatives, integrals, or solutions to equations.\nFor example, you can write a function like f of x equals x squared times sine x and ask MATLAB to find its derivative. You’ll get the answer in symbolic form — not an approximation.\nYou can also plot these expressions or export them into Simulink for simulation.\nIt’s a great toolbox for exploring math symbolically, especially in calculus and algebra-heavy problems.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Reject filler or administrative text.\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\n      \"term\": \"The Symbolic Math Toolbox brings exact math into MATLAB.\",\n      \"category\": \"software\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"Instead of working with numbers alone, you can define symbolic variables and compute exact derivatives, integrals, or solutions to equations.\",\n      \"category\": \"mathematics\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"For example, you can write a function like f of x equals x squared times sine x and ask MATLAB to find its derivative.\",\n      \"category\": \"mathematics\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"You’ll get the answer in symbolic form — not an approximation.\",\n      \"category\": \"mathematics\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"You can also plot these expressions or export them into Simulink for simulation.\",\n      \"category\": \"workflow\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"It’s a great toolbox for exploring math symbolically, especially in calculus and algebra-heavy problems.\",\n      \"category\": \"mathematics\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\n    \"The Symbolic Math Toolbox brings exact math into MATLAB.\",\n    \"Instead of working with numbers alone, you can define symbolic variables and compute exact derivatives",
