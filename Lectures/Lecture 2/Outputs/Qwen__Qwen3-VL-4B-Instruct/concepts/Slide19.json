From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s talk about how we make decisions in MATLAB.\n\nFirst, the if statement.\nYou might say:\u000b“If x is equal to 3, display: the value of x is 3.\u000bIf x is equal to 5, display: the value of x is 5.\u000bOtherwise, display: the value of x is not 3 or 5.”\nThis allows the program to choose what to do based on the value of x.\nNow, when you want to check one variable against several specific values, a switch statement is better.\n\nFor example:\u000b“If face is 1, say: rolled a one.\u000bIf face is 2, say: rolled a two.\u000bOtherwise, say: rolled a number greater than or equal to three.”\nThis is easier to read than writing multiple if statements. And in MATLAB, the switch ends automatically — no need for a break.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Reject filler or administrative text.\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\n      \"term\": \"if statement\",\n      \"category\": \"software\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"switch statement\",\n      \"category\": \"software\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"If x is equal to 3, display: the value of x is 3.\",\n      \"category\": \"software\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"If x is equal to 5, display: the value of x is 5.\",\n      \"category\": \"software\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"Otherwise, display: the value of x is not 3 or 5.\",\n      \"category\": \"software\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"If face is 1, say: rolled a one.\",\n      \"category\": \"software\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"If face is 2, say: rolled a two.\",\n      \"category\": \"software\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"Otherwise, say: rolled a number greater than or equal to three.\",\n      \"category\": \"software\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"This allows the program to choose what to do based on the value of x.\",\n      \"",
