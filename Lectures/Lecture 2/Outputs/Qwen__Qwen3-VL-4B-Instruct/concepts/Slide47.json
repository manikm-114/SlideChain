From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNext up — the Optimization Toolbox.\nThis one’s all about solving problems where you want to find the best outcome — like minimizing cost, or maximizing performance.\nYou can solve linear programs, quadratic programs, and nonlinear problems. It also supports multi-objective optimization.\nIt’s useful in many fields — from data fitting and machine learning to operations research. If your work involves tuning models or decision-making, this toolbox is essential.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Reject filler or administrative text.\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\n      \"term\": \"solving problems where you want to find the best outcome\",\n      \"category\": \"algorithm\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"minimizing cost\",\n      \"category\": \"algorithm\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"maximizing performance\",\n      \"category\": \"algorithm\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"solve linear programs\",\n      \"category\": \"algorithm\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"quadratic programs\",\n      \"category\": \"algorithm\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"nonlinear problems\",\n      \"category\": \"algorithm\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"multi-objective optimization\",\n      \"category\": \"algorithm\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"data fitting\",\n      \"category\": \"data_processing\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"machine learning\",\n      \"category\": \"ai_ml\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"operations research\",\n      \"category\": \"algorithm\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"tuning models\",\n      \"category\": \"algorithm\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"decision-making\",\n      \"category\": \"algorithm\"\n    }",
