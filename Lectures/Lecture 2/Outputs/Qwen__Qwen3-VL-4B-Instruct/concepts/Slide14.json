From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nMATLAB also makes it easy to generate special-purpose matrices, which are often useful for setting up or testing algorithms.\nFor example, diag of v creates a diagonal matrix from a vector. You can also reverse it: diag of A pulls the diagonal elements from a matrix.\nIf you need an identity matrix — that’s a square matrix with ones on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere — just write eye of n.\nTo create a matrix full of zeros, use zeros of m and n. If you need one filled with ones, use ones of m and n.\nThese kinds of matrices are especially useful when initializing arrays before filling them with computed values.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Reject filler or administrative text.\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\n      \"term\": \"diag of v creates a diagonal matrix from a vector\",\n      \"category\": \"mathematics\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"diag of A pulls the diagonal elements from a matrix\",\n      \"category\": \"mathematics\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"eye of n\",\n      \"category\": \"mathematics\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"zeros of m and n\",\n      \"category\": \"mathematics\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"ones of m and n\",\n      \"category\": \"mathematics\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"These kinds of matrices are especially useful when initializing arrays before filling them with computed values\",\n      \"category\": \"algorithm\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\n    \"MATLAB also makes it easy to generate special-purpose matrices, which are often useful for setting up or testing algorithms.\",\n    \"For example, diag of v creates a diagonal matrix from a vector.\",\n    \"You can also reverse it: diag of A pulls the diagonal elements from a matrix.\",\n    \"If you need an identity matrix — that’s a square matrix with ones on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere — just write",
