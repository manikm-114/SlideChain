From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s explore the Image Processing Toolbox.\nIt includes powerful tools for loading, modifying, analyzing, and segmenting images.\nYou can sharpen edges, enhance contrast, or isolate bright regions. It even lets you analyze object shapes and intensities — which is essential in fields like medical imaging.\nYou can also use it to register images, align features, and prepare large datasets for analysis. And if needed, you can even accelerate the workflow with C or C++ code.\nThis toolbox makes MATLAB a great platform for both learning and real-world applications in imaging.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Reject filler or administrative text.\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\n      \"term\": \"loading, modifying, analyzing, and segmenting images\",\n      \"category\": \"data_processing\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"sharpen edges\",\n      \"category\": \"signal_processing\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"enhance contrast\",\n      \"category\": \"signal_processing\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"isolate bright regions\",\n      \"category\": \"signal_processing\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"analyze object shapes and intensities\",\n      \"category\": \"data_processing\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"register images\",\n      \"category\": \"workflow\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"align features\",\n      \"category\": \"workflow\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"prepare large datasets for analysis\",\n      \"category\": \"workflow\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"accelerate the workflow with C or C++ code\",\n      \"category\": \"workflow\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"makes MATLAB a great platform for both learning and real-world applications in imaging\",\n      \"category\": \"software\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\n    \"It includes powerful tools",
