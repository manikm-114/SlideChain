From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nTo test our new function, we write a quick script.\nWe choose a matrix size n, generate two random n-by-n matrices A and B, and call our matrix_multiply function to compute the result.\nYou can also compare it to MATLAB’s built-in multiplication to check for accuracy.\nAnd here’s something to think about — this triple-loop method works, but it’s not fast. Later on, we’ll talk about how to rewrite this using vectorized operations to make it much more efficient.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Reject filler or administrative text.\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\n      \"term\": \"To test our new function, we write a quick script.\",\n      \"category\": \"workflow\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"We choose a matrix size n, generate two random n-by-n matrices A and B, and call our matrix_multiply function to compute the result.\",\n      \"category\": \"algorithm\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"You can also compare it to MATLAB’s built-in multiplication to check for accuracy.\",\n      \"category\": \"data_processing\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"this triple-loop method works, but it’s not fast.\",\n      \"category\": \"algorithm\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"Later on, we’ll talk about how to rewrite this using vectorized operations to make it much more efficient.\",\n      \"category\": \"algorithm\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\n    \"To test our new function, we write a quick script.\",\n    \"We choose a matrix size n, generate two random n-by-n matrices A and B, and call our matrix_multiply function to compute the result.\",\n    \"You can also compare it to MATLAB’s built-in multiplication to check for accuracy.\",\n    \"this triple-loop method",
