From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s talk about reading and writing data files.\nTo open a file, use f open, and pass the file name and read mode.\u000bFor example: f open in dot dat, r t.\nThis gives you a file ID — or fid.\nUse f scanf to read numbers from the file.\u000bWhen you're done, always close the file using f close.\nIf you need formatting help, use help textread or help f printf.\nBelow is an example of a data file — it has names, types, numbers, and yes or no labels.\nYou’ll often need to work with mixed data — so learning how to read from and write to files is essential in MATLAB workflows.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
