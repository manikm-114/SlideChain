From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere’s how we do that in MATLAB.\nFirst, we compute the wavelength range using the start point, number of data points, and spacing. Then, we build a vector of wavelengths.\nNext, we plot the spectrum and locate the lowest point — which marks the Hydrogen-alpha line. Its position gives us the shifted wavelength.\nUsing the Doppler shift formula, we compute the redshift, then multiply by 300,000 — the speed of light in kilometers per second — to get the star’s velocity.\nJust a few lines of code, and we’re measuring motion across space.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
