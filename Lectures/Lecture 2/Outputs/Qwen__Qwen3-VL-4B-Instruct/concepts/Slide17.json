From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow that we’ve seen how to work with equations, let’s take a moment to explore how we can inspect the structure of the data we’re working with — vectors and matrices.\nTo find out how long a vector is, just use length — so length of v tells you how many elements it has.\nIf you’re working with a matrix, and you want to know its shape — how many rows and columns — just use size of A.\nWant to check if a matrix is full rank? That’s easy — rank of A will do the job.\nAnd when we want to understand how large a matrix or vector is in terms of magnitude, we use the norm function. Just norm of A gives the 2-norm by default — that’s the square root of the sum of squares. You can also ask for specific norms like the 1-norm using norm of A, one, or the infinity norm with norm of A, inf.\nThese commands give you insight into the structure and stability of your data — and they’re especially useful when you’re preparing data for algorithms or interpreting results.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
