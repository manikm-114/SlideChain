From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo far we’ve looked at reading files — now let’s switch to writing.\nTo write data out, open a file in write mode using fopen. Then use fprintf to format the output line, inserting variables in the order you want them saved.\nFor example, you can save name, type, and numerical values all in one line. And as always, once writing is done, make sure to close the file with fclose.\nThis gives you full control over the format, spacing, and layout of your data. Very useful when preparing results for review, or generating output for other software to read.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Reject filler or administrative text.\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\n      \"term\": \"open a file in write mode using fopen\",\n      \"category\": \"software\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"use fprintf to format the output line\",\n      \"category\": \"software\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"insert variables in the order you want them saved\",\n      \"category\": \"software\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"once writing is done, make sure to close the file with fclose\",\n      \"category\": \"software\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"full control over the format, spacing, and layout of your data\",\n      \"category\": \"data_processing\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"very useful when preparing results for review, or generating output for other software to read\",\n      \"category\": \"data_processing\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\n    \"To write data out, open a file in write mode using fopen.
