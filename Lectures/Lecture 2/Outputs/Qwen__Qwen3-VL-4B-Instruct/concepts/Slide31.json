From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nIn MATLAB, you can do both matrix and element-wise operations — and the difference is all in the dot.\n“A times B” — with a single star — means matrix multiplication.\u000b“A dot star B” — with a dot — means multiply element by element.\nSame goes for powers and division.\u000b“A caret 2” raises the matrix to a power.\u000b“A dot caret 2” squares each element.\u000bAnd for division, “A divided by B” solves equations, while “A dot slash B” divides element-wise.\nThese small differences are key when working with data, equations, or signals in MATLAB.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
