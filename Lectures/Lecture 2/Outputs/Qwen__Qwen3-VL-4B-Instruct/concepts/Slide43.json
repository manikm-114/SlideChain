From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s switch gears to 3D graphics.\nHere, we’re creating a cone using MATLAB’s cylinder function.\nWe define a shape with the vector: t equals zero, one, zero. This gives us a cone shape.\nThen we call the cylinder function to get the X, Y, and Z coordinates, and use surf to draw the 3D surface.\nThis shows how easily you can build and visualize 3D shapes in MATLAB — helpful for both learning and engineering.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
