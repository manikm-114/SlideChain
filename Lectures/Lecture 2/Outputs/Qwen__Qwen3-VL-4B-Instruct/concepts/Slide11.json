From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s take a moment to look at some fundamental syntax in MATLAB that you’ll see all the time.\nThe percent symbol — % — is used for writing comments. Anything after that symbol is ignored by MATLAB, so it’s a great way to document your code. \nA semicolon — ; — tells MATLAB not to display the output of a command, which keeps your console cleaner.\nIf a command is getting too long, you can break it across multiple lines using three dots — .... This helps keep your code readable.\nMATLAB also includes a few important constants: eps stands for machine precision, inf is infinity, and NaN — which stands for “Not a Number” — appears when a calculation isn’t mathematically defined, like dividing some number by zero.\nTo control how numbers appear on your screen, use formatting commands. For example, format long shows more decimal places, and format short shows fewer.\nYou also have access to a large library of built-in functions — like sqrt for square roots, exp for exponentials, and trigonometric functions such as sin and cos.\nBasic arithmetic is intuitive — you’ll use plus, minus, times, and divide symbols just as you'd expect. And for constants, MATLAB gives you pi, and Euler’s number, which you can access with exp 1.\nTogether, these form the foundation of all numerical work in MATLAB.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Reject filler or administrative text.\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\n      \"term\": \"%\",\n      \"category\": \"software\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \";\",\n      \"category\": \"software\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"....\",\n      \"category\": \"software\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"eps\",\n      \"category\": \"software\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"inf\",\n      \"category\": \"software\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"NaN\",\n      \"category\": \"software\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"format long\",\n      \"category\": \"software\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"format short\",\n      \"category\": \"software\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"sqrt(x)\",\n      \"category\": \"mathematics\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"exp(x)\",\n      \"category\": \"mathematics\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"cos(x)\",\n      \"category\": \"mathematics\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"sin(x)\",\n      \"category\": \"mathematics\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"sum(x)\",\n      \"category\": \"mathematics\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term",
