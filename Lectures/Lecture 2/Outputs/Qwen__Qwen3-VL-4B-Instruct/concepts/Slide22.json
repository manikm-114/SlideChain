From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSometimes, you want to show several plots in one window.\nUse the subplot command to divide the figure into a grid.\u000bFor example, subplot 2, 3, 1 creates two rows and three columns — and selects the first cell.\nEach subplot acts like an independent plot. You can add titles, labels, and style just like a regular figure.\nThis is helpful when comparing outputs or organizing results cleanly on a single screen.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Reject filler or administrative text.\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\n      \"term\": \"subplot command\",\n      \"category\": \"software\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"divide the figure into a grid\",\n      \"category\": \"software\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"subplot 2, 3, 1 creates two rows and three columns — and selects the first cell\",\n      \"category\": \"software\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"Each subplot acts like an independent plot\",\n      \"category\": \"software\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"You can add titles, labels, and style just like a regular figure\",\n      \"category\": \"software\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"This is helpful when comparing outputs or organizing results cleanly on a single screen\",\n      \"category\": \"workflow\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\n    \"Sometimes, you want to show several plots in one window.\",\n    \"Use the subplot command to divide the figure into a grid.\",\n    \"For example, subplot 2, 3, 1 creates two rows and three columns — and selects the first cell.\",\n    \"Each subplot acts like an independent plot.\",\n    \"You can add titles, labels, and",
