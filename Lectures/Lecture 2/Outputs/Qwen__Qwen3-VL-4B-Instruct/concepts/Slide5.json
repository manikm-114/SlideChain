From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s take a closer look at Octave.\nOctave is a scientific programming language that mirrors MATLAB’s syntax and functionality. It’s free, open-source, and available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. You can run it in the browser using Octave Online.\nThe interface looks different, but under the hood, many of the same commands will work — especially those used for basic matrix operations, plotting, and simple scripts. This makes Octave a reliable backup if MATLAB access is delayed or limited.\nWhile it might not support all specialized toolboxes or image processing features, it’s more than enough for getting started and building foundational skills, at least for this course.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Reject filler or administrative text.\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\n      \"term\": \"scientific programming language\",\n      \"category\": \"software\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"mirrors MATLAB’s syntax and functionality\",\n      \"category\": \"software\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"free, open-source\",\n      \"category\": \"software\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"available for Windows, macOS, and Linux\",\n      \"category\": \"software\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"run it in the browser using Octave Online\",\n      \"category\": \"software\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"many of the same commands will work\",\n      \"category\": \"software\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"basic matrix operations\",\n      \"category\": \"mathematics\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"plotting\",\n      \"category\": \"data_processing\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"simple scripts\",\n      \"category\": \"data_processing\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"more than enough for getting started\",\n      \"category\": \"data_processing\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"building foundational skills\",\n      \"category\": \"data_processing\"\n    }\n  ],",
