From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nWhenever you can, avoid loops — and write in matrix form.\nInstead of looping to square elements, just write “A dot caret 2”.\nWant row-wise sums? Use “sum of A, comma 2”.\nNeed probabilities per row? Divide each row by its total using matrix broadcasting — it’s cleaner and faster than nested loops.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
