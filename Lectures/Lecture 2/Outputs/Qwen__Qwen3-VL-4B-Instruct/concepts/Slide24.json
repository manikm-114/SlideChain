From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere are a few examples of what you can do with MATLAB plots.\nYou’ll see grouped bar charts, stacked bars, 2D lines, and 3D surfaces — all using basic commands.\nTry different styles, colors, and layouts to get the look you want.\nGood visualization tells a story — not just numbers, but patterns, relationships, and insights.\nUse plots not just to check results, but to communicate them clearly.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
