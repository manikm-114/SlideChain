Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s take a look at the Instrument Control Toolbox.\nThis toolbox allows MATLAB to talk directly to hardware — like oscilloscopes, sensors, or signal generators. That means you can send commands, receive data, and even control external devices — all from your MATLAB environment.\nYou can also create your own instrument drivers, manage device sessions, and work with supported protocols like VISA or TCP/IP.\nSo, if you're working in a lab with physical instruments, this toolbox helps you connect MATLAB to the real world.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"s\": \"Instrument Control Toolbox\",\n      \"p\": \"uses\",\n      \"o\": \"hardware\",\n      \"modalities\": [\"text\"],\n      \"confidence\": 0.9,\n      \"evidence\": \"This toolbox allows MATLAB to talk directly to hardware — like oscilloscopes, sensors, or signal generators.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"s\": \"Instrument Control Toolbox\",\n      \"p\": \"produces\",\n      \"o\": \"commands\",\n      \"modalities\": [\"text\"],\n      \"confidence\": 0.8,\n      \"evidence\": \"That means you can send commands, receive data, and even control external devices — all from your MATLAB environment.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"s\": \"Instrument Control Toolbox\",\n      \"p\": \"depends_on\",\n      \"o\": \"supported protocols like VISA or TCP/IP\",\n      \"modalities\": [\"text\"],\n      \"confidence\": 0.8,\n      \"evidence\": \"You can also create your own instrument drivers, manage device sessions, and work with supported protocols like VISA or TCP/IP.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"s\": \"Instrument Control Toolbox\",\n      \"p\": \"represents\",\n      \"",
