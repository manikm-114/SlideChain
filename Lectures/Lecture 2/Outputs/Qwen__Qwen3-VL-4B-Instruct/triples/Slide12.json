Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSuppose we define:\u000bv as a row vector equals negative two, three, zero, four point five, and negative one point five.\u000bTo make it a column, we write: v equals v prime — using the transpose.\nTo access elements:\u000bv of one gives the first,\u000bv of two to four gives the second to fourth,\u000band v of three and five gives just those two.\nYou can also create sequences.\u000bFor example: v equals four to two, stepping by negative one — gives four, three, two.\nAnd combining vectors is easy.\u000bIf a equals one to three, and b equals two to three,\u000bthen c equals a b — gives one, two, three, two, three.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
