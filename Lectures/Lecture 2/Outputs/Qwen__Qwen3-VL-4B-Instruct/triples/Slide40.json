Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nTo test our new function, we write a quick script.\nWe choose a matrix size n, generate two random n-by-n matrices A and B, and call our matrix_multiply function to compute the result.\nYou can also compare it to MATLAB’s built-in multiplication to check for accuracy.\nAnd here’s something to think about — this triple-loop method works, but it’s not fast. Later on, we’ll talk about how to rewrite this using vectorized operations to make it much more efficient.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": []\n}",
