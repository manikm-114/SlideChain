Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nOne of the key ideas in MATLAB is that everything is a matrix.\nA single number? That’s just a one-by-one matrix.\u000bA row of numbers is a row vector. A column is a column vector.\u000bAnd an image? That’s a two-dimensional matrix.\u000bIf it’s in color, it becomes three-dimensional — width, height, and color channels.\nThis matrix mindset makes MATLAB powerful and consistent across tasks — whether you're doing math, image processing, or even machine learning.\nNow, let’s talk about indexing. If you have a matrix A:\u000bA of i comma j gives the element in row i and column j.\u000bA of i comma colon gives the entire i-th row.\u000bA of colon comma j gives the whole j-th column.\nYou can reshape matrices, slice out parts, or use logical masks to filter data.\nTo modify the matrix, use expressions like A plus five — which adds five to every element.\u000bOr A dot star B — for element-by-element multiplication.\nThis is the foundation of MATLAB — matrix thinking in everything you do\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": []\n}",
