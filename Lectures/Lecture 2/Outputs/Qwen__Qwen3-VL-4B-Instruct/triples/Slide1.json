Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nWelcome to this session, where we’ll begin exploring MATLAB — one of the most widely used computational platforms in science and engineering, especially in biomedical imaging.\nThis will serve as your gateway to MATLAB: how it works, why we use it, and how it helps us handle real-world data. You don’t need any prior experience — we’ll start with the basics and build up step by step.\nAs we move forward, you’ll use MATLAB to generate signals, reconstruct images, and analyze datasets — all key tasks in medical imaging. The goal is not just to learn syntax, but to develop intuition and confidence in working with computational tools that are directly relevant to biomedical research and clinical practice.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"s\": \"MATLAB\",\n      \"p\": \"uses\",\n      \"o\": \"real-world data\",\n      \"modalities\": [\"text\"],\n      \"confidence\": 0.9,\n      \"evidence\": \"You’ll use MATLAB to generate signals, reconstruct images, and analyze datasets — all key tasks in medical imaging.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"s\": \"MATLAB\",\n      \"p\": \"reconstructs_with\",\n      \"o\": \"images\",\n      \"modalities\": [\"text\"],\n      \"confidence\": 0.9,\n      \"evidence\": \"You’ll use MATLAB to generate signals, reconstruct images, and analyze datasets — all key tasks in medical imaging.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
