Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s write our own matrix multiplication function — no built-in functions allowed.\nWe create a function called matrix_multiply that takes two square matrices and a size n.\nUsing three nested loops, we compute the product row by row and column by column. For each entry in the result, we take a dot product between a row of A and a column of B.\nThis hands-on approach shows exactly how matrix multiplication works under the hood — which is important to understand before we talk about optimization.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"s\": \"matrix_multiply\",\n      \"p\": \"uses\",\n      \"o\": \"three nested loops\",\n      \"modalities\": [\n        \"text\"\n      ],\n      \"confidence\": 0.9,\n      \"evidence\": \"We create a function called matrix_multiply that takes two square matrices and a size n.
