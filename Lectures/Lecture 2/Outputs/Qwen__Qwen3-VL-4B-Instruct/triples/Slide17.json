Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow that we’ve seen how to work with equations, let’s take a moment to explore how we can inspect the structure of the data we’re working with — vectors and matrices.\nTo find out how long a vector is, just use length — so length of v tells you how many elements it has.\nIf you’re working with a matrix, and you want to know its shape — how many rows and columns — just use size of A.\nWant to check if a matrix is full rank? That’s easy — rank of A will do the job.\nAnd when we want to understand how large a matrix or vector is in terms of magnitude, we use the norm function. Just norm of A gives the 2-norm by default — that’s the square root of the sum of squares. You can also ask for specific norms like the 1-norm using norm of A, one, or the infinity norm with norm of A, inf.\nThese commands give you insight into the structure and stability of your data — and they’re especially useful when you’re preparing data for algorithms or interpreting results.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"s\": \"length(v)\",\n      \"p\": \"measures\",\n      \"o\": \"length of vector.\",\n      \"modalities\": [\n        \"text\",\n        \"image\"\n      ],\n      \"confidence\": 0.98,\n      \"evidence\": \"length(v) % determine length of vector.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"s\": \"size(A)\",\n      \"p\": \"measures\",\n      \"o\": \"size of matrix.\",\n      \"modalities\": [\n        \"text\",\n        \"image\"\n      ],\n      \"confidence\": 0.98,\n      \"evidence\": \"size(A) % determine size of matrix.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"s\": \"rank(A)\",\n      \"p\": \"measures\",\n      \"o\": \"rank of matrix.\",\n      \"modalities\": [\n        \"text\",\n        \"image\"\n      ],\n      \"confidence\": 0.98,\n      \"evidence\": \"rank(A) % determine rank of matrix.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"s\": \"norm(A)\",\n      \"p\": \"produces\",\n      \"o\": \"2-norm of A.\",\n      \"modalities\": [\n        \"text\",",
