Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nIf you're unable to install MATLAB on your own machine, don’t worry — you still have options.\nOne solution is MATLAB Online, a browser-based version provided by MathWorks. You can access it from any modern browser without installing anything on your device. Just search “run MATLAB online,” and you’ll find the link right away.\nAnother option is Octave Online. It’s a free, open-source alternative that supports many MATLAB commands. While it doesn’t include all the advanced toolboxes, it’s good enough for our assignments.\nSo remember, lack of installation shouldn’t be a blocker preventing you from doing homework. There are various ways to stay engaged and complete your tasks — all you need is a browser and a willingness.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"s\": \"MATLAB Online\",\n      \"p\": \"uses\",\n      \"o\": \"browser\",\n      \"modalities\": [\"text\"],\n      \"confidence\": 0.9,\n      \"evidence\": \"You can access it from any modern browser without installing anything on your device.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"s\": \"Octave Online\",\n      \"p\": \"uses\",\n      \"o\": \"browser\",\n      \"modalities\": [\"text\"],\n      \"confidence\": 0.9,\n      \"evidence\": \"Free and easy computational engine in your browser.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"s\": \"MATLAB Online\",\n      \"p\": \"represents\",\n      \"o\": \"MathWorks\",\n      \"modalities\": [\"text\"],\n      \"confidence\": 0.8,\n      \"evidence\": \"MATLAB Online - MATLAB & Simulink - MathWorks\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"s\": \"Octave Online\",\n      \"p\": \"represents\",\n      \"o\": \"GNU Octave\",\n      \"modalities\": [\"text\"],\n      \"confidence\": 0.8,\n      \"evidence\": \"Powered by GNU Octave.\"\n    }",
