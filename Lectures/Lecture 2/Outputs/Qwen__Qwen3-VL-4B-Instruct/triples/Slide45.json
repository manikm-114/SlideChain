Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s explore the Image Processing Toolbox.\nIt includes powerful tools for loading, modifying, analyzing, and segmenting images.\nYou can sharpen edges, enhance contrast, or isolate bright regions. It even lets you analyze object shapes and intensities — which is essential in fields like medical imaging.\nYou can also use it to register images, align features, and prepare large datasets for analysis. And if needed, you can even accelerate the workflow with C or C++ code.\nThis toolbox makes MATLAB a great platform for both learning and real-world applications in imaging.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"s\": \"Image Processing Toolbox\",\n      \"p\": \"uses\",\n      \"o\": \"loading, modifying, analyzing, and segmenting images\",\n      \"modalities\": [\n        \"text\"\n      ],\n      \"confidence\": 0.9,\n      \"evidence\": \"It includes powerful tools for loading, modifying, analyzing, and segmenting images.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"s\": \"Image Processing Toolbox\",\n      \"p\": \"uses\",\n      \"o\": \"sharpening edges, enhancing contrast, or isolating bright regions\",\n      \"modalities\": [\n        \"text\"\n      ],\n      \"confidence\": 0.9,\n      \"evidence\": \"You can sharpen edges, enhance contrast, or isolate bright regions.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"s\": \"Image Processing Toolbox\",\n      \"p\": \"measures\",\n      \"o\": \"object shapes and intensities\",\n      \"modalities\": [\n        \"text\"\n      ],\n      \"confidence\": 0.9,\n      \"evidence\": \"It even lets you analyze object shapes and intensities — which is essential in fields like medical imaging.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"s\": \"Image Processing Toolbox\",",
