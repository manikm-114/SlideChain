Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nIn MATLAB, you can do both matrix and element-wise operations — and the difference is all in the dot.\n“A times B” — with a single star — means matrix multiplication.\u000b“A dot star B” — with a dot — means multiply element by element.\nSame goes for powers and division.\u000b“A caret 2” raises the matrix to a power.\u000b“A dot caret 2” squares each element.\u000bAnd for division, “A divided by B” solves equations, while “A dot slash B” divides element-wise.\nThese small differences are key when working with data, equations, or signals in MATLAB.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": []\n}",
