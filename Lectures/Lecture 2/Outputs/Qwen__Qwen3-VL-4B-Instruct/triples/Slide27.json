Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSometimes you don’t need the full file — you just want a specific line. Maybe line two contains Joe’s entry, and that’s all you care about.\nIn this case, you can tell MATLAB to skip one line, and then read just one. You still use textread, but now with two extra options: the number of lines to read, and the number of header lines to skip.\nThis lets you directly target a record without loading everything — useful for indexed data, or when you’re debugging or sampling from a large file.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"s\": \"textread\",\n      \"p\": \"uses\",\n      \"o\": \"two extra options\",\n      \"modalities\": [\n        \"text\"\n      ],\n      \"confidence\": 0.9,\n      \"evidence\": \"You still use textread, but now with two extra options: the number of lines to read, and the number of header lines to skip.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"s\": \"textread\",\n      \"p\": \"produces\",\n      \"o\": \"[name,type,x,y,answer]\",\n      \"modalities\": [\n        \"text\"\n      ],\n      \"confidence\": 0.9,\n      \"evidence\": \"[name,type,x,y,answer] = textread(fid,'%s%s%f%d%s',1,'headerlines',1);\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"s\": \"textread\",\n      \"p\": \"represents\",\n      \"o\": \"Joe’s entry\",\n      \"modalities\": [\n        \"text\"\n      ],\n      \"confidence\": 0.8,\n      \"evidence\": \"% Read-in one line of data corresponding % to Joe’s entry.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
