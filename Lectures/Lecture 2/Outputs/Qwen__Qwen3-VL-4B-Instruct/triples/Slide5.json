Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s take a closer look at Octave.\nOctave is a scientific programming language that mirrors MATLAB’s syntax and functionality. It’s free, open-source, and available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. You can run it in the browser using Octave Online.\nThe interface looks different, but under the hood, many of the same commands will work — especially those used for basic matrix operations, plotting, and simple scripts. This makes Octave a reliable backup if MATLAB access is delayed or limited.\nWhile it might not support all specialized toolboxes or image processing features, it’s more than enough for getting started and building foundational skills, at least for this course.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": []\n}",
