Here’s a basic function example — one that calculates the area and circumference of a circle.
We define a function called circle that takes one input: the radius. Inside, we calculate the area as pi times radius squared, and the circumference as two times pi times the radius.
Save this in a file named circle dot m.
Now, to use this function, we write a script. For example, if the radius is 7, we call the function with that value and display the result using disp.
You’d save this script as myscript dot m.
This is how functions and scripts work together. You build reusable tools with functions and run them from scripts.
