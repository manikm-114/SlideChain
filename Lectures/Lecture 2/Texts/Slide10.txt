Once you start writing code in MATLAB, you’ll be creating and manipulating variables — and the workspace is used to hold them.
The who and whos commands show you what variables are currently stored. who gives you a simple list, while whos gives more detail — like size, type, and memory usage.
You can save all your current variables to a file using the save command and later bring them back with load. If you want to start fresh, clear all wipes out everything in the workspace, clc clears the command window, and close all shuts any open figures.
These are simple but essential tools. Once you know how to manage your workspace, you’ll find MATLAB easier and more enjoyable to use.
