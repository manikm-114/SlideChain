Now let’s take a look at the Instrument Control Toolbox.
This toolbox allows MATLAB to talk directly to hardware — like oscilloscopes, sensors, or signal generators. That means you can send commands, receive data, and even control external devices — all from your MATLAB environment.
You can also create your own instrument drivers, manage device sessions, and work with supported protocols like VISA or TCP/IP.
So, if you're working in a lab with physical instruments, this toolbox helps you connect MATLAB to the real world.
