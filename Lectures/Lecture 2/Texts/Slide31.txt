In MATLAB, you can do both matrix and element-wise operations — and the difference is all in the dot.
“A times B” — with a single star — means matrix multiplication.“A dot star B” — with a dot — means multiply element by element.
Same goes for powers and division.“A caret 2” raises the matrix to a power.“A dot caret 2” squares each element.And for division, “A divided by B” solves equations, while “A dot slash B” divides element-wise.
These small differences are key when working with data, equations, or signals in MATLAB.
