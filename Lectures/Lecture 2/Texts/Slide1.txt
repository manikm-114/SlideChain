Welcome to this session, where we’ll begin exploring MATLAB — one of the most widely used computational platforms in science and engineering, especially in biomedical imaging.
This will serve as your gateway to MATLAB: how it works, why we use it, and how it helps us handle real-world data. You don’t need any prior experience — we’ll start with the basics and build up step by step.
As we move forward, you’ll use MATLAB to generate signals, reconstruct images, and analyze datasets — all key tasks in medical imaging. The goal is not just to learn syntax, but to develop intuition and confidence in working with computational tools that are directly relevant to biomedical research and clinical practice.
