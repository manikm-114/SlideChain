Now let’s look at a real-world scientific task — measuring how stars move.
We start with spectral data from a star. It includes many wavelengths, evenly spaced. The key is to find a feature called the Hydrogen-alpha line. If that line shifts, the star is moving — either away or toward us.
With MATLAB, we’ll identify that line, calculate how much it’s shifted, and then use the Doppler formula to estimate the star’s speed.
