Let’s take a closer look at Octave.
Octave is a scientific programming language that mirrors MATLAB’s syntax and functionality. It’s free, open-source, and available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. You can run it in the browser using Octave Online.
The interface looks different, but under the hood, many of the same commands will work — especially those used for basic matrix operations, plotting, and simple scripts. This makes Octave a reliable backup if MATLAB access is delayed or limited.
While it might not support all specialized toolboxes or image processing features, it’s more than enough for getting started and building foundational skills, at least for this course.
