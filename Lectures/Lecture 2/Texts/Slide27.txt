Sometimes you don’t need the full file — you just want a specific line. Maybe line two contains Joe’s entry, and that’s all you care about.
In this case, you can tell MATLAB to skip one line, and then read just one. You still use textread, but now with two extra options: the number of lines to read, and the number of header lines to skip.
This lets you directly target a record without loading everything — useful for indexed data, or when you’re debugging or sampling from a large file.
