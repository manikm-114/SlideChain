Let’s switch gears to 3D graphics.
Here, we’re creating a cone using MATLAB’s cylinder function.
We define a shape with the vector: t equals zero, one, zero. This gives us a cone shape.
Then we call the cylinder function to get the X, Y, and Z coordinates, and use surf to draw the 3D surface.
This shows how easily you can build and visualize 3D shapes in MATLAB — helpful for both learning and engineering.
