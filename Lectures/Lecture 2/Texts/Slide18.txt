Let’s talk about control flow — specifically, loops.
Start with a for loop. Use it when you know how many times you want to repeat something.
For example:Set x to zero.Then, for i from 1 to 5 in steps of 2 — so, 1, 3, and 5 —we add i to x.At the end, x equals 9.
for loops are useful when working through a known sequence.
Now, a while loop runs as long as a condition is true.
In this example:Start with x equal to 7.While x is greater than or equal to zero, subtract 2 each time.The loop stops when x becomes negative.
Just be careful — if the condition never becomes false, the loop won’t stop.
Finally, break lets you exit a loop early.It’s useful if you find what you need before the loop finishes.In nested loops, it only exits the innermost one.Use it wisely — don’t skip steps that still matter.
