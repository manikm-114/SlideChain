We are right on schedule in our journey through this material.

If you’ve already previewed the reading materials related to today’s lecture, excellent! That head start will help you connect concepts more easily. If not, no worries. I do encourage you to follow along closely and review key ideas afterward. This habit of reinforcing concepts as you progress will help you build a stronger, more intuitive understanding, especially as the ideas become more mathematically involved.
