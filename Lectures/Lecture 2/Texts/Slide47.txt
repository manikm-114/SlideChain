Next up — the Optimization Toolbox.
This one’s all about solving problems where you want to find the best outcome — like minimizing cost, or maximizing performance.
You can solve linear programs, quadratic programs, and nonlinear problems. It also supports multi-objective optimization.
It’s useful in many fields — from data fitting and machine learning to operations research. If your work involves tuning models or decision-making, this toolbox is essential.
