Now let me address a common issue students often encounter early on — installation problems with MATLAB.
Here’s a message I received from a student. He was unable to install MATLAB on his computer because of authentication issues with CAS — something that happens occasionally, especially at the beginning of the semester. The good news is that this is fixable, and you’re not alone.
If you experience something similar, please reach out early. Visit the RPI Help Center, and they’ll assist you with installing MATLAB. And of course, please feel free to contact me or the teaching assistant — we’re here to help.
