Now let’s look at logical operations in MATLAB.
You can compare values using operators like:double equals, less than, greater than, or not equals, which is written as tilde equals.
The tilde symbol means not.For combining conditions, use ampersand for AND, and vertical bar for OR.
To find specific values in an array, use the find function.For example: find A equals three — gives you the positions where A is exactly three.
These logical tools are great for filtering data and writing conditional code.
