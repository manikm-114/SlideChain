If you're unable to install MATLAB on your own machine, don’t worry — you still have options.
One solution is MATLAB Online, a browser-based version provided by MathWorks. You can access it from any modern browser without installing anything on your device. Just search “run MATLAB online,” and you’ll find the link right away.
Another option is Octave Online. It’s a free, open-source alternative that supports many MATLAB commands. While it doesn’t include all the advanced toolboxes, it’s good enough for our assignments.
So remember, lack of installation shouldn’t be a blocker preventing you from doing homework. There are various ways to stay engaged and complete your tasks — all you need is a browser and a willingness.
