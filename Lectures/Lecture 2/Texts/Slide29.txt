Next, let’s see how to keep a record of your work using the diary command.
Start with diary followed by a filename. From that point on, everything you type and everything MATLAB prints will be saved in a log file. Once you’re done, stop the recording by typing diary off.
This is great for tracking your workflow, recording sessions, or saving what you’ve done for future reference or reporting.
Now, another useful tool is timing. If you want to measure how long your code takes to run, just put tic before the commands, and toc after them. MATLAB will show you the elapsed time in seconds.
This helps you compare different methods and optimize performance.
