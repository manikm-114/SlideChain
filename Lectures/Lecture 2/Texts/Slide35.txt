This example shows how plot resolution affects curve smoothness.
In a loop, we increase the number of x-values using linspace, then compute y equals x over one plus x squared.
We plot each result in a subplot grid, with labels and titles showing the resolution.
With each pause, you can see the graph getting smoother — a great way to visualize the impact of sampling density.
