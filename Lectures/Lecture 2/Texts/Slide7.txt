The very first step is to install and activate MATLAB.
If you’re at RPI, you can download MATLAB directly from the campus software portal: dotcio.rpi.edu/services/software-labs. Make sure to follow the installation instructions that match your operating system — whether you're on Windows, macOS, or Linux.
During the installation, you’ll be asked to enter a product key to activate the software. This key is provided by the institution, and it unlocks your licensed access.
If you run into any issues during the setup — like installation errors or activation trouble — don’t hesitate to reach out. You can consult the help center, or message me directly. We're here to help you get started smoothly.
Having MATLAB set up and ready prepares us well before diving into hands-on examples.
