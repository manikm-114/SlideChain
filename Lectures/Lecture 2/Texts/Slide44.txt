Here’s the full example, all in one place.
We define t as a vector with values zero, one, zero. Then we call the cylinder function to generate the geometry, and use surf to plot it.
That’s it — three lines of code give us a smooth 3D cone you can rotate, zoom, and customize. You can even add lights, shadows, or change the viewing angle.
It’s a simple example, but it shows the power of MATLAB for 3D visualization.
