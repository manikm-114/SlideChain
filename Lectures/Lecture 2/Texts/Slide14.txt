MATLAB also makes it easy to generate special-purpose matrices, which are often useful for setting up or testing algorithms.
For example, diag of v creates a diagonal matrix from a vector. You can also reverse it: diag of A pulls the diagonal elements from a matrix.
If you need an identity matrix — that’s a square matrix with ones on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere — just write eye of n.
To create a matrix full of zeros, use zeros of m and n. If you need one filled with ones, use ones of m and n.
These kinds of matrices are especially useful when initializing arrays before filling them with computed values.
