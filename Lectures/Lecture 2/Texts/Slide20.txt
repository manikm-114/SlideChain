Now let’s talk about vectorization — one of the most important habits in MATLAB programming.
Here’s the idea. Instead of looping through each element one by one, we apply an operation to the whole array at once.
For example:Let’s say x is the vector — one, two, three.Using a loop, we would add five to each element, one at a time.But with vectorization, we just say: x equals x plus five — and MATLAB does it all at once.
Same result, much faster, much cleaner.
Whenever you can, avoid loops. Use vectorized operations. MATLAB is built for that.
