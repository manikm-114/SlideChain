Now let’s talk about reading and writing data files.
To open a file, use f open, and pass the file name and read mode.For example: f open in dot dat, r t.
This gives you a file ID — or fid.
Use f scanf to read numbers from the file.When you're done, always close the file using f close.
If you need formatting help, use help textread or help f printf.
Below is an example of a data file — it has names, types, numbers, and yes or no labels.
You’ll often need to work with mixed data — so learning how to read from and write to files is essential in MATLAB workflows.
