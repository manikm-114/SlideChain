Now that you have MATLAB installed, let’s talk about how to launch it.
If you’re using Windows, just go to your start menu or applications folder and open MATLAB like any other program. On Linux, you’ll typically launch it from the terminal by typing matlab.
Once MATLAB starts, you’ll see what’s called the MATLAB desktop — this is the main environment where everything happens. You’ll notice a command window for typing code, a workspace that keeps track of your variables, a file browser, and an editor where you can write and save scripts.
Take a few minutes to get familiar with this layout. Learning your way around now will help you feel more confident and efficient as we go forward.
