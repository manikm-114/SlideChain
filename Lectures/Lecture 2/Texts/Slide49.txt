The Symbolic Math Toolbox brings exact math into MATLAB.
Instead of working with numbers alone, you can define symbolic variables and compute exact derivatives, integrals, or solutions to equations.
For example, you can write a function like f of x equals x squared times sine x and ask MATLAB to find its derivative. You’ll get the answer in symbolic form — not an approximation.
You can also plot these expressions or export them into Simulink for simulation.
It’s a great toolbox for exploring math symbolically, especially in calculus and algebra-heavy problems.
