To test our new function, we write a quick script.
We choose a matrix size n, generate two random n-by-n matrices A and B, and call our matrix_multiply function to compute the result.
You can also compare it to MATLAB’s built-in multiplication to check for accuracy.
And here’s something to think about — this triple-loop method works, but it’s not fast. Later on, we’ll talk about how to rewrite this using vectorized operations to make it much more efficient.
