Let’s talk about the two main types of files you’ll create in MATLAB — scripts and functions.
Scripts are simple. They run a series of commands and use variables already in your workspace. You don’t pass anything in, and they don’t return anything out. They’re great for quick experiments or automation.
Functions, on the other hand, are more structured. You give them inputs, and they return outputs. Inside a function, all variables are local — meaning they don’t interfere with anything else in your workspace.
Knowing when to use a script or a function is key to writing clean, reliable code.
