So far we’ve looked at reading files — now let’s switch to writing.
To write data out, open a file in write mode using fopen. Then use fprintf to format the output line, inserting variables in the order you want them saved.
For example, you can save name, type, and numerical values all in one line. And as always, once writing is done, make sure to close the file with fclose.
This gives you full control over the format, spacing, and layout of your data. Very useful when preparing results for review, or generating output for other software to read.
