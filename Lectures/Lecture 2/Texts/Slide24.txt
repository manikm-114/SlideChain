Here are a few examples of what you can do with MATLAB plots.
You’ll see grouped bar charts, stacked bars, 2D lines, and 3D surfaces — all using basic commands.
Try different styles, colors, and layouts to get the look you want.
Good visualization tells a story — not just numbers, but patterns, relationships, and insights.
Use plots not just to check results, but to communicate them clearly.
