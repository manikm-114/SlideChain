Now let’s write our own matrix multiplication function — no built-in functions allowed.
We create a function called matrix_multiply that takes two square matrices and a size n.
Using three nested loops, we compute the product row by row and column by column. For each entry in the result, we take a dot product between a row of A and a column of B.
This hands-on approach shows exactly how matrix multiplication works under the hood — which is important to understand before we talk about optimization.
