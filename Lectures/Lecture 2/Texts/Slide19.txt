Let’s talk about how we make decisions in MATLAB.

First, the if statement.
You might say:“If x is equal to 3, display: the value of x is 3.If x is equal to 5, display: the value of x is 5.Otherwise, display: the value of x is not 3 or 5.”
This allows the program to choose what to do based on the value of x.
Now, when you want to check one variable against several specific values, a switch statement is better.

For example:“If face is 1, say: rolled a one.If face is 2, say: rolled a two.Otherwise, say: rolled a number greater than or equal to three.”
This is easier to read than writing multiple if statements. And in MATLAB, the switch ends automatically — no need for a break.
