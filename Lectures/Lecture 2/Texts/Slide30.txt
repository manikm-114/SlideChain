One of the key ideas in MATLAB is that everything is a matrix.
A single number? That’s just a one-by-one matrix.A row of numbers is a row vector. A column is a column vector.And an image? That’s a two-dimensional matrix.If it’s in color, it becomes three-dimensional — width, height, and color channels.
This matrix mindset makes MATLAB powerful and consistent across tasks — whether you're doing math, image processing, or even machine learning.
Now, let’s talk about indexing. If you have a matrix A:A of i comma j gives the element in row i and column j.A of i comma colon gives the entire i-th row.A of colon comma j gives the whole j-th column.
You can reshape matrices, slice out parts, or use logical masks to filter data.
To modify the matrix, use expressions like A plus five — which adds five to every element.Or A dot star B — for element-by-element multiplication.
This is the foundation of MATLAB — matrix thinking in everything you do
