Let’s try a simple numerical task: summing one over i squared, from i equals 1 to 10.
We can do this two ways — forward, starting from i equals 1, or backward, starting from i equals 10.
The code is nearly identical, just with the loop going in reverse.
Now, in theory, both results should be the same. But because of floating-point rounding, the order can make a small difference. This is a great example of how numerical stability matters — especially in scientific computing.
