Suppose we define:v as a row vector equals negative two, three, zero, four point five, and negative one point five.To make it a column, we write: v equals v prime — using the transpose.
To access elements:v of one gives the first,v of two to four gives the second to fourth,and v of three and five gives just those two.
You can also create sequences.For example: v equals four to two, stepping by negative one — gives four, three, two.
And combining vectors is easy.If a equals one to three, and b equals two to three,then c equals a b — gives one, two, three, two, three.
