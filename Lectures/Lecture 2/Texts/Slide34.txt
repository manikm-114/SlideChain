Here’s how we morph faces using matrix tools.
We warp two face images using interpolation on each color channel. Then blend them using a weighted average — with alpha controlling the mix.
To detect unusual pixels, we reshape the image and compute the Mahalanobis distance from a reference color.
Next, we create a binary mask by thresholding the distance, and apply a median filter to clean it up.
It’s a compact example of how MATLAB combines image warping, statistics, and filtering — all with matrices.
