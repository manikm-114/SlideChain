Now let’s add a third dimension.
Use plot 3 of x, y, z to make a 3D line plot.
For surfaces, use the mesh command — it draws a grid over the surface defined by z values.
If you want a contour plot — use contour z matrix. That shows level curves of a surface.
You can also control the axis limits with axis, add a title with title, and label the axes using x label and y label.
To explain the meaning of different curves, use legend.
