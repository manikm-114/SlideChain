Sometimes, you want to show several plots in one window.
Use the subplot command to divide the figure into a grid.For example, subplot 2, 3, 1 creates two rows and three columns — and selects the first cell.
Each subplot acts like an independent plot. You can add titles, labels, and style just like a regular figure.
This is helpful when comparing outputs or organizing results cleanly on a single screen.
