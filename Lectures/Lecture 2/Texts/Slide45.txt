Now let’s explore the Image Processing Toolbox.
It includes powerful tools for loading, modifying, analyzing, and segmenting images.
You can sharpen edges, enhance contrast, or isolate bright regions. It even lets you analyze object shapes and intensities — which is essential in fields like medical imaging.
You can also use it to register images, align features, and prepare large datasets for analysis. And if needed, you can even accelerate the workflow with C or C++ code.
This toolbox makes MATLAB a great platform for both learning and real-world applications in imaging.
