Now we move into data science with the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox.
This toolbox helps you analyze data, test hypotheses, and build predictive models.
You can use it for clustering, regression, dimensionality reduction, or training classifiers. It also supports parallel computing, which is great for handling large datasets.
And the best part? Many of these features work with just a few lines of code — so you can try powerful techniques without writing complex algorithms from scratch.
