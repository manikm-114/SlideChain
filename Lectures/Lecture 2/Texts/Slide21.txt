Let’s look at how MATLAB handles basic plots.
Start by generating x values from minus one to one using linspace. Then take the sine of x to get y.
Use plot x and y to create a basic line graph.
To change the appearance, you can specify style and color. For example, plot x, y, black line draws the line in black.
Use hold on if you want to overlay another plot on the same figure.Use figure to open a new figure window for a separate plot.
Plotting helps visualize data — and it’s built into MATLAB as a core strength.
