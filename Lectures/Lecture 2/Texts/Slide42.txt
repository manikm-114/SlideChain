Here’s how we do that in MATLAB.
First, we compute the wavelength range using the start point, number of data points, and spacing. Then, we build a vector of wavelengths.
Next, we plot the spectrum and locate the lowest point — which marks the Hydrogen-alpha line. Its position gives us the shifted wavelength.
Using the Doppler shift formula, we compute the redshift, then multiply by 300,000 — the speed of light in kilometers per second — to get the star’s velocity.
Just a few lines of code, and we’re measuring motion across space.
