Let’s see how to create and work with matrices in MATLAB.
To get evenly spaced numbers, use linspace.For example:x equals linspace from minus pi to pi, with 10 points — gives 10 values across that range.For logarithmic spacing, use logspace.
To define a matrix, write:A equals square bracket one two three; four five six — that gives a two-by-three matrix.
To access elements:A of one, two gives the value in the first row, second column.A colon, two returns the second column.A two, colon gives the second row.
You can add, subtract, or scale matrices like:A plus B, or two times A.
Use A star B for matrix multiplication,and A dot star B for element-by-element.
Transpose with A prime,and get the determinant using det of A.
