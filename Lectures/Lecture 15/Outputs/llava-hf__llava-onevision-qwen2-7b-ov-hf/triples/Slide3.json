Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, before we dive into today’s material, just a quick reminder.\u000b\nIf you’d like to follow along with the examples, please make sure you have MATLAB installed, along with the Signal Processing Toolbox and the Image Processing Toolbox. These are essential for running the code.\n\nIf you haven’t set this up yet, don’t worry—it’s simple. Just download the zip file I’ve posted on LMS, extract all the files, and place them into your MATLAB folder. Once that’s done, you’ll be ready to run the scripts, either as we go through them in class or later on your own time at home.\nAlright, with that setup in place, let’s move on to the theory of CT.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"MATLAB\", \"p\":\"uses\", \"o\":\"Signal Processing Toolbox\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"Just download the zip file I’ve posted on LMS, extract all the files, and place them into your MATLAB folder.\"}\n  ]\n}",
