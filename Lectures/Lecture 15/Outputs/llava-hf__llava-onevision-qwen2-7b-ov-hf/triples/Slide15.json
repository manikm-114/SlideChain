Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s look at our first MATLAB example for parallel-beam CT.\n\nIf you’ve downloaded the materials, the code is called E x 1 parallel dot m. You can try running it now or later on your own. Inside the script, at line 5, there’s a variable called p type. By changing the p-type to 1, 2, or 3, you can switch between the three phantoms: the square, the circle with a small circle inside, or the Shepp–Logan phantom.\n\nHere’s what happens when you run the code. On the left, you see the image domain, in this case, just a simple white square. As the red arrow rotates, it represents the projection angle, which we call theta. Each angle contributes new data to the sinogram.\nOn the right, you see the sinogram domain. Notice how information is gradually added as theta changes. For the square, the sinogram has a symmetric, crisscrossing pattern.\n\nIf you switch to the second phantom—the large circle with a small white dot—the sinogram looks different. The small dot produces a wavy curve in the sinogram because the detector gets closer to and farther from the dot as it rotates.\n\nFinally, with the Shepp–Logan phantom, the sinogram becomes much more complex. There are many structures inside that phantom, and each one leaves its signature on the sinogram. This complexity is much closer to what you would see in a real CT scan of the human brain, where multiple tissues and structures contribute overlapping patterns.\n\nSo the sinogram is really just another way of saying: here’s how the object looks from every possible angle.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"MATLAB code\", \"p\":\"uses\", \"o\":\"code\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"You can try running it now or later on your own.\"}\n  ]\n}",
