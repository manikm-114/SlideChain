Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere’s something pretty cool to look at—this is filtered back-projection in progress.\nWhat you’re seeing here starts with the original sinogram. Then, as the algorithm processes each view, the back-projections are gradually added together. Step by step, the image begins to take shape.\n\nIt’s almost like watching the reconstruction unfold in real time. As more and more views are included, the overlapping lines come together, and the original phantom—or the sample image we started with—slowly reappears.\nThis gives you a visual sense of how CT actually builds up an image: not from a single snapshot, but from many projections combined through filtered back-projection.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"filtered back-projection\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"CT\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"This is filtered back-projection in progress.
