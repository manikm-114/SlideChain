Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAnd with that, we’ll wrap up today’s session.\nThank you all for joining the class and following along. We’ve covered a lot—from the basic theory of CT, to the Radon transform, back-projection, filtered back-projection, and finally MATLAB implementations for both parallel-beam and fan-beam geometries.\n\nPlease remember to finish your homework assignments and, if you’re interested, explore the optional design project for something creative.\n\nThat’s all for today. Once again—thank you, and I look forward to seeing you next time.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"CT\", \"p\":\"uses\", \"o\":\"Radon transform\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"We’ve covered a lot—from the basic theory of CT, to the Radon transform, back-projection, filtered back-projection, and finally MATLAB implementations for both parallel-beam and fan-beam geometries.\"}\n  ]\n}",
