Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s take a quick look at our course schedule to see where we stand.\u000b\nAs you can see, we’ve been moving steadily through the topics—starting with the basics, like introduction, systems, and Fourier series, and then building up to signal processing and MATLAB practice.\n\nCurrently, we are on track with the section on computed tomography, or CT. This means you already have the mathematical and signal processing foundation, and now we are applying it directly to medical imaging.\nSo yes, we are on schedule, and today’s focus on MATLAB and CT fits exactly into the larger flow of the course.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"CT\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"MATLAB\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"As you can see, we’ve been moving steadily through the topics—starting with the basics, like introduction, systems, and Fourier series, and then building up to signal processing and MATLAB practice.\"}\n  ]\n}",
