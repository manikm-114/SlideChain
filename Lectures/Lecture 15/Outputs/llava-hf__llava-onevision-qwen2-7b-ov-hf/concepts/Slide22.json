From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s look at MATLAB’s fanbeam function.\n\nIn this geometry, the X-rays don’t travel in parallel lines like before. Instead, they spread out in a fan shape from a single point called the beam vertex. You can see that illustrated here: the source is at the top, and the rays diverge outward, passing through the sample.\nOn the opposite side, we have the detector array that records how much of the X-rays make it through.\n\nThere’s also an important parameter here called D. This is the distance from the fan-beam vertex—that is, the source position—to the center of rotation of the sample. For something simple, like a square phantom, D might just be the length of the diagonal. For a human body, D would be the distance from the source to the center of the patient.\nAs in parallel-beam CT, both the source and detector rotate together around the object at different angles, which we denote by theta. By sweeping through all these angles, we collect the fan-beam projection data needed for reconstruction.\n\nSo, the fanbeam function in MATLAB allows us to simulate this geometry directly, bringing us closer to how modern CT scanners actually operate.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
