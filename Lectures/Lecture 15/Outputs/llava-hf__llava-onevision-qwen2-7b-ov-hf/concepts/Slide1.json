From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHello everyone, and welcome back.\u000b\nToday, we will give the last MatLab lecture to explore how it can be used to demonstrate CT image reconstruction, that you’ve been learning in this course.\n\nThe image you see here is an example from GE’s “Revolution CT.” This technology allows us to capture extremely high-resolution images of the human body. In this case, you can see a detailed 3D view of the skull, including the blood vessels—arteries, veins, and even tiny capillaries.\n\nIf you’re curious, the link at the bottom of the slide will take you to the website where this example came from. They have several other fascinating images that show how CT technology is evolving to provide ever-sharper and more detailed views inside the human body. These advances are not just technical achievements—they are vital for clinical use, helping doctors diagnose and treat patients with much greater precision.\n\nAs we go through this lecture, I’ll also remind you that all the MATLAB code examples we’ll be using are available on the LMS. If you’d like to follow along or try them yourself later, you’ll find everything there.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"MatLab\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"CT image reconstruction\", \"category\": \"reconstruction\"},\n    {\"term\": \"GE’s ‘Revolution CT’ technology\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"high-resolution images\", \"category\": \"quality_metric\"},\n    {\"term\": \"3D view\", \"category\": \"anatomy\"},\n    {\"term\": \"blood vessels\", \"category\": \"anatomy\"},\n    {\"term\": \"arteries, veins, capillaries\", \"category\": \"anatomy\"},\n    {\"term\": \"diagnose and treat patients\", \"category\": \"communication\"},\n    {\"term\": \"MATLAB code examples\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"LMS\", \"category\": \"software\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"Hello everyone, and welcome back.
