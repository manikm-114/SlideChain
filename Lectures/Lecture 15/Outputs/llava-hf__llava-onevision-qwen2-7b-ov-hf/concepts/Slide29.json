From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAnd finally, let me remind you about your second homework assignment.\nFrom the Green Book, please complete problems 1.14, 1.15, and 1.18. \n\nIn addition, there’s an optional project for those of you who want to take on something more creative. As part of the Art_X initiative, you can design a concept for a portable CT scanner—for example, one mounted inside a self-driving car, or a CT scanner designed for a completely novel application.\n\nTo get inspired, I’ve included two references here at the bottom of the slide, which showcase some innovative CT scanner designs. These papers, including some from Dr. Wang’s group, may give you ideas for how CT technology can be adapted beyond the traditional hospital setting.\nAgain, the design project is optional—but the Green Book problems are required.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"CT scanner\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"portable CT scanner\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"self-driving car\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"innovative CT scanner designs\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"Art_X initiative\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"Green Book\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"problems\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"homework assignment\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"optional project\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"creative\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"Dr. Wang’s group\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"CT technology\", \"category\": \"physics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"adapted\", \"category\": \"physics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"beyond\", \"category\": \"physics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"traditional hospital setting\", \"category\": \"physics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"design\", \"category\": \"workflow\"},\n    {\"term\": \"concept\",",
