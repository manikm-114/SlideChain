From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s begin with parallel-beam CT.\n\nIn MATLAB, the main tool for simulating this is the Radon transform function, simply called radon. This function takes an image—our phantom—and generates its parallel-beam projections at different rotation angles.\n\nIn a parallel-beam setup, the X-ray beams are arranged so that they travel in perfectly parallel lines as they pass through the object and reach the detector. Each projection corresponds to summing the values of the image pixels along those parallel paths.\n\nSo when you hear me say “parallel-beam CT,” think of it as collecting straight, evenly spaced rays, rotating around the object, and storing all of that information in a sinogram. MATLAB’s radon function gives us exactly that.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
