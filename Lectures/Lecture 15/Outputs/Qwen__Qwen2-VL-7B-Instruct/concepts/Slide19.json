From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s walk through Example 2: Parallel-beam back-projection.\n\nThe code for this is called E x 2 parallel back dot m. Inside the script, line 32 runs a normal back-projection with no filter, and line 35 applies a filtered back-projection.\n\nIn this case, I’ve included the Hamming filter as an example. But MATLAB also supports other filter types, such as Ram-Lak, Shepp–Logan, Cosine, and Hann. You can even design your own filter and add it as an input if you want to experiment.\nNow let’s compare the results. On the left, you see the reconstruction of a simple white square using unfiltered back-projection. Notice how the image shows streaks and a kind of “cross” pattern—that’s the artifact caused by overlapping unfiltered projections.\nOn the right, you see the result with filtered back-projection. The square is much cleaner, with sharper edges and less background noise. The filter removes the smearing and helps reveal the actual structure.\n\nIf you change the phantom, such as using the Shepp–Logan phantom, you may notice that different filters give slightly different results. Some filters are better for enhancing edges, while others help reduce blurriness or noise. This is why in practice, the choice of filter depends on what details are most important for your application.\n\nSo this example shows us the power of filtering—without it, back-projection images can be full of artifacts, but with it, we get reconstructions that are much more useful and accurate.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
