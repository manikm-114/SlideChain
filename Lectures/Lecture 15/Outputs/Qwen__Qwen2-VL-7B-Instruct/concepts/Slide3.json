From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, before we dive into today’s material, just a quick reminder.\u000b\nIf you’d like to follow along with the examples, please make sure you have MATLAB installed, along with the Signal Processing Toolbox and the Image Processing Toolbox. These are essential for running the code.\n\nIf you haven’t set this up yet, don’t worry—it’s simple. Just download the zip file I’ve posted on LMS, extract all the files, and place them into your MATLAB folder. Once that’s done, you’ll be ready to run the scripts, either as we go through them in class or later on your own time at home.\nAlright, with that setup in place, let’s move on to the theory of CT.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
