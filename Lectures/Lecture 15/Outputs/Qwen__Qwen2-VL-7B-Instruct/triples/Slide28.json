Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThat wraps up our MATLAB section for today.\u000b\nYou’ll use MATLAB’s radon and iradon functions to work with an ellipse phantom—generate the projections, form the sinogram, and reconstruct the image.\n\nPlease make sure your submission clearly shows:\nthe input ellipse image,\nthe sinogram you generated, and\nThe reconstructed image (try both unfiltered and filtered back-projection, and note which filter you used).\nIf you run into issues, double-check that the Signal Processing and Image Processing Toolboxes are installed, and verify your angle settings and interpolation options.\n\nGreat work today. Next time, we’ll build on this and discuss how to interpret artifacts and improve reconstruction quality.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}",
