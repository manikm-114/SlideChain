Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAnd finally, let me remind you about your second homework assignment.\nFrom the Green Book, please complete problems 1.14, 1.15, and 1.18. \n\nIn addition, there’s an optional project for those of you who want to take on something more creative. As part of the Art_X initiative, you can design a concept for a portable CT scanner—for example, one mounted inside a self-driving car, or a CT scanner designed for a completely novel application.\n\nTo get inspired, I’ve included two references here at the bottom of the slide, which showcase some innovative CT scanner designs. These papers, including some from Dr. Wang’s group, may give you ideas for how CT technology can be adapted beyond the traditional hospital setting.\nAgain, the design project is optional—but the Green Book problems are required.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}",
