Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s turn to the second type of CT geometry that MATLAB can simulate, which is fan-beam CT.\n\nUnlike parallel-beam CT, where all the X-ray beams are perfectly parallel, in fan-beam CT, the rays spread out from a single source point, forming a fan shape as they pass through the object. This setup is much closer to how real CT scanners work today, because the source rotates around the patient while the rays diverge outward.\n\nAs I mentioned in class, fan-beam geometry introduces some additional considerations compared to the parallel-beam case, but it also gives us more realistic simulations. MATLAB provides dedicated functions to handle fan-beam CT, which we’ll look at in the next slides.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}",
