Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHello everyone, and welcome back.\u000b\nToday, we will give the last MatLab lecture to explore how it can be used to demonstrate CT image reconstruction, that you’ve been learning in this course.\n\nThe image you see here is an example from GE’s “Revolution CT.” This technology allows us to capture extremely high-resolution images of the human body. In this case, you can see a detailed 3D view of the skull, including the blood vessels—arteries, veins, and even tiny capillaries.\n\nIf you’re curious, the link at the bottom of the slide will take you to the website where this example came from. They have several other fascinating images that show how CT technology is evolving to provide ever-sharper and more detailed views inside the human body. These advances are not just technical achievements—they are vital for clinical use, helping doctors diagnose and treat patients with much greater precision.\n\nAs we go through this lecture, I’ll also remind you that all the MATLAB code examples we’ll be using are available on the LMS. If you’d like to follow along or try them yourself later, you’ll find everything there.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}",
