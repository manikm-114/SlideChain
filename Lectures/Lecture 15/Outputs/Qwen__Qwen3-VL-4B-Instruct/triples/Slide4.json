Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, let’s step into the theory of CT.\u000b\nWhat I’ll give you here is a general overview, much of which should feel like a review from our earlier classes.\n\nThe basic idea is this: CT uses X-ray projections taken from many different angles around the body. As the X-rays pass through, they are attenuated—that means they are weakened—depending on the different properties of the tissues they pass through. Dense tissues like bone attenuate more, while soft tissues attenuate less.\n\nBy collecting all these projections from multiple views, we build up enough information to start reconstructing what’s inside the body. That’s the foundation of computed tomography.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"s\": \"CT\",\n      \"p\": \"uses\",\n      \"o\": \"X-ray projections\",\n      \"modalities\": [\"text\"],\n      \"confidence\": 0.9,\n      \"evidence\": \"CT uses X-ray projections taken from many different angles around the body.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"s\": \"X-rays\",\n      \"p\": \"measures\",\n      \"o\": \"attenuation of tissues\",\n      \"modalities\": [\"text\"],\n      \"confidence\": 0.9,\n      \"evidence\": \"As the X-rays pass through, they are attenuated—that means they are weakened—depending on the different properties of the tissues they pass through.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"s\": \"CT\",\n      \"p\": \"reconstructs_with\",\n      \"o\": \"projections from multiple views\",\n      \"modalities\": [\"text\"],\n      \"confidence\": 0.9,\n      \"evidence\": \"By collecting all these projections from multiple views, we build up enough information to start reconstructing what’s inside the body.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
