Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow that we’ve seen how MATLAB generates fan-beam projections, the next step is to reconstruct an image from them. For that, we use the I fan beam function.\n\nHere’s what happens under the hood: I fan beam first converts the fan-beam data into equivalent parallel-beam projections. Once that’s done, it applies the same filtered back-projection algorithm we studied earlier to perform the inverse Radon transform and reconstruct the image.\n\nThe function looks like this:\nI fan 1 equals I fan beam F1, D, ‘Fan Sensor Spacing', dsensor 1);\nBreaking it down:\nIfan1 is the reconstructed image, the output.\nF1 is the sinogram data produced by the fanbeam function.\nD is the distance from the source to the object’s center.\n‘Fan Sensor Spacing' is the property name that tells MATLAB you’re specifying detector spacing.\nD sensor 1 is the actual spacing value.\n\nThe last two inputs are optional—you can let MATLAB use default spacing if you don’t need to adjust it.\nSo, just like with parallel-beam CT, we have a pair of functions: fan beam to simulate the projections, and I-fan beam to reconstruct the image. Together, they allow us to model fan-beam CT entirely within MATLAB.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
