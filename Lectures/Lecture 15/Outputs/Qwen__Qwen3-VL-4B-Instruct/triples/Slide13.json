Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s begin with parallel-beam CT.\n\nIn MATLAB, the main tool for simulating this is the Radon transform function, simply called radon. This function takes an image—our phantom—and generates its parallel-beam projections at different rotation angles.\n\nIn a parallel-beam setup, the X-ray beams are arranged so that they travel in perfectly parallel lines as they pass through the object and reach the detector. Each projection corresponds to summing the values of the image pixels along those parallel paths.\n\nSo when you hear me say “parallel-beam CT,” think of it as collecting straight, evenly spaced rays, rotating around the object, and storing all of that information in a sinogram. MATLAB’s radon function gives us exactly that.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"s\": \"Parallel-Beam CT\",\n      \"p\": \"uses\",\n      \"o\": \"Radon transform function\",\n      \"modalities\": [\"text\"],\n      \"confidence\": 0.9,\n      \"evidence\": \"In MATLAB, the main tool for simulating this is the Radon transform function, simply called radon.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"s\": \"Parallel-Beam CT\",\n      \"p\": \"produces\",\n      \"o\": \"sinogram\",\n      \"modalities\": [\"text\"],\n      \"confidence\": 0.9,\n      \"evidence\": \"MATLAB’s radon function gives us exactly that.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"s\": \"Parallel-Beam CT\",\n      \"p\": \"represents\",\n      \"o\": \"summing the values of the image pixels along those parallel paths\",\n      \"modalities\": [\"text\"],\n      \"confidence\": 0.8,\n      \"evidence\": \"Each projection corresponds to summing the values of the image pixels along those parallel paths.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
