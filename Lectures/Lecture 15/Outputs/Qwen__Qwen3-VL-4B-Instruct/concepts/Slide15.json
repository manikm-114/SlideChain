From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s look at our first MATLAB example for parallel-beam CT.\n\nIf you’ve downloaded the materials, the code is called E x 1 parallel dot m. You can try running it now or later on your own. Inside the script, at line 5, there’s a variable called p type. By changing the p-type to 1, 2, or 3, you can switch between the three phantoms: the square, the circle with a small circle inside, or the Shepp–Logan phantom.\n\nHere’s what happens when you run the code. On the left, you see the image domain, in this case, just a simple white square. As the red arrow rotates, it represents the projection angle, which we call theta. Each angle contributes new data to the sinogram.\nOn the right, you see the sinogram domain. Notice how information is gradually added as theta changes. For the square, the sinogram has a symmetric, crisscrossing pattern.\n\nIf you switch to the second phantom—the large circle with a small white dot—the sinogram looks different. The small dot produces a wavy curve in the sinogram because the detector gets closer to and farther from the dot as it rotates.\n\nFinally, with the Shepp–Logan phantom, the sinogram becomes much more complex. There are many structures inside that phantom, and each one leaves its signature on the sinogram. This complexity is much closer to what you would see in a real CT scan of the human brain, where multiple tissues and structures contribute overlapping patterns.\n\nSo the sinogram is really just another way of saying: here’s how the object looks from every possible angle.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
