From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAnd with that, we’ll wrap up today’s session.\nThank you all for joining the class and following along. We’ve covered a lot—from the basic theory of CT, to the Radon transform, back-projection, filtered back-projection, and finally MATLAB implementations for both parallel-beam and fan-beam geometries.\n\nPlease remember to finish your homework assignments and, if you’re interested, explore the optional design project for something creative.\n\nThat’s all for today. Once again—thank you, and I look forward to seeing you next time.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
