From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThat wraps up our MATLAB section for today.\u000b\nYou’ll use MATLAB’s radon and iradon functions to work with an ellipse phantom—generate the projections, form the sinogram, and reconstruct the image.\n\nPlease make sure your submission clearly shows:\nthe input ellipse image,\nthe sinogram you generated, and\nThe reconstructed image (try both unfiltered and filtered back-projection, and note which filter you used).\nIf you run into issues, double-check that the Signal Processing and Image Processing Toolboxes are installed, and verify your angle settings and interpolation options.\n\nGreat work today. Next time, we’ll build on this and discuss how to interpret artifacts and improve reconstruction quality.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Reject filler or administrative text.\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\n      \"term\": \"matlab's radon and iradon functions\",\n      \"category\": \"software\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"ellipse phantom\",\n      \"category\": \"anatomy\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"generate the projections\",\n      \"category\": \"data_processing\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"form the sinogram\",\n      \"category\": \"data_processing\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"reconstruct the image\",\n      \"category\": \"reconstruction\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"unfiltered and filtered back-projection\",\n      \"category\": \"reconstruction\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"try both unfiltered and filtered back-projection\",\n      \"category\": \"reconstruction\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"note which filter you used\",\n      \"category\": \"reconstruction\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"Signal Processing and Image Processing Toolboxes\",\n      \"category\": \"software\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"angle settings and interpolation options\",\n      \"category\": \"data_processing\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\n    \"You’ll use MATLAB’s",
