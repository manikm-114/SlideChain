From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere’s something pretty cool to look at—this is filtered back-projection in progress.\nWhat you’re seeing here starts with the original sinogram. Then, as the algorithm processes each view, the back-projections are gradually added together. Step by step, the image begins to take shape.\n\nIt’s almost like watching the reconstruction unfold in real time. As more and more views are included, the overlapping lines come together, and the original phantom—or the sample image we started with—slowly reappears.\nThis gives you a visual sense of how CT actually builds up an image: not from a single snapshot, but from many projections combined through filtered back-projection.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Reject filler or administrative text.\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\n      \"term\": \"filtered back-projection in progress\",\n      \"category\": \"reconstruction\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"original sinogram\",\n      \"category\": \"data_processing\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"back-projections are gradually added together\",\n      \"category\": \"reconstruction\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"the image begins to take shape\",\n      \"category\": \"reconstruction\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"as more and more views are included\",\n      \"category\": \"workflow\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"the overlapping lines come together\",\n      \"category\": \"reconstruction\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"the original phantom—or the sample image we started with—slowly reappears\",\n      \"category\": \"reconstruction\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"CT actually builds up an image\",\n      \"category\": \"modality\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"not from a single snapshot, but from many projections combined\",\n      \"category\": \"reconstruction\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\n    \"Here’s something pretty cool to look at—this is",
