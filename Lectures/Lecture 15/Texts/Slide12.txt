Now, how do we use MATLAB to demonstrate these CT principles?MATLAB gives us two distinct simulation paths: parallel-beam CT and fan-beam CT. We’ll explore both, step by step.

For our demonstrations, we’ll work with three simple phantoms—that is, test images used to evaluate reconstruction methods:
Square-in-square phantom: a small bright square centered inside a larger dark square.
Circle phantom with a nodule: a large gray circle with a small bright circle near the edge—think of that dot as a mock “tumor.”
Shepp–Logan phantom: a standard test object that comes with MATLAB. It’s widely used in our field, so researchers can compare results fairly—if two groups reconstruct the same Shepp–Logan phantom, their images are directly comparable.

We’ll first apply parallel-beam tools and then switch to fan-beam tools, so you can see how the algorithms behave on the same phantoms.
