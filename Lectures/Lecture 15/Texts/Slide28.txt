That wraps up our MATLAB section for today.
You’ll use MATLAB’s radon and iradon functions to work with an ellipse phantom—generate the projections, form the sinogram, and reconstruct the image.

Please make sure your submission clearly shows:
the input ellipse image,
the sinogram you generated, and
The reconstructed image (try both unfiltered and filtered back-projection, and note which filter you used).
If you run into issues, double-check that the Signal Processing and Image Processing Toolboxes are installed, and verify your angle settings and interpolation options.

Great work today. Next time, we’ll build on this and discuss how to interpret artifacts and improve reconstruction quality.
