Here’s something pretty cool to look at—this is filtered back-projection in progress.
What you’re seeing here starts with the original sinogram. Then, as the algorithm processes each view, the back-projections are gradually added together. Step by step, the image begins to take shape.

It’s almost like watching the reconstruction unfold in real time. As more and more views are included, the overlapping lines come together, and the original phantom—or the sample image we started with—slowly reappears.
This gives you a visual sense of how CT actually builds up an image: not from a single snapshot, but from many projections combined through filtered back-projection.
