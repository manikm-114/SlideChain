Let’s take a quick look at our course schedule to see where we stand.
As you can see, we’ve been moving steadily through the topics—starting with the basics, like introduction, systems, and Fourier series, and then building up to signal processing and MATLAB practice.

Currently, we are on track with the section on computed tomography, or CT. This means you already have the mathematical and signal processing foundation, and now we are applying it directly to medical imaging.
So yes, we are on schedule, and today’s focus on MATLAB and CT fits exactly into the larger flow of the course.
