And finally, let me remind you about your second homework assignment.
From the Green Book, please complete problems 1.14, 1.15, and 1.18. 

In addition, there’s an optional project for those of you who want to take on something more creative. As part of the Art_X initiative, you can design a concept for a portable CT scanner—for example, one mounted inside a self-driving car, or a CT scanner designed for a completely novel application.

To get inspired, I’ve included two references here at the bottom of the slide, which showcase some innovative CT scanner designs. These papers, including some from Dr. Wang’s group, may give you ideas for how CT technology can be adapted beyond the traditional hospital setting.
Again, the design project is optional—but the Green Book problems are required.
