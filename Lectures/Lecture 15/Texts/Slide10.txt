Now let’s move from simple back-projection to filtered back-projection, or FBP.

As we saw in the last example, back-projection is the standard way of reconstructing CT slices. We take the sinogram, back-project each view, and combine them. But here’s the problem: if we simply use unfiltered back-projection, the resulting image often looks blurry. That’s because the projections overlap in a way that smears out the details.
To fix this, we apply a filter in the sinogram space before back-projecting. Filtering helps sharpen the edges and preserve the fine details that would otherwise be lost.

Look at the images here. In the top row, we have a sinogram and its back-projected image. Notice how the back-projection produces just a fuzzy, grayish blob with poorly defined boundaries.

Now, in the bottom row, the sinogram has first been filtered. After reconstruction, the image is much clearer—you can actually see the circular structure with sharp edges, and even a smaller circle inside it, which could represent something like a tumor.
On the right side, you see examples of different filters that can be applied, such as the Ram-Lak filter, the Shepp-Logan filter, and the Hamming filter. Each of these adjusts the frequency content of the sinogram differently, but they all serve the same purpose: to enhance contrast and reduce blurring in the final reconstructed image.

So in summary, filtered back-projection is one of the most widely used methods in CT, because it gives us images that are both accurate and sharp enough for clinical use.
