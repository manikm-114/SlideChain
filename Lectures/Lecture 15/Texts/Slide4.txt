Now, let’s step into the theory of CT.
What I’ll give you here is a general overview, much of which should feel like a review from our earlier classes.

The basic idea is this: CT uses X-ray projections taken from many different angles around the body. As the X-rays pass through, they are attenuated—that means they are weakened—depending on the different properties of the tissues they pass through. Dense tissues like bone attenuate more, while soft tissues attenuate less.

By collecting all these projections from multiple views, we build up enough information to start reconstructing what’s inside the body. That’s the foundation of computed tomography.
