And with that, we’ll wrap up today’s session.
Thank you all for joining the class and following along. We’ve covered a lot—from the basic theory of CT, to the Radon transform, back-projection, filtered back-projection, and finally MATLAB implementations for both parallel-beam and fan-beam geometries.

Please remember to finish your homework assignments and, if you’re interested, explore the optional design project for something creative.

That’s all for today. Once again—thank you, and I look forward to seeing you next time.
