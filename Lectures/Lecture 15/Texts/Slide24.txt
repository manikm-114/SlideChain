Now that we’ve seen how MATLAB generates fan-beam projections, the next step is to reconstruct an image from them. For that, we use the I fan beam function.

Here’s what happens under the hood: I fan beam first converts the fan-beam data into equivalent parallel-beam projections. Once that’s done, it applies the same filtered back-projection algorithm we studied earlier to perform the inverse Radon transform and reconstruct the image.

The function looks like this:
I fan 1 equals I fan beam F1, D, ‘Fan Sensor Spacing', dsensor 1);
Breaking it down:
Ifan1 is the reconstructed image, the output.
F1 is the sinogram data produced by the fanbeam function.
D is the distance from the source to the object’s center.
‘Fan Sensor Spacing' is the property name that tells MATLAB you’re specifying detector spacing.
D sensor 1 is the actual spacing value.

The last two inputs are optional—you can let MATLAB use default spacing if you don’t need to adjust it.
So, just like with parallel-beam CT, we have a pair of functions: fan beam to simulate the projections, and I-fan beam to reconstruct the image. Together, they allow us to model fan-beam CT entirely within MATLAB.
