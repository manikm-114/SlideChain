Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere’s the idea in action.\nThis slide shows how inverse filtering works in the frequency domain.\nA sharp image, when convolved with a point spread function, results in a blurred image.\nIn the Fourier domain, convolution becomes multiplication.\u000bSo, the Fourier transform of the blurred image equals\u000bthe product of the transforms of the original image and the PSF.\nTo reverse this, we perform division in the frequency domain —\u000bthis is the essence of inverse filtering.\nIn the red box below, the image on the right is the transform of the blurred image,\u000bthe center is the transform of the PSF,\u000band the left is the result of dividing them — recovering the original image spectrum.\nApplying the inverse Fourier transform brings us back to the spatial domain.\nThis process forms the basis of many image restoration techniques.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}",
