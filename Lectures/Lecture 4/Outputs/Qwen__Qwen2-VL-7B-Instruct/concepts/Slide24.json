From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo whether we’re dealing with discrete or continuous systems,\u000bConvolution is the tool we use to compute the output.\nIn both cases, the idea is the same:\n\nFirst, express the input as a collection of impulses.\u000bThen, for each impulse, you already know the output — that's the impulse response.\u000bFinally, sum or integrate all of those individual responses to get the final output.\nThis process is captured using these two key equations:\nWe can see here discrete and continuous mathematical formulations.\u000b\nBut I know from experience that convolution can feel confusing at first.\u000bThat’s why it really helps to look at a concrete example.\nLet’s move on to one now.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
