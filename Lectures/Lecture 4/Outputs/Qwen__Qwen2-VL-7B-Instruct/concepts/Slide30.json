From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\n👉 Case 1: When t is less than –2\nAt this stage, the flipped and shifted version of g, written as g of t minus tau,\u000bis positioned so far to the left that it does not overlap with f of tau at all.\nThat means the product of the two functions is zero everywhere,\u000bso the convolution result y of t is also zero.\nThis is our first insight:\u000bNo overlap means no contribution to the integral, and the output is zero.\n\n\n Case 2: When t is between –2 and 0\nNow we begin to see partial overlap.\nAs g of t minus tau slides to the right, part of it starts to enter the region where f of tau is non-zero.\nLet’s break this down mathematically:\nOver the region where they overlap, f of tau is defined as\u000bf of tau equals negative tau plus 2, valid from tau equals 0 to tau equals 2.\nAnd the flipped rectangle, g of t minus tau, still has a constant height of 3 wherever it overlaps.\nSo we’re integrating the product of these two functions across the overlapping interval.\n\nThe simplifies convolution becomes:\u000b3 times the integral of (–tau + 2), from 0 to 2 plus t.\nIf you evaluate this integral, you get:\u000by of t equals negative three-halves t squared plus 6.\nSo the convolution result in this case is a parabolic curve, rising as t approaches zero.\n\nThis illustrates an important idea:\u000bConvolution is constructed from slices of overlapping areas —\u000band in each case, we’re summing the product over those intervals of overlap.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
