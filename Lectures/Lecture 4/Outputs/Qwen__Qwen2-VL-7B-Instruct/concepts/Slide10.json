From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThis brings us to an important mathematical idea — the limiting process, which gives us a way to model an ideal impulse.\nLet’s define a simple function — we’ll call it d tau of t.\nIt’s equal to one divided by two tau when t is between minus tau and tau.\n\u000bAnd it’s equal to zero everywhere else.\nSo again:\nd tau of t equals one over two tau, if t is greater than minus tau and less than tau.\u000bOtherwise, it’s zero.\nNow, as tau gets smaller and smaller, this function becomes taller and narrower, but the area under the curve remains exactly one.\n\nThat’s the key. As we shrink the width to zero — and the height grows without bound — we approach the Dirac delta function.\nMathematically, we say:\nThe limit of d tau of t, as tau approaches zero, is zero everywhere except at t equals zero.\u000bAnd at the same time,\u000bThe limit of the area under the curve — capital I of tau — is equal to one.\nIn other words, the delta function is infinitely narrow, infinitely tall, and yet has a finite area of one.\n\nThis makes it a perfect tool for modeling ideal impulses, especially when we need to represent quick, concentrated energy or a sharp event in time.\nAnd this idea will become central as we move into our discussion of convolution, where impulse responses help us understand how systems behave in response to various inputs.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
