From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nToday, we move on to our fourth lecture, where our focus will be on convolution.\n\nThis is a direct continuation of our recent discussion on systems, especially linear systems that are shift-invariant — two foundational concepts we began unpacking in the previous lecture. Understanding convolution will allow us to model how these systems respond to different types of input, and it's a concept that shows up across many areas in engineering, physics, and especially medical imaging.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Reject filler or administrative text.\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"convolution\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"linear systems\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"shift-invariant\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"input\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"engineering\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"physics\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"medical imaging\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"understanding convolution will allow us to model how these systems respond to different types of input\", \"a concept that shows up across many areas in engineering, physics, and especially medical imaging\"]\n}",
