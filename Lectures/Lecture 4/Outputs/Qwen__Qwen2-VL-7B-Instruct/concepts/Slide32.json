From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, let’s bring all the cases together to write the full piecewise definition of the convolution result.\nWe’ve carefully stepped through five distinct intervals,\u000beach showing how the amount of overlap between f of t and g of t determines the value of the convolution.\nPutting everything together, we now have the complete solution.\n\nEach case — from full overlap, to partial overlap, to no overlap —\u000bcontributes a segment of the final output.\n\nThis leads to a piecewise-defined function, expressed as follows:\ny of t equals 0,          for t less than –2\ny of t equals –three-halves t squared plus 6, for t between –2 and 0\ny of t equals 6,             for t between 0 and 2\ny of t equals three-halves t squared minus 12 t plus 24, for t between 2 and 4\ny of t equals 0,          for t greater than or equal to 4\nWhen we plot these expressions, we get a smooth, continuous curve —\u000bit rises, flattens out in the middle, and then gradually falls again.\u000bIt forms a kind of bump, which is exactly what we expect\u000bas g of t slides over and past f of t.\n\nThis example gives us a complete, mathematical walkthrough of continuous convolution —\u000bfrom defining the problem, to analyzing it case by case, to combining all pieces into the final solution.\nIt beautifully demonstrates how convolution is built:\u000bby accumulating the area under the product of two functions —\u000beach one flipped, shifted, multiplied, and then integrated, step by step.\nIt’s a powerful blend of geometry and calculus,\u000band it’s absolutely foundational in signal processing and medical imaging.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
