From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nBuilding on what we just discussed, here we observe something quite elegant:\nThe shape of the force curve — whether it’s a tall narrow spike or a wide shallow push — doesn’t actually matter when it comes to total impulse. What truly matters is the area under the force-time curve.\n\nThis area represents the cumulative effect of the force. So, a small force applied over a long duration can have the same impulse as a large force applied for a short time.\n\nIn system terms, different kinds of inputs can result in the same response if their total impact — the area — is identical.\nThis idea is central to convolution: we’re not just tracking individual values, but the accumulated effect of an input across time.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
