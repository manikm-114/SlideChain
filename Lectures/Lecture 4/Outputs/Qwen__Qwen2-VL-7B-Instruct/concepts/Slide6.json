From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s take a closer look at what that impulse does.\n\nWhen you strike a stationary object, like a golf ball, the force you apply doesn’t last long — it’s concentrated over a short time. But that momentary push has a lasting effect: it changes the ball’s velocity and sets it into motion.\nThis simple interaction captures an essential principle: an impulse causes change.\n\nIn the context of system analysis, we’re interested in how a system responds over time after receiving an impulse. That response — often called the impulse response — tells us how the system behaves dynamically. Once we know the impulse response, we can use convolution to determine the system’s output for any more complex input signal.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
