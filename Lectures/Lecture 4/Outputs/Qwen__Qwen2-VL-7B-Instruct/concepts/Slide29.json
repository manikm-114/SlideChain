From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, let’s work through a more abstract — and slightly more mathematical — example.\u000bI like to call this a minds-on example.\nThis example is based on continuous convolution, and while it’s not difficult, it does require you to think like in calculus.\nSo let’s take our time with it.\nWith convolution, the basic process is this:\u000bWe flip one function, shift it, multiply them point by point, and then integrate over the region where they overlap.\nAt first, that might sound a little mechanical. So let’s break it down clearly, step by step.\nWe’re working with two functions here:\nf of t, shown in red. This is a triangular function — it starts at zero, rises to a peak at t equals 2, and then drops back to zero.\ng of t, shown in purple. This is a rectangular pulse that spans from t equals minus 2 to plus 2, with a constant value of 3.\nNow, because g of t is symmetric, flipping it across the vertical axis doesn’t change its shape —\u000bwhich actually makes our job easier.\nSo we’ll flip g to get g of t minus tau, and then slide it across f of tau,\u000bevaluating the convolution at each position t.\nHere’s the key part:\u000bBoth functions are compactly supported, meaning they’re only non-zero over a specific range.\u000bThat means the overlap only happens during certain intervals.\nSo to compute the convolution, we’ll handle it case by case — based on the value of t.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
