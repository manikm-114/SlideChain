From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nCase 3: When t is between 0 and 2\nIn this case, the flipped and shifted version of g, that is, g of t minus tau,\u000bcompletely overlaps the triangular function f of tau.\nThis means we integrate across the entire support of f of tau,\u000bfrom tau equals 0 to 2.\nWithin this interval:\nf of tau equals negative tau plus 2\ng of t minus tau is constant at 3\nSo the convolution becomes:\u000by of t equals the integral from 0 to 2 of 3 times (–tau + 2), d tau\nWhen we evaluate this, we get:\u000by of t equals 6\nSo, for t between 0 and 2, the convolution gives a flat region with a constant value of 6.\u000bThis happens because the area under the product is the same across the entire interval.\n\n Case 4: When t is between 2 and 4\nNow, f of tau begins to slide out of the rectangular window of g of t minus tau.\nWe’re back to a partial overlap, but this time on the opposite side —\u000bthe right edge of g is moving past f.\nThe new overlapping interval runs from\u000btau equals t minus 2 to tau equals 2\nAgain, we use:\nf of tau equals negative tau plus 2\ng of t minus tau equals 3\nSo the convolution becomes:\u000by of t equals the integral from t minus 2 to 2 of 3 times (–tau + 2), d tau\nEvaluating this gives:\u000by of t equals three-halves t squared minus twelve t plus 24\nThis result traces out the descending part of the convolution curve,\u000bas the overlap shrinks toward zero.\n\n Case 5: When t is greater than or equal to 4\nAt this point, g of t minus tau has completely moved past f of tau.\nThere is no overlap between the two functions,\u000bso the convolution result once again becomes:\u000by of t equals 0\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
