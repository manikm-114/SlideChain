From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s see another example — this time from medical imaging.\nImagine you’re injecting a contrast agent, like iodine, into the bloodstream to highlight blood vessels in an X-ray image.\nWithout contrast, the blood, vessels, and surrounding tissue can look very similar.\u000bBut when you add contrast, the vessels light up more clearly, making them easier to detect and interpret.\nNow here’s the key part: as the iodine travels through the body, it moves along multiple paths.\nSome paths are fast — like major arteries. Others are slower — like capillaries or microvasculature.\u000bEach of these paths introduces a different delay before the contrast reaches the detector.\nIf you could inject an ideal, instantaneous impulse of contrast — in other words, a perfect delta function —\u000bthen what you would see is a collection of impulse responses, labeled here as H 1, H 2, H 3, and so on.\n\nEach of these responses corresponds to a different path, and each arrives at a different time.\nBut in reality, injections are not perfect impulses. They take time.\n\u000bThis means the actual contrast input is more spread out — and the measured output at the gamma camera\u000bbecomes a sum of all these delayed responses, weighted by how much contrast passes through each path.\n\nIn other words, the system’s output is a convolution of the injected input with the system’s impulse response.\nThis illustrates exactly why convolution is so important in medical imaging:\u000bit helps us model and interpret how signals — like contrast or radiation — travel through complex biological systems,\u000band how we capture those signals with imaging devices like a gamma camera.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
