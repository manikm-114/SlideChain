From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nA related concept to convolution is cross-correlation.\nMathematically, the key difference is in the sign of the shift.\nIn convolution, we compute the integral of f of x minus u times g of u.\nIn cross-correlation, it’s f of x plus u times g of u.\nSo, convolution flips one of the functions before shifting and multiplying,\u000bwhile cross-correlation does not.\nBoth are useful in signal processing —\u000bbut for different purposes, like system response versus pattern matching.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
