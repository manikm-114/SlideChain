From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nToday, we move on to our fourth lecture, where our focus will be on convolution.\n\nThis is a direct continuation of our recent discussion on systems, especially linear systems that are shift-invariant — two foundational concepts we began unpacking in the previous lecture. Understanding convolution will allow us to model how these systems respond to different types of input, and it's a concept that shows up across many areas in engineering, physics, and especially medical imaging.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
