From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nWe can even prove these properties. I won’t go through the full proof now, but it follows directly from how convolution is defined.\n\nHere, we start with the standard convolution definition:\u000by of n equals the sum over k of x of k times h of n minus k.\nBy substituting k equals n minus capital K,\u000bwe change the index of summation and rewrite the expression in reversed order.\nThis leads directly to:\u000bh convolved with x equals x convolved with h.\nSo, convolution is commutative — just like multiplication.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
