From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere, you can see the idea visually.\nImagine the original continuous function shown in gray.\u000bWe can approximate it piecewise using constant slices — small rectangles, each with a height that matches the continuous function’s value at that point.\nEach rectangle corresponds to a delta function, or a rectangular bar, scaled to match the original function’s height.\n\nThe key point is: the area under each rectangle is equivalent to the area under the corresponding delta function at that location.\nIn this way, everything ties together between the continuous and discrete perspectives.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Reject filler or administrative text.\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\n      \"term\": \"Imagine the original continuous function shown in gray.\",\n      \"category\": \"signal_processing\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"We can approximate it piecewise using constant slices — small rectangles, each with a height that matches the continuous function’s value at that point.\",\n      \"category\": \"signal_processing\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"Each rectangle corresponds to a delta function, or a rectangular bar, scaled to match the original function’s height.\",\n      \"category\": \"signal_processing\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"The key point is: the area under each rectangle is equivalent to the area under the corresponding delta function at that location.\",\n      \"category\": \"signal_processing\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"In this way, everything ties together between the continuous and discrete perspectives.\",\n      \"category\": \"signal_processing\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\n    \"Imagine the original continuous function shown in gray.\",\n    \"We can approximate it piecewise using constant slices — small rectangles, each with a height that matches the continuous function’s value at that point.\",\n    \"Each rectangle corresponds to a delta function, or a rectangular bar, scaled to match",
