From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nIn a shift-invariant system, if you know the system’s response to an impulse at one location, you can predict its response at any other location or time.\nThat’s because shift-invariance means the system behaves the same way, no matter where or when you apply the impulse.\nIf you apply an impulse at a different time or position, you can infer the output by simply shifting the known response accordingly.\nAnd because the system is linear, you have additivity and homogeneity.\nIf you scale an input, the output will be scaled in the same way.\nIf you add multiple inputs, the output will be the sum of individual outputs due to each input.\nThis is exactly why knowing the impulse response of a system tells you everything about how that system behaves — no matter what input you give it.\n\nTo summarize, for a shift-invariant linear system, given any input, we want to compute the output.\u000bThe critical information we rely on is the system’s impulse response.\u000bIf we know how the system reacts to a delta function at time zero,\u000bwe can use that as a building block to find the output for any input.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
