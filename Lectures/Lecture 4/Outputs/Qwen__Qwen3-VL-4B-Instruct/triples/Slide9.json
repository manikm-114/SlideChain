Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s extend that idea.\nImpulse isn’t limited to rectangular shapes. We can see in this graph that different Gaussian curves — whether wide or narrow, flat or sharp — can all serve as impulse-like inputs.\n\nWhat matters is the area under each curve. This area represents the total impulse delivered by the force, regardless of how the function looks. As long as that area remains the same, the impact on the system is the same.\nThis insight is critical in both physics and engineering: we often abstract away the exact shape of a signal and focus instead on its integrated effect — the impulse.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"s\": \"Gaussian function, several values of σ\",\n      \"p\": \"represents\",\n      \"o\": \"impulse-like inputs\",\n      \"modalities\": [\n        \"text\",\n        \"image\"\n      ],\n      \"confidence\": 0.9,\n      \"evidence\": \"We can see in this graph that different Gaussian curves — whether wide or narrow, flat or sharp — can all serve as impulse-like inputs.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"s\": \"area under the curve\",\n      \"p\": \"represents\",\n      \"o\": \"total impulse delivered by the force\",\n      \"modalities\": [\n        \"text\",\n        \"image\"\n      ],\n      \"confidence\": 0.9,\n      \"evidence\": \"This area represents the total impulse delivered by the force, regardless of how the function looks.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"s\": \"area under the curve\",\n      \"p\": \"remains the same\",\n      \"o\": \"as τ→0\",\n      \"modalities\": [\n        \"text\",\n        \"image\"\n      ],\n      \"confidence\": 0.9,\n      \"evidence\": \"d(τ) gets taller and narrower",
