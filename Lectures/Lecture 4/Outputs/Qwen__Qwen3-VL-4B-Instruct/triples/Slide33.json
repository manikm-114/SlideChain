Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, let’s look at a practical example that ties all of this together — the RC circuit.\nIf you’re not familiar with electrical circuits, don’t worry.\u000bFor our purposes, you can think of this setup as a black box.\u000bThe input is a signal, and the output depends on the system’s behavior — specifically, its impulse response.\nIn this circuit, we have a resistor R and a capacitor C connected in series.\u000bThe voltage signal going in is x of t, and the voltage across the capacitor is the output y of t.\nNow here’s the key point:\u000bIf we apply a delta function as the input — meaning a sharp, instantaneous impulse —\u000bthe output is the circuit’s impulse response, denoted h of t.\n\nThe h of t of the RC circuit is a decaying exponential. It tells us how the circuit reacts over time after a sudden input.\nBut what happens if we apply a more general input — like a square pulse or a step function?\nWell, just like we learned, we can decompose that input into a sum of small impulse components.\u000bEach tiny impulse generates a scaled copy of the impulse response, and the total output is the convolution of the input and h of t.\n\nWe can see this visually on the right:\u000bDifferent inputs — like short pulses or longer ones — are convolved with h of t,\u000band the resulting output curves smoothly reflect how the circuit responds over time.\nTry experimenting with this in MATLAB or Python.\u000bDecompose the signal, apply convolution, and see how the shape of the output curve emerges naturally.\nThis kind of modeling is not just useful for circuits — it’s a powerful tool in medical imaging, signal filtering, and physiological modeling, where systems respond to inputs in time-dependent ways.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
