Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s take a look at how convolution helps with feature extraction — especially edge detection — which is fundamental in medical imaging and computer vision.\nIn this example, we’re applying a Sobel filter, often used to detect edges in the horizontal direction.\nWe begin with the source image, represented as a grid of pixel intensity values.\u000bThe Sobel kernel, shown here as a 3-by-3 matrix, contains weights:\u000bnegative one, zero, and positive one across columns — designed to emphasize horizontal changes.\nHere’s what happens:\u000bWe align the filter over a 3-by-3 region of the input image.\u000bThen, we compute the sum of products between the kernel weights and the underlying pixel values.\nFor instance, at this highlighted region, the computation looks like this:\n –1 times 3, plus 0 times 0, plus 1 times 1,\u000b plus –2 times 2, plus 0 times 6, plus 2 times 2,\u000b plus –1 times 2, plus 0 times 4, plus 1 times 1.\nWhen we add those up, we get –3.\u000bThat value becomes the output for the corresponding destination pixel.\nNow, as the filter slides across the image — pixel by pixel — this process repeats.\u000bWherever there’s a strong horizontal transition, the filter produces a large response.\u000bWhere the region is uniform, the response is small or zero.\nThis is how edge detection works:\u000bIt uses convolution to detect where intensity changes rapidly, allowing us to extract important structural features from an image.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
