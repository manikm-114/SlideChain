Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere we observe a practical example of cross-correlation in action —\u000ba technique known as matched filtering, widely used in signal detection.\nIn the top plot, the blue curve shows a received signal that includes both the desired pulse and a lot of background noise.\u000bThe red curve represents the matched filter — a reference copy of the signal we’re trying to detect.\nThe bottom plot shows the cross-correlation output.\u000bNotice the sharp peak centered around one second — this is where the received signal best aligns with the matched filter.\u000bThat spike tells us that the target signal is present at that location in time.\nThis is exactly what the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality predicted:\u000bthe inner product, or correlation, reaches its maximum value when the two signals are best aligned.\nMatched filtering like this is essential in many fields:\u000bfrom radar and sonar, to wireless communication, and even in medical imaging —\u000banywhere we want to pull a weak signal out of noisy data.\nCross-correlation gives us a way to do that precisely and efficiently.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
