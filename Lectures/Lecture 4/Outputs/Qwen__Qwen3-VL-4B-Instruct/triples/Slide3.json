Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAs we step into the topic of convolution, let’s outline what we’ll be exploring today.\nWe’ll begin by revisiting shift-invariant linear systems, grounding ourselves in a concept we touched on earlier. Then, we’ll move into two important formulations of convolution: continuous convolution and discrete convolution.\n\nEach of them plays a crucial role depending on the context — continuous for signals that evolve smoothly over time or space, and discrete for digital signals and images. Through this lecture, we’ll examine both perspectives and their practical implications.\nBy the end of the course, you’ll not only understand how convolution works — you'll also appreciate why it matters in system analysis, image reconstruction, and the broader field of medical imaging.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": []\n}",
