Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nTo understand convolution deeply, let’s frame it through a familiar story from physics.\nYou might recall the idea — sometimes attributed to Newton — that the universe began with a single impulse, a sort of divine kick that set everything into motion. Whether metaphor or mechanics, this idea captures something fundamental.\nIn physics, we often model this idea of an initial force as an impulse — a very short burst of energy that sets a system into motion. For instance, think of hitting a golf ball with a club. That brief push is an impulse, and the ball's subsequent motion is the system’s response.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": []\n}",
