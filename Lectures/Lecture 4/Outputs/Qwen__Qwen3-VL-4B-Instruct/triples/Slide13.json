Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nBefore we explore how the delta function models sampling, let’s take a quick look at the integral mean value theorem — a fundamental concept from calculus.\nImagine we have a continuous function plotted over the interval from a to b. The area under the curve — shaded in green on the slide — is found by integrating the function from a to b.\n\nNow, here’s what the mean value theorem says:\u000bSomewhere between a and b, there’s at least one point, which we’ll call c, where the height of the function at that point — f of c — multiplied by the width of the interval, gives you the same area as the one under the curve.\nIt’s like finding a rectangle with the same base and the same area — it represents the \"average\" value of the function across the interval.\n\nThis concept of \"average value over a short interval\" will help us understand how the delta function works when it comes to sampling a continuous function.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
