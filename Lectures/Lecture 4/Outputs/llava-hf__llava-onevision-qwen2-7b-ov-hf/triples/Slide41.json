Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nWe can even prove these properties. I won’t go through the full proof now, but it follows directly from how convolution is defined.\n\nHere, we start with the standard convolution definition:\u000by of n equals the sum over k of x of k times h of n minus k.\nBy substituting k equals n minus capital K,\u000bwe change the index of summation and rewrite the expression in reversed order.\nThis leads directly to:\u000bh convolved with x equals x convolved with h.\nSo, convolution is commutative — just like multiplication.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"convolution\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"commutative\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"Convolution is commutative — just like multiplication.\"}\n  ]\n}",
