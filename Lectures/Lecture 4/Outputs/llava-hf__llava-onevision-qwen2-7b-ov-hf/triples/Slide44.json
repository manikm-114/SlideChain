Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nCross-correlation is deeply connected to the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality.\nThis fundamental result tells us that the inner product of two signals\u000bis always less than or equal to the product of their norms.\nMathematically, this absolute value of the inner product is less than or equal to\u000bthe square root of the sum of all the a k squared\u000btimes the square root of the sum of all the b k squared.\n\nEquality holds only when the two signals are proportional.\nThis is why cross-correlation works in this way:\u000bthe output is maximized when the signal and the template are aligned in shape —\u000ba key idea in pattern recognition and signal detection.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"cross-correlation\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"Cauchy–Schwarz inequality\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"Cross-correlation is deeply connected to the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality.\"}\n  ]\n}",
