Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo far, we’ve explored both the continuous and discrete versions of the delta function.\nBoth approaches give us ways to express functions as combinations of basic building blocks.\nWhether a system or phenomenon is fundamentally continuous or discrete isn’t always clear — think of water.\nWhen you see a flowing stream, it seems continuous. But if you zoom in, you’ll find discrete molecules.\u000bAnd if you go even deeper, those molecules follow the rules of quantum mechanics, where a continuous probability wave describes behavior.\n\nIn engineering, we switch between these views depending on what’s useful.\u000bA summation represents the discrete case. An integral represents the continuous case.\u000bThey are really two sides of the same coin.\nWith this foundation, we’re ready to move forward —\u000band explore how delta functions connect directly to shift-invariant systems,\u000bwhich play a key role in imaging and signal processing.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"delta function\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"shift-invariant systems\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<text from SLIDE_TEXT>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
