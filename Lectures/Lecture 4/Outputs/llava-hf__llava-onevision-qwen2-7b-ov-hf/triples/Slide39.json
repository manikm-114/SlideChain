Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nYou might not fully grasp this yet — and that’s perfectly fine.\nOnce we cover Fourier analysis, the connection between convolution and deconvolution will become much clearer.\nFor now, think of convolution and deconvolution as the advanced forms of multiplication and division,\u000bjust like integration is the continuous counterpart of summation.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"convolution\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"deconvolution\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"Once we cover Fourier analysis, the connection between convolution and deconvolution will become much clearer.\"}\n  ]\n}",
