Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo whether we’re dealing with discrete or continuous systems,\u000bConvolution is the tool we use to compute the output.\nIn both cases, the idea is the same:\n\nFirst, express the input as a collection of impulses.\u000bThen, for each impulse, you already know the output — that's the impulse response.\u000bFinally, sum or integrate all of those individual responses to get the final output.\nThis process is captured using these two key equations:\nWe can see here discrete and continuous mathematical formulations.\u000b\nBut I know from experience that convolution can feel confusing at first.\u000bThat’s why it really helps to look at a concrete example.\nLet’s move on to one now.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"convolution\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"collection of impulses\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"First, express the input as a collection of impulses.\"}\n  ]\n}",
