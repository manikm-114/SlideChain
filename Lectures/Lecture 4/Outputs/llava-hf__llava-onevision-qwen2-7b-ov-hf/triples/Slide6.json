Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s take a closer look at what that impulse does.\n\nWhen you strike a stationary object, like a golf ball, the force you apply doesn’t last long — it’s concentrated over a short time. But that momentary push has a lasting effect: it changes the ball’s velocity and sets it into motion.\nThis simple interaction captures an essential principle: an impulse causes change.\n\nIn the context of system analysis, we’re interested in how a system responds over time after receiving an impulse. That response — often called the impulse response — tells us how the system behaves dynamically. Once we know the impulse response, we can use convolution to determine the system’s output for any more complex input signal.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"impulse\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"change\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"an impulse causes change\"}\n  ]\n}",
