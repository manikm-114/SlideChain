Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nToday, we move on to our fourth lecture, where our focus will be on convolution.\n\nThis is a direct continuation of our recent discussion on systems, especially linear systems that are shift-invariant — two foundational concepts we began unpacking in the previous lecture. Understanding convolution will allow us to model how these systems respond to different types of input, and it's a concept that shows up across many areas in engineering, physics, and especially medical imaging.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"convolution\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"shift-invariant systems\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"Understanding convolution will allow us to model how these systems respond to different types of input.\"}\n  ]\n}",
