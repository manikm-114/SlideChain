Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s refresh our picture of a linear, shift-invariant system.\nImagine dropping a pebble into a still pond. No matter where the pebble lands, the ripples that form spread out in the same circular pattern. This uniformity — where the system’s response doesn’t change based on where the input occurs — is what we call shift-invariance.\n\nNow, relate this to medical imaging. Suppose you undergo a scan at one hospital today and another hospital next week. If your physiological condition hasn’t changed, you’d expect the scans to look the same. That’s shift-invariance in action — it ensures reliability across time and space.\n\nNext, we have linearity. It has two key components:\nAdditivity — if two features exist, like two separate tumors, the system should show the combination of both clearly.\nHomogeneity — if a feature changes in intensity, like a tumor growing larger, the imaging should reflect that change proportionally.\n\nTogether, these properties form what’s known as the superposition principle — the foundation for much of modern system analysis, including medical imaging.\nSo, as we move ahead, keep the ripple analogy in mind. It's a simple yet powerful way to visualize how linear, shift-invariant systems behave — consistently, predictably, and truthfully.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"linear, shift-invariant system\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"medical imaging\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"Imagine dropping a pebble into a still pond.
