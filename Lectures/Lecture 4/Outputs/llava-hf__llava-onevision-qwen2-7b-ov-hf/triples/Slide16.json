Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere, you can see the idea visually.\nImagine the original continuous function shown in gray.\u000bWe can approximate it piecewise using constant slices — small rectangles, each with a height that matches the continuous function’s value at that point.\nEach rectangle corresponds to a delta function, or a rectangular bar, scaled to match the original function’s height.\n\nThe key point is: the area under each rectangle is equivalent to the area under the corresponding delta function at that location.\nIn this way, everything ties together between the continuous and discrete perspectives.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<gray function>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<delta function>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"Imagine the original continuous function shown in gray.
