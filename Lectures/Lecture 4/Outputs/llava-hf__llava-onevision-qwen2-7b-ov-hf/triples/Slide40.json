Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nReturning to one-dimensional signals, convolution behaves like multiplication in several key ways:\nCommutative: h convolved with f equals f convolved with h.\nAssociative: h convolved with the result of f convolved with g equals the result of h convolved with f, then convolved with g.\nDistributive: h convolved with the sum of f and g equals h convolved with f plus h convolved with g.\nThese properties show that convolution is algebraically structured, and they will connect directly to Fourier analysis.\nYou’re invited to try a quick quiz:\u000bIf y of n equals h of n convolved with x of n,\u000bprove that y of n minus k equals h of n convolved with x of n minus k.\nThis follows naturally from the meaning of convolution.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"convolution\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"algebraic structure\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"Commutative: h convolved with f equals f convolved with h.\"}\n  ]\n}",
