Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow that you understand how 1D convolution works,\u000bit’s actually quite easy to extend the idea to two dimensions, especially when working with images.\n\nIn 2D convolution, you’re essentially applying the same process —\u000bbut now, instead of just one variable like t, you’re working with two:\u000bx and y in the discrete case, or tau one and tau two in the continuous case.\n\nLet’s take a look at the discrete form first.\nWe can see the formula at the top of the slide:\nf of x, y convolved with g of x, y equals the double sum\u000bover n 1 and n 2 of f at n 1, n 2 times g at x minus n 1, y minus n 1.\nJust like in 1D, we flip the kernel, shift it, multiply, and sum —\u000bbut now we do this across both rows and columns.\nIn the continuous case, we do the same thing using integrals.\u000bWe integrate over both variables — tau one and tau two —\u000bto compute the total area under the product.\n\nSo the core principle stays the same:\u000bFlip, shift, multiply, and sum or integrate —\u000bbut now it happens in two directions at once, across a 2D grid or surface.\nThis extension is especially important in image processing and medical imaging,\u000bwhere we often apply filters, masks, or system responses across 2D signals like slices or projection data.\nWhether you’re summing or integrating,\u000bconvolution gives you a systematic way to model how a signal transforms when passed through a system.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1].
