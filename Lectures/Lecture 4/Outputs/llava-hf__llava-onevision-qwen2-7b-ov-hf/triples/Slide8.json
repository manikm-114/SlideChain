Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nBuilding on what we just discussed, here we observe something quite elegant:\nThe shape of the force curve — whether it’s a tall narrow spike or a wide shallow push — doesn’t actually matter when it comes to total impulse. What truly matters is the area under the force-time curve.\n\nThis area represents the cumulative effect of the force. So, a small force applied over a long duration can have the same impulse as a large force applied for a short time.\n\nIn system terms, different kinds of inputs can result in the same response if their total impact — the area — is identical.\nThis idea is central to convolution: we’re not just tracking individual values, but the accumulated effect of an input across time.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"force-time curve\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"total impulse\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"The shape of the force curve — whether it’s a tall narrow spike or a wide shallow push — doesn’t actually matter when it comes to total impulse.
