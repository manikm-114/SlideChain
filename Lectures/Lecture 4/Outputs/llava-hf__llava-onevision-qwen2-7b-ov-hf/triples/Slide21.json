Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nIn a shift-invariant system, if you know the system’s response to an impulse at one location, you can predict its response at any other location or time.\nThat’s because shift-invariance means the system behaves the same way, no matter where or when you apply the impulse.\nIf you apply an impulse at a different time or position, you can infer the output by simply shifting the known response accordingly.\nAnd because the system is linear, you have additivity and homogeneity.\nIf you scale an input, the output will be scaled in the same way.\nIf you add multiple inputs, the output will be the sum of individual outputs due to each input.\nThis is exactly why knowing the impulse response of a system tells you everything about how that system behaves — no matter what input you give it.\n\nTo summarize, for a shift-invariant linear system, given any input, we want to compute the output.\u000bThe critical information we rely on is the system’s impulse response.\u000bIf we know how the system reacts to a delta function at time zero,\u000bwe can use that as a building block to find the output for any input.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"shift-invariant system\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"system’s response to an impulse\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"In a shift-invariant system, if you know the system’s response to an impulse at one location, you can predict its response at any other location or time.\"}\n  ]\n}",
