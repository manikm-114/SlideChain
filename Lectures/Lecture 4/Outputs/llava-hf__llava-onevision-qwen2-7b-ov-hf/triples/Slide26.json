Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s assign specific numbers to this example.\nSuppose on your left hand, your thumb has value 5, your index finger is 4,\u000bthen 3, 2, and 1 for the middle, ring, and little fingers.\nOn your right hand, the values go the other way — your little finger is 1, ring finger is 2,\u000band it increases up to 5 at the thumb.\nNow, flip the right hand — just like we flip h of n in the convolution process —\u000bthen slide it across the left hand, computing the pairwise products at each shift,\u000band summing them to get each value of the output.\nThis is exactly what’s happening in the MATLAB code shown on the slide.\nWe define x as the vector [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\u000band h as [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].\nThen we call y equals conv of x and h\u000band finally, we plot the result.\nThe plot shows a symmetric peak, just as we expect — the center point reflects full overlap between the two sequences,\u000band the values decrease symmetrically as they slide past each other.\nAlso remember: when you convolve two sequences of lengths n 1 and n 2,\u000bthe result will have a length of n 1 plus n 1 minus one.\nPracticing with simple examples like this helps you visualize and internalize the convolution process —\u000bflipping, shifting, multiplying, and adding.\nAnd in imaging systems, which are designed to be linear and shift-invariant,\u000bconvolution defines how the system responds to any input.\nThat’s why mastering this operation is essential.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"convolution\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"MATLAB code\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"'This is exactly what’s happening in the MATLAB code shown on the slide.'\"}\n  ]\n}",
