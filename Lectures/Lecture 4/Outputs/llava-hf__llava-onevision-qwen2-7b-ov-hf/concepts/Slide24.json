From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo whether we’re dealing with discrete or continuous systems,\u000bConvolution is the tool we use to compute the output.\nIn both cases, the idea is the same:\n\nFirst, express the input as a collection of impulses.\u000bThen, for each impulse, you already know the output — that's the impulse response.\u000bFinally, sum or integrate all of those individual responses to get the final output.\nThis process is captured using these two key equations:\nWe can see here discrete and continuous mathematical formulations.\u000b\nBut I know from experience that convolution can feel confusing at first.\u000bThat’s why it really helps to look at a concrete example.\nLet’s move on to one now.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"convolution\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"input\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"output\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"collection of impulses\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"impulse response\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"sum or integrate\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"discrete\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"continuous\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"formulations\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"concrete example\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"So whether we’re dealing with discrete or continuous systems, Convolution is the tool we use to compute the output.\", \"In both cases, the idea is the same:\", \"First, express the input as a collection of impulses.\", \"Then, for each impulse, you already know the output — that's the impulse response.\", \"Finally, sum or integrate all of those individual responses to get the final output.\", \"This process is captured",
