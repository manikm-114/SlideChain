From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s assign specific numbers to this example.\nSuppose on your left hand, your thumb has value 5, your index finger is 4,\u000bthen 3, 2, and 1 for the middle, ring, and little fingers.\nOn your right hand, the values go the other way — your little finger is 1, ring finger is 2,\u000band it increases up to 5 at the thumb.\nNow, flip the right hand — just like we flip h of n in the convolution process —\u000bthen slide it across the left hand, computing the pairwise products at each shift,\u000band summing them to get each value of the output.\nThis is exactly what’s happening in the MATLAB code shown on the slide.\nWe define x as the vector [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\u000band h as [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].\nThen we call y equals conv of x and h\u000band finally, we plot the result.\nThe plot shows a symmetric peak, just as we expect — the center point reflects full overlap between the two sequences,\u000band the values decrease symmetrically as they slide past each other.\nAlso remember: when you convolve two sequences of lengths n 1 and n 2,\u000bthe result will have a length of n 1 plus n 1 minus one.\nPracticing with simple examples like this helps you visualize and internalize the convolution process —\u000bflipping, shifting, multiplying, and adding.\nAnd in imaging systems, which are designed to be linear and shift-invariant,\u000bconvolution defines how the system responds to any input.\nThat’s why mastering this operation is essential.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"convolution\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"MATLAB\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"vector\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"sequence\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"length\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"flip\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"shift\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"multiply\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"add\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"symmetric peak\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"linear\", \"category\": \"physics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"shift-invariant\", \"category\": \"physics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"response\", \"category\": \"physics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"mastering\", \"category\": \"algorithm\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"Let’s assign specific numbers to this example.\", \n               \"Suppose on your left hand, your thumb has value 5, your index finger is 4,\u000bthen 3, 2",
