From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s now think about how this idea translates to the discrete case.\nYou can visualize a discrete function as a collection of rectangular bars — sometimes called gate functions. These bars represent values at specific, evenly spaced points — like sampling a continuous function at fixed intervals.\nHere you can see the mathematical expression in this slide.\n\nThis function is defined piecewise as follows:\nIt equals zero when the absolute value of t is greater than one-half,\nIt equals one-half when the absolute value of t is exactly one-half,\nAnd it equals one when the absolute value of t is less than one-half.\nIn other words, the rectangular function is centered at zero, has a total width of one, and represents a simple, finite pulse — like a short “on” signal.\n\nAt the bottom of the slide, we define the discrete delta function, written as delta of n.\nIt equals one when n is zero, and zero otherwise.\nSo delta of n is a single spike located at n equals zero.\u000bIf we shift it, like delta of n minus two, the spike moves to n equals two.\n\nThis function serves as the discrete version of the continuous delta function. By shifting and scaling these unit impulses, we can represent any discrete signal as a sum of these basic components — just like reconstructing a picture with pixels.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
