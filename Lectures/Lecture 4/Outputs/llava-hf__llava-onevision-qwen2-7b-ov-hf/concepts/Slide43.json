From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s take a closer look at the graphical differences between convolution, cross-correlation, and autocorrelation.\nOn the left, we see convolution.\u000bFunction f is in blue, and function g is in red.\u000bIn convolution, g is first flipped horizontally, then shifted, multiplied with f, and finally integrated or summed.\u000bAs g slides across f, the overlapping area is computed at each step — producing the black output curve below.\nIn the middle, we have cross-correlation.\u000bIt follows the same steps as convolution, except there’s no flipping of g.\u000bWe simply shift g across f, multiply at each point, and accumulate the result.\u000bSo visually, the shapes are the same, but the symmetry is different — this matters in pattern alignment and signal comparison.\nOn the right, we see autocorrelation.\u000bThis is a special case of cross-correlation where the same function is compared with itself.\u000bSo g and f are the same, and we measure how well the signal matches its own shifted versions.\u000bThe result usually peaks at zero shift — showing maximum similarity with itself — and falls off on either side.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"convolution\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"cross-correlation\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"autocorrelation\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"Let’s take a closer look at the graphical differences between convolution, cross-correlation, and autocorrelation.\", \"Function f is in blue, and function g is in red.\", \"In convolution, g is first flipped horizontally, then shifted, multiplied with f, and finally integrated or summed.\", \"In the middle, we have cross-correlation.
