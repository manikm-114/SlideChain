From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nYou might not fully grasp this yet — and that’s perfectly fine.\nOnce we cover Fourier analysis, the connection between convolution and deconvolution will become much clearer.\nFor now, think of convolution and deconvolution as the advanced forms of multiplication and division,\u000bjust like integration is the continuous counterpart of summation.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"convolution\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"deconvolution\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"Fourier analysis\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"multiplication\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"division\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"integration\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"Once we cover Fourier analysis, the connection between convolution and deconvolution will become much clearer.\", \"For now, think of convolution and deconvolution as the advanced forms of multiplication and division, just like integration is the continuous counterpart of summation.\"]\n}\n```",
