From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nIn reality, the contrast isn’t delivered as a perfect impulse —\u000bit’s injected over a period of time, with more at the start and less later, forming a time curve.\nWe can think of this non-ideal input as a sum of small impulses occurring at different times —\u000beach one representing a fraction of the total injected dose.\nFor each of these small impulses, we already know the system’s response —\u000bthat’s the impulse response we’ve discussed.\nSo what do we do?\nWe scale each impulse response based on how much contrast was injected at that moment,\u000bshift it in time according to when it was injected,\u000band then add all the individual responses together.\nWhat we get is the system’s total response — the final signal that’s measured by the detector.\nThis is a perfect visualization of discrete convolution in a real-world setting.\u000bIt shows how imaging systems handle non-ideal, time-varying inputs using the exact same principles we’ve learned.\nIt may take some time for these ideas to fully sink in,\u000bbut they form the foundation for understanding how imaging systems process signals and generate useful images.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"contrast injection\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"time curve\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"small impulses\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"fraction of total dose\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"impulse response\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"scaling\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"time shifting\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"discrete convolution\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"non-ideal, time-varying inputs\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"imaging systems\", \"category\": \"instrumentation\"},\n    {\"term\": \"processing signals\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"useful images\", \"category\": \"modality\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"In reality, the contrast isn’t delivered as a perfect impulse — it’s injected over a period of time, with more at the start and less later, forming a time curve.\", \"We can think of this non-ideal input",
