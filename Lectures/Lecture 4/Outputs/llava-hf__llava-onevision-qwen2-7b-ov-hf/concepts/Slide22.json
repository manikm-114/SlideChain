From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nTo be specific, now let’s see how we actually compute the output y of n of a shift-invariant linear system to an arbitrary input x of n, formulated on the 1st line.\nSuppose I give you a system characterized by its impulse response, written as h of n, which is shown on the 2nd line.\u000bThat means: if you feed the system a discrete delta function as input, the output will be h of n.\u000bThis response — h of n — is the system’s character.\nBut what if you give the system a more general input, say x of n?\u000bWhat will the output y of n be, which is what I just formulated on the 1st line, and a very important question.\nLet’s break it down step by step.\nSince the system is shift-invariant, if you shift the input by k, the output also shifts by k, shown on the 3rd line.\u000bSo if the input is delta of n minus k, the output becomes h of n minus k.\nThen, because the system is linear, if we scale the input by x of k,\u000bConsequently, the output is also scaled by x of k.\u000bThat gives us x of k times h of n minus k on the 4th line.\nNow, to get the total output, we add up all of these scaled and shifted responses.\nMathematically, this gives us the convolution sum, on the right-hand side of the last two lines:\ny of n equals the sum over k from minus infinity to infinity of x of k times h of n minus k.\nThis is how the convolution is defined, and also why we need this concept.\n\u000bIt shows why the impulse response is so powerful — it’s all you need to compute the system’s output for any input.\nNow, convolution might seem a bit tricky at first, especially because of the flipping and shifting involved —\u000bthat negative k inside h of n minus k could appear confusing.\n\u000bBut if you follow the logic step-by-step, the structure becomes clear.\nThis convolution concept is fundamental in linear systems and engineering —\u000band that’s why we dedicate so much attention to understanding convolution.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
