From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nReturning to one-dimensional signals, convolution behaves like multiplication in several key ways:\nCommutative: h convolved with f equals f convolved with h.\nAssociative: h convolved with the result of f convolved with g equals the result of h convolved with f, then convolved with g.\nDistributive: h convolved with the sum of f and g equals h convolved with f plus h convolved with g.\nThese properties show that convolution is algebraically structured, and they will connect directly to Fourier analysis.\nYou’re invited to try a quick quiz:\u000bIf y of n equals h of n convolved with x of n,\u000bprove that y of n minus k equals h of n convolved with x of n minus k.\nThis follows naturally from the meaning of convolution.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
