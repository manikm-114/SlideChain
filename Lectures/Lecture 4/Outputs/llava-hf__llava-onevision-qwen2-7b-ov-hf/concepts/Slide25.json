From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s consider a hands-on example using two discrete functions, each with five data points.\nNow imagine holding out both hands:\u000byour left hand represents one function — let’s call it x of n,\u000band your right hand represents the other — this will be h of n, the impulse response.\nBecause of that negative k in the convolution sum,\u000bone function needs to be flipped — think of it like flipping your right hand so you see the back of it.\u000bThat’s how we visualize h of n minus k.\nNow we shift this flipped function across the input and calculate the output step-by-step.\n\nFor n equals zero, you align the flipped function with the origin,\u000bmultiply the overlapping points, then sum the products —\u000bthis gives you the output y of zero.\n\nFor n equals one, shift the flipped function one step to the right,\u000bmultiply again, sum the result — and you get y of one.\nYou keep shifting, multiplying, and summing for each value of n.\nYou’ll notice that when the two functions fully overlap,\u000byou get the largest value in the convolution.\u000bAnd as they slide past each other, the overlap decreases,\u000bso the convolution value gradually falls back to zero.\n\nThis visual analogy with your hands is a powerful way to understand discrete convolution —\u000bespecially how flipping, shifting, multiplying, and summing all come together.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
