From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nCross-correlation is deeply connected to the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality.\nThis fundamental result tells us that the inner product of two signals\u000bis always less than or equal to the product of their norms.\nMathematically, this absolute value of the inner product is less than or equal to\u000bthe square root of the sum of all the a k squared\u000btimes the square root of the sum of all the b k squared.\n\nEquality holds only when the two signals are proportional.\nThis is why cross-correlation works in this way:\u000bthe output is maximized when the signal and the template are aligned in shape —\u000ba key idea in pattern recognition and signal detection.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"Cauchy–Schwarz inequality\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"inner product\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"signal\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"template\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"aligned in shape\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"pattern recognition\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"signal detection\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"Cross-correlation is deeply connected to the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality.\", \n               \"This fundamental result tells us that the inner product of two signals\u000bis always less than or equal to the product of their norms.\", \n               \"Mathematically, this absolute value of the inner product is less than or equal to\u000bthe square root of the sum of all the a k squared\u000btimes the square root of the sum of all the b k squared.\", \n               \"Equality holds only when the two signals are proportional.\", \n               \"This is why cross-correlation works in this way:\u000bthe output is maximized when the signal",
