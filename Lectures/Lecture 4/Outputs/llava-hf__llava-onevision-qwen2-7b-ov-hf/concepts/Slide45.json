From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere we observe a practical example of cross-correlation in action —\u000ba technique known as matched filtering, widely used in signal detection.\nIn the top plot, the blue curve shows a received signal that includes both the desired pulse and a lot of background noise.\u000bThe red curve represents the matched filter — a reference copy of the signal we’re trying to detect.\nThe bottom plot shows the cross-correlation output.\u000bNotice the sharp peak centered around one second — this is where the received signal best aligns with the matched filter.\u000bThat spike tells us that the target signal is present at that location in time.\nThis is exactly what the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality predicted:\u000bthe inner product, or correlation, reaches its maximum value when the two signals are best aligned.\nMatched filtering like this is essential in many fields:\u000bfrom radar and sonar, to wireless communication, and even in medical imaging —\u000banywhere we want to pull a weak signal out of noisy data.\nCross-correlation gives us a way to do that precisely and efficiently.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"cross-correlation\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"matched filtering\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"background noise\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"reference copy\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"peak\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"Cauchy–Schwarz inequality\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"radar\", \"category\": \"communication\"},\n    {\"term\": \"sonar\", \"category\": \"communication\"},\n    {\"term\": \"wireless communication\", \"category\": \"communication\"},\n    {\"term\": \"medical imaging\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"pull a weak signal\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"noise data\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"Here we observe a practical example of cross-correlation in action — a technique known as matched filtering, widely used in signal detection.\", \n             \"The bottom plot shows the cross-correlation output.
