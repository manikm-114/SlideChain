Today, we move on to our fourth lecture, where our focus will be on convolution.

This is a direct continuation of our recent discussion on systems, especially linear systems that are shift-invariant — two foundational concepts we began unpacking in the previous lecture. Understanding convolution will allow us to model how these systems respond to different types of input, and it's a concept that shows up across many areas in engineering, physics, and especially medical imaging.
