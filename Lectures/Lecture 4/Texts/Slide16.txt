Here, you can see the idea visually.
Imagine the original continuous function shown in gray.We can approximate it piecewise using constant slices — small rectangles, each with a height that matches the continuous function’s value at that point.
Each rectangle corresponds to a delta function, or a rectangular bar, scaled to match the original function’s height.

The key point is: the area under each rectangle is equivalent to the area under the corresponding delta function at that location.
In this way, everything ties together between the continuous and discrete perspectives.
