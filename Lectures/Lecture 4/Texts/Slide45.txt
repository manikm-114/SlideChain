Here we observe a practical example of cross-correlation in action —a technique known as matched filtering, widely used in signal detection.
In the top plot, the blue curve shows a received signal that includes both the desired pulse and a lot of background noise.The red curve represents the matched filter — a reference copy of the signal we’re trying to detect.
The bottom plot shows the cross-correlation output.Notice the sharp peak centered around one second — this is where the received signal best aligns with the matched filter.That spike tells us that the target signal is present at that location in time.
This is exactly what the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality predicted:the inner product, or correlation, reaches its maximum value when the two signals are best aligned.
Matched filtering like this is essential in many fields:from radar and sonar, to wireless communication, and even in medical imaging —anywhere we want to pull a weak signal out of noisy data.
Cross-correlation gives us a way to do that precisely and efficiently.
