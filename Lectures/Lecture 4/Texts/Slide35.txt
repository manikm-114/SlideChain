In imaging, 2D convolution is a powerful tool for modeling blurring.
Let’s take a look at how this works using a simple example.
On the left, we see an input image represented as a matrix of pixel intensities.Each number corresponds to the brightness level of a pixel.
In the middle, we see a 3 by 3 averaging mask.All entries are 1, and we divide the result by 9 —which means we’re averaging the values in a 3 by 3 window.
This operation is a 2D convolution:we slide the mask across the image, and at each position,we multiply corresponding elements, sum them up, and store the result in the center pixel of the output.
Let’s focus on the region that’s highlighted.
For the top-left example, the 3 by 3 neighborhood includes values like 1, 2, 3, and so on.When we sum those values and divide by 9, we get the blurred output value, shown in yellow.
The same thing happens throughout the image.Each pixel in the output image becomes the average of itself and its eight neighbors.
The result?Sharp transitions are smoothed out, fine details are softened —and the image takes on a blurred appearance.
This is a fundamental application of 2D convolution —and it’s used not only for visual effects, but also as a preprocessing step in many medical imaging tasks,like noise reduction and feature extraction.
