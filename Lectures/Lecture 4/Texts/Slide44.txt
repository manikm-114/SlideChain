Cross-correlation is deeply connected to the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality.
This fundamental result tells us that the inner product of two signalsis always less than or equal to the product of their norms.
Mathematically, this absolute value of the inner product is less than or equal tothe square root of the sum of all the a k squaredtimes the square root of the sum of all the b k squared.

Equality holds only when the two signals are proportional.
This is why cross-correlation works in this way:the output is maximized when the signal and the template are aligned in shape —a key idea in pattern recognition and signal detection.
