To understand convolution deeply, let’s frame it through a familiar story from physics.
You might recall the idea — sometimes attributed to Newton — that the universe began with a single impulse, a sort of divine kick that set everything into motion. Whether metaphor or mechanics, this idea captures something fundamental.
In physics, we often model this idea of an initial force as an impulse — a very short burst of energy that sets a system into motion. For instance, think of hitting a golf ball with a club. That brief push is an impulse, and the ball's subsequent motion is the system’s response.
