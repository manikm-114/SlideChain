Now, let’s look at a practical example that ties all of this together — the RC circuit.
If you’re not familiar with electrical circuits, don’t worry.For our purposes, you can think of this setup as a black box.The input is a signal, and the output depends on the system’s behavior — specifically, its impulse response.
In this circuit, we have a resistor R and a capacitor C connected in series.The voltage signal going in is x of t, and the voltage across the capacitor is the output y of t.
Now here’s the key point:If we apply a delta function as the input — meaning a sharp, instantaneous impulse —the output is the circuit’s impulse response, denoted h of t.

The h of t of the RC circuit is a decaying exponential. It tells us how the circuit reacts over time after a sudden input.
But what happens if we apply a more general input — like a square pulse or a step function?
Well, just like we learned, we can decompose that input into a sum of small impulse components.Each tiny impulse generates a scaled copy of the impulse response, and the total output is the convolution of the input and h of t.

We can see this visually on the right:Different inputs — like short pulses or longer ones — are convolved with h of t,and the resulting output curves smoothly reflect how the circuit responds over time.
Try experimenting with this in MATLAB or Python.Decompose the signal, apply convolution, and see how the shape of the output curve emerges naturally.
This kind of modeling is not just useful for circuits — it’s a powerful tool in medical imaging, signal filtering, and physiological modeling, where systems respond to inputs in time-dependent ways.
