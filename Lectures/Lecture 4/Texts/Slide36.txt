Let’s take a look at how blurring arises naturally in imaging systems — not just from digital filters, but from physical limitations.
Here we observe a key concept in optics called the point spread function, or PSF.
In theory, if you image a perfect point of light, it should appear as a sharp dot on the detector.But in reality, that point gets blurred into a small disk — often called an Airy disk —because of how light diffracts through the lens system.
This is the system’s impulse response in two dimensions.
So even if your input is just a single point — like a star in the night sky —the output captured by your imaging system is a small, spread-out shape.
And when two bright points are placed too close together,their point spread functions begin to overlap.This overlap makes it difficult — or even impossible — to tell them apart in the final image.
This phenomenon is at the core of what we call the resolution limit in optical systems.
In fact, PSFs are not just a curiosity —they’re mathematically modeled and measured,and they define how sharp or blurry every part of an image will be.
So in medical imaging, astronomy, microscopy —understanding the point spread function is essential to both image formation and image reconstruction.
