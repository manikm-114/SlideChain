Let’s take a closer look at what that impulse does.

When you strike a stationary object, like a golf ball, the force you apply doesn’t last long — it’s concentrated over a short time. But that momentary push has a lasting effect: it changes the ball’s velocity and sets it into motion.
This simple interaction captures an essential principle: an impulse causes change.

In the context of system analysis, we’re interested in how a system responds over time after receiving an impulse. That response — often called the impulse response — tells us how the system behaves dynamically. Once we know the impulse response, we can use convolution to determine the system’s output for any more complex input signal.
