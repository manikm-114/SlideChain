Let’s see another example — this time from medical imaging.
Imagine you’re injecting a contrast agent, like iodine, into the bloodstream to highlight blood vessels in an X-ray image.
Without contrast, the blood, vessels, and surrounding tissue can look very similar.But when you add contrast, the vessels light up more clearly, making them easier to detect and interpret.
Now here’s the key part: as the iodine travels through the body, it moves along multiple paths.
Some paths are fast — like major arteries. Others are slower — like capillaries or microvasculature.Each of these paths introduces a different delay before the contrast reaches the detector.
If you could inject an ideal, instantaneous impulse of contrast — in other words, a perfect delta function —then what you would see is a collection of impulse responses, labeled here as H 1, H 2, H 3, and so on.

Each of these responses corresponds to a different path, and each arrives at a different time.
But in reality, injections are not perfect impulses. They take time.
This means the actual contrast input is more spread out — and the measured output at the gamma camerabecomes a sum of all these delayed responses, weighted by how much contrast passes through each path.

In other words, the system’s output is a convolution of the injected input with the system’s impulse response.
This illustrates exactly why convolution is so important in medical imaging:it helps us model and interpret how signals — like contrast or radiation — travel through complex biological systems,and how we capture those signals with imaging devices like a gamma camera.
