Case 3: When t is between 0 and 2
In this case, the flipped and shifted version of g, that is, g of t minus tau,completely overlaps the triangular function f of tau.
This means we integrate across the entire support of f of tau,from tau equals 0 to 2.
Within this interval:
f of tau equals negative tau plus 2
g of t minus tau is constant at 3
So the convolution becomes:y of t equals the integral from 0 to 2 of 3 times (–tau + 2), d tau
When we evaluate this, we get:y of t equals 6
So, for t between 0 and 2, the convolution gives a flat region with a constant value of 6.This happens because the area under the product is the same across the entire interval.

 Case 4: When t is between 2 and 4
Now, f of tau begins to slide out of the rectangular window of g of t minus tau.
We’re back to a partial overlap, but this time on the opposite side —the right edge of g is moving past f.
The new overlapping interval runs fromtau equals t minus 2 to tau equals 2
Again, we use:
f of tau equals negative tau plus 2
g of t minus tau equals 3
So the convolution becomes:y of t equals the integral from t minus 2 to 2 of 3 times (–tau + 2), d tau
Evaluating this gives:y of t equals three-halves t squared minus twelve t plus 24
This result traces out the descending part of the convolution curve,as the overlap shrinks toward zero.

 Case 5: When t is greater than or equal to 4
At this point, g of t minus tau has completely moved past f of tau.
There is no overlap between the two functions,so the convolution result once again becomes:y of t equals 0
