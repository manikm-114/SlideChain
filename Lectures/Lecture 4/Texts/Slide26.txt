Let’s assign specific numbers to this example.
Suppose on your left hand, your thumb has value 5, your index finger is 4,then 3, 2, and 1 for the middle, ring, and little fingers.
On your right hand, the values go the other way — your little finger is 1, ring finger is 2,and it increases up to 5 at the thumb.
Now, flip the right hand — just like we flip h of n in the convolution process —then slide it across the left hand, computing the pairwise products at each shift,and summing them to get each value of the output.
This is exactly what’s happening in the MATLAB code shown on the slide.
We define x as the vector [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]and h as [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
Then we call y equals conv of x and hand finally, we plot the result.
The plot shows a symmetric peak, just as we expect — the center point reflects full overlap between the two sequences,and the values decrease symmetrically as they slide past each other.
Also remember: when you convolve two sequences of lengths n 1 and n 2,the result will have a length of n 1 plus n 1 minus one.
Practicing with simple examples like this helps you visualize and internalize the convolution process —flipping, shifting, multiplying, and adding.
And in imaging systems, which are designed to be linear and shift-invariant,convolution defines how the system responds to any input.
That’s why mastering this operation is essential.
