We can even prove these properties. I won’t go through the full proof now, but it follows directly from how convolution is defined.

Here, we start with the standard convolution definition:y of n equals the sum over k of x of k times h of n minus k.
By substituting k equals n minus capital K,we change the index of summation and rewrite the expression in reversed order.
This leads directly to:h convolved with x equals x convolved with h.
So, convolution is commutative — just like multiplication.
