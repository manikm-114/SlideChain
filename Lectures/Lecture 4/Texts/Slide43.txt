Let’s take a closer look at the graphical differences between convolution, cross-correlation, and autocorrelation.
On the left, we see convolution.Function f is in blue, and function g is in red.In convolution, g is first flipped horizontally, then shifted, multiplied with f, and finally integrated or summed.As g slides across f, the overlapping area is computed at each step — producing the black output curve below.
In the middle, we have cross-correlation.It follows the same steps as convolution, except there’s no flipping of g.We simply shift g across f, multiply at each point, and accumulate the result.So visually, the shapes are the same, but the symmetry is different — this matters in pattern alignment and signal comparison.
On the right, we see autocorrelation.This is a special case of cross-correlation where the same function is compared with itself.So g and f are the same, and we measure how well the signal matches its own shifted versions.The result usually peaks at zero shift — showing maximum similarity with itself — and falls off on either side.
