Now that you understand how 1D convolution works,it’s actually quite easy to extend the idea to two dimensions, especially when working with images.

In 2D convolution, you’re essentially applying the same process —but now, instead of just one variable like t, you’re working with two:x and y in the discrete case, or tau one and tau two in the continuous case.

Let’s take a look at the discrete form first.
We can see the formula at the top of the slide:
f of x, y convolved with g of x, y equals the double sumover n 1 and n 2 of f at n 1, n 2 times g at x minus n 1, y minus n 1.
Just like in 1D, we flip the kernel, shift it, multiply, and sum —but now we do this across both rows and columns.
In the continuous case, we do the same thing using integrals.We integrate over both variables — tau one and tau two —to compute the total area under the product.

So the core principle stays the same:Flip, shift, multiply, and sum or integrate —but now it happens in two directions at once, across a 2D grid or surface.
This extension is especially important in image processing and medical imaging,where we often apply filters, masks, or system responses across 2D signals like slices or projection data.
Whether you’re summing or integrating,convolution gives you a systematic way to model how a signal transforms when passed through a system.
