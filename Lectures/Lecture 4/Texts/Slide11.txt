Let’s take a moment to reflect on why the limiting process is essential when defining an impulse.
You might wonder — if we already know an impulse gives us the desired effect, like setting a golf ball in motion, why go through the trouble of idealizing it mathematically? The reason lies in precision. By applying the limiting process, we create a perfect, universal model of an impulse, one that’s as rigorous as the definition of a derivative in calculus.
Think of how we define a derivative: we take a small change, and by letting that change approach zero, we achieve an exact result. We’re doing something similar here with the Dirac delta function.

Now, regarding the shape of the delta function — does it matter? In fact, no. What matters is the area under the curve, not how the curve looks. It’s like receiving payment: whether it comes in one sum or in smaller installments, the total value is what counts.

Interestingly, if you start worrying about the exact shape without measuring it, you’re in uncertain territory. Without measurement, all shapes are possible — a bit like the probabilistic world of quantum mechanics! Only when we observe or measure do we know what’s truly there. This connection offers a fascinating lens on how we idealize and model impulses in system theory.
