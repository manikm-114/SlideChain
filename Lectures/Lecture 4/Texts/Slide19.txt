So far, we’ve explored both the continuous and discrete versions of the delta function.
Both approaches give us ways to express functions as combinations of basic building blocks.
Whether a system or phenomenon is fundamentally continuous or discrete isn’t always clear — think of water.
When you see a flowing stream, it seems continuous. But if you zoom in, you’ll find discrete molecules.And if you go even deeper, those molecules follow the rules of quantum mechanics, where a continuous probability wave describes behavior.

In engineering, we switch between these views depending on what’s useful.A summation represents the discrete case. An integral represents the continuous case.They are really two sides of the same coin.
With this foundation, we’re ready to move forward —and explore how delta functions connect directly to shift-invariant systems,which play a key role in imaging and signal processing.
