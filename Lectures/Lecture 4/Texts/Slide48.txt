To sum up:We explored linear systems, especially shift-invariant systems.We saw how convolution helps compute the system output.We saw how cross-correlation relates to convolution and supports feature detection.
We learned how decomposing functions into impulses connects to these operations.
Convolution can feel tricky at first, but with practice, it becomes a powerful, intuitive tool.
