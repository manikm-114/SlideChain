Let’s look at how impulse relates to momentum — a key concept in both physics and system analysis.
Momentum, as you may recall, is simply mass multiplied by velocity. 

So if an object is at rest, it has zero momentum. When you apply a force over a period of time — say, when you hit a tennis ball with a racket — the object gains velocity. That change in velocity reflects a change in momentum.

Now here’s the essential link:Impulse is defined as force multiplied by the time over which it acts.
We start with Newton’s second law, which tells us:Force equals mass times acceleration — or simply,F equals m a.

Now, acceleration is defined as the change in velocity divided by the change in time — so we write:a equals delta v over delta t.

If we substitute that into Newton’s law, we get:F times delta t equals m times delta v.

This equation shows us something powerful:Impulse — that’s force times time — equals the change in momentum.
tells us that impulse causes the change in momentum.


 It’s the way to model how mechanical systems respond to external inputs, and the idea applies to other input-output relationships as well.
