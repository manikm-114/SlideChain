You might not fully grasp this yet — and that’s perfectly fine.
Once we cover Fourier analysis, the connection between convolution and deconvolution will become much clearer.
For now, think of convolution and deconvolution as the advanced forms of multiplication and division,just like integration is the continuous counterpart of summation.
