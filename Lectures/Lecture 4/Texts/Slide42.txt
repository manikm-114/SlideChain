A related concept to convolution is cross-correlation.
Mathematically, the key difference is in the sign of the shift.
In convolution, we compute the integral of f of x minus u times g of u.
In cross-correlation, it’s f of x plus u times g of u.
So, convolution flips one of the functions before shifting and multiplying,while cross-correlation does not.
Both are useful in signal processing —but for different purposes, like system response versus pattern matching.
