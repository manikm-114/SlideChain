Here’s the idea in action.
This slide shows how inverse filtering works in the frequency domain.
A sharp image, when convolved with a point spread function, results in a blurred image.
In the Fourier domain, convolution becomes multiplication.So, the Fourier transform of the blurred image equalsthe product of the transforms of the original image and the PSF.
To reverse this, we perform division in the frequency domain —this is the essence of inverse filtering.
In the red box below, the image on the right is the transform of the blurred image,the center is the transform of the PSF,and the left is the result of dividing them — recovering the original image spectrum.
Applying the inverse Fourier transform brings us back to the spatial domain.
This process forms the basis of many image restoration techniques.
