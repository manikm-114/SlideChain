Returning to one-dimensional signals, convolution behaves like multiplication in several key ways:
Commutative: h convolved with f equals f convolved with h.
Associative: h convolved with the result of f convolved with g equals the result of h convolved with f, then convolved with g.
Distributive: h convolved with the sum of f and g equals h convolved with f plus h convolved with g.
These properties show that convolution is algebraically structured, and they will connect directly to Fourier analysis.
You’re invited to try a quick quiz:If y of n equals h of n convolved with x of n,prove that y of n minus k equals h of n convolved with x of n minus k.
This follows naturally from the meaning of convolution.
