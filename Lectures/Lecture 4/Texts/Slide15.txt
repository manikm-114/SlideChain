Let’s now think about how this idea translates to the discrete case.
You can visualize a discrete function as a collection of rectangular bars — sometimes called gate functions. These bars represent values at specific, evenly spaced points — like sampling a continuous function at fixed intervals.
Here you can see the mathematical expression in this slide.

This function is defined piecewise as follows:
It equals zero when the absolute value of t is greater than one-half,
It equals one-half when the absolute value of t is exactly one-half,
And it equals one when the absolute value of t is less than one-half.
In other words, the rectangular function is centered at zero, has a total width of one, and represents a simple, finite pulse — like a short “on” signal.

At the bottom of the slide, we define the discrete delta function, written as delta of n.
It equals one when n is zero, and zero otherwise.
So delta of n is a single spike located at n equals zero.If we shift it, like delta of n minus two, the spike moves to n equals two.

This function serves as the discrete version of the continuous delta function. By shifting and scaling these unit impulses, we can represent any discrete signal as a sum of these basic components — just like reconstructing a picture with pixels.
