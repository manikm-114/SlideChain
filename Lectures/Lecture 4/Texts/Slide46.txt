Let’s take a look at how convolution helps with feature extraction — especially edge detection — which is fundamental in medical imaging and computer vision.
In this example, we’re applying a Sobel filter, often used to detect edges in the horizontal direction.
We begin with the source image, represented as a grid of pixel intensity values.The Sobel kernel, shown here as a 3-by-3 matrix, contains weights:negative one, zero, and positive one across columns — designed to emphasize horizontal changes.
Here’s what happens:We align the filter over a 3-by-3 region of the input image.Then, we compute the sum of products between the kernel weights and the underlying pixel values.
For instance, at this highlighted region, the computation looks like this:
 –1 times 3, plus 0 times 0, plus 1 times 1, plus –2 times 2, plus 0 times 6, plus 2 times 2, plus –1 times 2, plus 0 times 4, plus 1 times 1.
When we add those up, we get –3.That value becomes the output for the corresponding destination pixel.
Now, as the filter slides across the image — pixel by pixel — this process repeats.Wherever there’s a strong horizontal transition, the filter produces a large response.Where the region is uniform, the response is small or zero.
This is how edge detection works:It uses convolution to detect where intensity changes rapidly, allowing us to extract important structural features from an image.
