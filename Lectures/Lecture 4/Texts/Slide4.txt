Let’s refresh our picture of a linear, shift-invariant system.
Imagine dropping a pebble into a still pond. No matter where the pebble lands, the ripples that form spread out in the same circular pattern. This uniformity — where the system’s response doesn’t change based on where the input occurs — is what we call shift-invariance.

Now, relate this to medical imaging. Suppose you undergo a scan at one hospital today and another hospital next week. If your physiological condition hasn’t changed, you’d expect the scans to look the same. That’s shift-invariance in action — it ensures reliability across time and space.

Next, we have linearity. It has two key components:
Additivity — if two features exist, like two separate tumors, the system should show the combination of both clearly.
Homogeneity — if a feature changes in intensity, like a tumor growing larger, the imaging should reflect that change proportionally.

Together, these properties form what’s known as the superposition principle — the foundation for much of modern system analysis, including medical imaging.
So, as we move ahead, keep the ripple analogy in mind. It's a simple yet powerful way to visualize how linear, shift-invariant systems behave — consistently, predictably, and truthfully.
