Now it’s time to apply what we’ve learned.
Suppose the time constant RC equals 1 second. Use MATLAB to generate the plots shown in the first row.
Your goal is to compute the convolution of the input signal with the system’s impulse response:
 h of t equals R C times e to the power of minus t over R C, multiplied by the unit step function
Focus on how the input signal and the impulse response interact to produce the output.
