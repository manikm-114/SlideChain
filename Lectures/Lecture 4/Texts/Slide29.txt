Now, let’s work through a more abstract — and slightly more mathematical — example.I like to call this a minds-on example.
This example is based on continuous convolution, and while it’s not difficult, it does require you to think like in calculus.
So let’s take our time with it.
With convolution, the basic process is this:We flip one function, shift it, multiply them point by point, and then integrate over the region where they overlap.
At first, that might sound a little mechanical. So let’s break it down clearly, step by step.
We’re working with two functions here:
f of t, shown in red. This is a triangular function — it starts at zero, rises to a peak at t equals 2, and then drops back to zero.
g of t, shown in purple. This is a rectangular pulse that spans from t equals minus 2 to plus 2, with a constant value of 3.
Now, because g of t is symmetric, flipping it across the vertical axis doesn’t change its shape —which actually makes our job easier.
So we’ll flip g to get g of t minus tau, and then slide it across f of tau,evaluating the convolution at each position t.
Here’s the key part:Both functions are compactly supported, meaning they’re only non-zero over a specific range.That means the overlap only happens during certain intervals.
So to compute the convolution, we’ll handle it case by case — based on the value of t.
