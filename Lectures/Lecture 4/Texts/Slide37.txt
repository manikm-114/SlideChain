Now let’s talk about the reverse process of blurring — a technique called deconvolution.
When an image is blurred, it’s often because the original scene has been convolved with a point spread function — or PSF.We saw earlier that even a perfect point source becomes a blurred spot due to system limitations.
Deconvolution is the process of trying to undo that effect —to recover the original image from its blurred version.
You can think of convolution like a kind of advanced multiplication:we blend the signal with the system’s response.In that same spirit, deconvolution behaves like an advanced form of division —we’re trying to undo the blending, and isolate the original input.
We can see that clearly in the example on this slide.The left image is a blurred photo of a car — the license plate is unreadable.After deconvolution, the right image restores the clarity — now we can read the plate.
This kind of technique is used not just in photography, but in microscopy, astronomy, and especially in medical imaging,where resolving fine detail can be critical.
It’s important to note that deconvolution is not always perfect —in real-world systems, noise and distortion make it a challenging problem.But with good modeling of the PSF and proper regularization,we can often greatly enhance image quality.
