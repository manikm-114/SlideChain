So whether we’re dealing with discrete or continuous systems,Convolution is the tool we use to compute the output.
In both cases, the idea is the same:

First, express the input as a collection of impulses.Then, for each impulse, you already know the output — that's the impulse response.Finally, sum or integrate all of those individual responses to get the final output.
This process is captured using these two key equations:
We can see here discrete and continuous mathematical formulations.
But I know from experience that convolution can feel confusing at first.That’s why it really helps to look at a concrete example.
Let’s move on to one now.
