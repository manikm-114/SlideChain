Building on what we just discussed, here we observe something quite elegant:
The shape of the force curve — whether it’s a tall narrow spike or a wide shallow push — doesn’t actually matter when it comes to total impulse. What truly matters is the area under the force-time curve.

This area represents the cumulative effect of the force. So, a small force applied over a long duration can have the same impulse as a large force applied for a short time.

In system terms, different kinds of inputs can result in the same response if their total impact — the area — is identical.
This idea is central to convolution: we’re not just tracking individual values, but the accumulated effect of an input across time.
