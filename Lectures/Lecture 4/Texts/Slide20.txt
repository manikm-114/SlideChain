Let’s take a look at this graph.
This impulse response, shown here as h of n, is our key piece of knowledge.
I’m not asking you to start from nothing.I’m giving you the system’s reaction to a standardized input — the delta function applied at time zero.
Once you have that, you’re ready.
Because if I give the system a more general input — not just a single impulse, but any arbitrary shape —you can still figure out the output.
So the question becomes:How do you compute the output from this known impulse response and a general input?
That’s exactly where convolution comes in.
Convolution is the operation that combines the input signal with the impulse response,to produce the final output.
It’s absolutely essential in imaging and signal processing.
