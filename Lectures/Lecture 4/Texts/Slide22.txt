To be specific, now let’s see how we actually compute the output y of n of a shift-invariant linear system to an arbitrary input x of n, formulated on the 1st line.
Suppose I give you a system characterized by its impulse response, written as h of n, which is shown on the 2nd line.That means: if you feed the system a discrete delta function as input, the output will be h of n.This response — h of n — is the system’s character.
But what if you give the system a more general input, say x of n?What will the output y of n be, which is what I just formulated on the 1st line, and a very important question.
Let’s break it down step by step.
Since the system is shift-invariant, if you shift the input by k, the output also shifts by k, shown on the 3rd line.So if the input is delta of n minus k, the output becomes h of n minus k.
Then, because the system is linear, if we scale the input by x of k,Consequently, the output is also scaled by x of k.That gives us x of k times h of n minus k on the 4th line.
Now, to get the total output, we add up all of these scaled and shifted responses.
Mathematically, this gives us the convolution sum, on the right-hand side of the last two lines:
y of n equals the sum over k from minus infinity to infinity of x of k times h of n minus k.
This is how the convolution is defined, and also why we need this concept.
It shows why the impulse response is so powerful — it’s all you need to compute the system’s output for any input.
Now, convolution might seem a bit tricky at first, especially because of the flipping and shifting involved —that negative k inside h of n minus k could appear confusing.
But if you follow the logic step-by-step, the structure becomes clear.
This convolution concept is fundamental in linear systems and engineering —and that’s why we dedicate so much attention to understanding convolution.
