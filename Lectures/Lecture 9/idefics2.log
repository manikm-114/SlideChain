Chat templates should be in a 'chat_template.jinja' file but found key='chat_template' in the processor's config. Make sure to move your template to its own file.
Using a slow image processor as `use_fast` is unset and a slow processor was saved with this model. `use_fast=True` will be the default behavior in v4.52, even if the model was saved with a slow processor. This will result in minor differences in outputs. You'll still be able to use a slow processor with `use_fast=False`.
