Now, let’s look at the spectrum of our synthetic signal without applying any zero-padding.

We perform the Fourier transform of our signal using the FFT function. This gives us the discrete frequency components of the signal. Then, we plot the magnitude of the FFT against frequency, with frequency in hertz along the horizontal axis.
From the plot, we can clearly see a sharp spike at one hundred hertz. That spike corresponds exactly to the first or cosine component we built into the signal.

But notice something important — the second or sine component, at two hundred two point five hertz, does not appear as a clear spike. Instead, it’s blurred and not well-resolved. This happens because two hundred two point five hertz is not exactly aligned with one of the FFT’s default spectral bins, which are spaced one hertz apart.

So, without zero-padding, the FFT resolution is limited by the number of samples we have. The first frequency happens to align perfectly with a bin, so it looks sharp. The second one falls between bins, so its energy is spread out over multiple points in the plot, making it appear a bit blurry and less distinct.
We’ll see in the next slide how zero-padding helps us refine the spectral bins and make that second frequency stand out much more clearly.
