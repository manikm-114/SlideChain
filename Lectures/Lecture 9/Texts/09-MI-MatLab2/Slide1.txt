Hello, everyone.Let’s take a few minutes before we dive into today’s MATLAB tutorial to connect what we’ve learned so far.
Over the past lectures, we’ve covered some very important foundations — linear systems, convolution, the delta function, Fourier series, Fourier transforms, and the sampling theorem. These ideas are deeply connected, and if you understand them well, everything that follows will be much easier. If you are still unsure about any of these topics, now is a great time to go back and review.
