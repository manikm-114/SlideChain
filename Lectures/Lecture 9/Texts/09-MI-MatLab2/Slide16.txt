Let’s start our spectral analysis with a simple but quite subtle example.

We’ll create a signal that contains two different pure tones — one at one hundred hertz and the other at two hundred two point five hertz.
In MATLAB, we first set the sampling frequency, F s, to one thousand hertz. That means we take one thousand samples every second.
Next, we create the time vector, t. It starts at zero seconds and increases in steps of zero, zero point zero zero one seconds — that’s one millisecond — until just before one second.

Now, our signal x is built by adding two parts:
First, a cosine wave with frequency one hundred hertz. In MATLAB, that’s written as: cosine of open parenthesis two times pi times one hundred times t close parenthesis.
Second, a sine wave with frequency two hundred two point five hertz. In MATLAB, that’s: sine of open parenthesis two times pi times two hundred two point five times t close parenthesis.
When we add these two waveforms together, we get x, which contains both frequencies.

If we plot only the first one hundred samples, we can see the combined oscillations. Sometimes the waves reinforce each other, producing larger peaks; other times they partially cancel out, making smaller peaks.
This is the time-domain view. Next, we’ll use the Fourier transform to find these frequencies in the frequency domain — and then we’ll explore how zero-padding can help us make those frequencies stand out more clearly.  It takes some effort to appreciate the benefit of zero-padding!
