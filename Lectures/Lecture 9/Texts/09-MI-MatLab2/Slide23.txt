So far, we’ve looked at the Fourier transform in one dimension — signals that vary with time. But Fourier analysis is just as powerful in two dimensions, and that’s exactly what we need for image processing.

In the context of images, the two dimensions are the horizontal and vertical spatial coordinates, rather than time. Just as a one-dimensional Fourier transform tells us what frequencies are present in a signal, a two-dimensional Fourier transform tells us what spatial frequencies are present in an image.

This is a critical tool in image analysis, because many image processing tasks — such as noise removal or edge enhancement — are easier to understand and perform in the frequency domain.
In the next slides, we’ll see how 2D Fourier transforms can be applied to filtering images, starting with noise removal and then moving on to edge enhancement.
