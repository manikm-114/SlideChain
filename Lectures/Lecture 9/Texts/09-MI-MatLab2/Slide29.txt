That brings us to the end of today’s lecture.

We’ve covered quite a lot — from discrete convolution and zero-padding, to spectral analysis, bin refinement, and practical applications in two-dimensional image filtering. I hope you now have a clearer picture of how these concepts connect and how they are applied in real-world signal and image processing.

Take some time to review the examples and try the MATLAB code on your own. Seeing the results firsthand will help solidify your understanding.
Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to seeing you in the next lecture.
