Here we see the concept of the two-dimensional Fourier transform.

The equations at the top describe two processes:
The forward 2D Fourier transform, which takes a spatial-domain function — something that varies in the x and y directions — and expresses it in terms of its spatial frequency components.
The inverse 2D Fourier transform takes that frequency-domain representation and reconstructs the original spatial-domain function.

In our example, the starting function is shown as a sideways rectangle in the spatial domain. When we perform the 2D Fourier transform, we obtain a frequency-domain representation — shown here in the rainbow-colored plot. The colors represent the amplitude of different spatial frequency components, and the values can be complex, with both real and imaginary parts.
Just as in the one-dimensional case, the Fourier transform lets us switch back and forth between two perspectives:
In the spatial domain, we see shapes and patterns directly.

In the frequency domain, we see how much of each spatial frequency is present in the image.
Understanding this relationship is essential for image processing, because many operations — such as filtering, noise removal, and edge detection — can be performed more effectively in the frequency domain.
