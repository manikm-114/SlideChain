From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere’s a simple MATLAB example you can try for yourself.\n\nWe start by defining two discrete signals — or vectors in MATLAB — x and h. In this case:\u000bx equals 5,4,3,2,1\u000bh equals 1,2,3,4,5\nNext, we perform a convolution using MATLAB’s built-in conv function:\u000by equals conv x, h;\nFinally, we plot the result:\u000bplot y; ylim 0 to 100;\n\nWhat do we see? A clean triangular shape. This is exactly what we expect when we linearly convolve two finite sequences that look like ramps in opposite directions. The convolution produces a sequence that starts small, rises to a peak — here at the center — and then falls symmetrically.\nThis simple example is a good reminder that convolution is not mysterious. It’s just a systematic way of multiplying and summing overlapping parts of two signals. And MATLAB makes it easy to visualize.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
