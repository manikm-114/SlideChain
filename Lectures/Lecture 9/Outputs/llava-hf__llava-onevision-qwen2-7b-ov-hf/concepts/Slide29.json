From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThat brings us to the end of today’s lecture.\n\nWe’ve covered quite a lot — from discrete convolution and zero-padding, to spectral analysis, bin refinement, and practical applications in two-dimensional image filtering. I hope you now have a clearer picture of how these concepts connect and how they are applied in real-world signal and image processing.\n\nTake some time to review the examples and try the MATLAB code on your own. Seeing the results firsthand will help solidify your understanding.\nThank you for your attention, and I look forward to seeing you in the next lecture.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"discrete convolution\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"zero-padding\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"spectral analysis\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"bin refinement\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"two-dimensional image filtering\", \"category\": \"image_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"MATLAB\", \"category\": \"software\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"We’ve covered quite a lot — from discrete convolution and zero-padding, to spectral analysis, bin refinement, and practical applications in two-dimensional image filtering.\"]\n}\n```",
