From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet me give you a quick roadmap for today’s session.\n\nWe’ll begin with discrete convolution. This is simply the convolution operation applied to signals that are already in discrete form — sequences of numbers rather than continuous waveforms. We’ll explore how to compute it, and why sometimes we add extra zeros at the ends of our signals — a technique called zero-padding. We’ll also see the idea of circular convolution, and how it relates to regular, or linear, convolution.\nNext, we’ll move into spectral analysis. This is one of the most common applications of Fourier analysis. Here again, zero-padding plays an important role — but now it’s in the frequency domain. We’ll also talk about refined spectral bins, which allow us to see frequency details more clearly.\n\nFinally, we’ll take what we’ve learned and apply it to two-dimensional filtering for images. Using the Fourier transform, we’ll perform noise removal to clean up an image, and edge enhancement to bring out important structures.\nSo, in short — discrete convolution, spectral analysis, and 2D image filtering. We’ll work through these step by step, connecting the math to hands-on MATLAB demonstrations.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
