Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThat brings us to the end of today’s lecture.\n\nWe’ve covered quite a lot — from discrete convolution and zero-padding, to spectral analysis, bin refinement, and practical applications in two-dimensional image filtering. I hope you now have a clearer picture of how these concepts connect and how they are applied in real-world signal and image processing.\n\nTake some time to review the examples and try the MATLAB code on your own. Seeing the results firsthand will help solidify your understanding.\nThank you for your attention, and I look forward to seeing you in the next lecture.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"convolution\", \"p\":\"uses\", \"o\":\"zero-padding\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"That brings us to the end of today’s lecture.
