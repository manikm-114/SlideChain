  "raw_output": "user \nSystem:\nYou are extracting factual relations from a medical imaging lecture. Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere’s a simple MATLAB example you can try for yourself.\n\nWe start by defining two discrete signals — or vectors in MATLAB — x and h. In this case:\u000bx equals 5,4,3,2,1\u000bh equals 1,2,3,4,5\nNext, we perform a convolution using MATLAB’s built-in conv function:\u000by equals conv x, h;\nFinally, we plot the result:\u000bplot y; ylim 0 to 100;\n\nWhat do we see? A clean triangular shape. This is exactly what we expect when we linearly convolve two finite sequences that look like ramps in opposite directions. The convolution produces a sequence that starts small, rises to a peak — here at the center — and then falls symmetrically.\nThis simple example is a good reminder that convolution is not mysterious. It’s just a systematic way of multiplying and summing overlapping parts of two signals. And MATLAB makes it easy to visualize.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"MATLAB\", \"p\":\"uses\", \"o\":\"convolution\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"MATLAB makes it easy to visualize.\"}\n  ]\n}",
