Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet me give you a quick roadmap for today’s session.\n\nWe’ll begin with discrete convolution. This is simply the convolution operation applied to signals that are already in discrete form — sequences of numbers rather than continuous waveforms. We’ll explore how to compute it, and why sometimes we add extra zeros at the ends of our signals — a technique called zero-padding. We’ll also see the idea of circular convolution, and how it relates to regular, or linear, convolution.\nNext, we’ll move into spectral analysis. This is one of the most common applications of Fourier analysis. Here again, zero-padding plays an important role — but now it’s in the frequency domain. We’ll also talk about refined spectral bins, which allow us to see frequency details more clearly.\n\nFinally, we’ll take what we’ve learned and apply it to two-dimensional filtering for images. Using the Fourier transform, we’ll perform noise removal to clean up an image, and edge enhancement to bring out important structures.\nSo, in short — discrete convolution, spectral analysis, and 2D image filtering. We’ll work through these step by step, connecting the math to hands-on MATLAB demonstrations.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"discrete convolution\", \"p\":\"uses\", \"o\":\"zero-padding\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.9, \"evidence\":\"We’ll explore how to compute it, and why sometimes we add extra zeros at the ends of our signals — a technique called zero-padding.\"}\n  ]\n}",
