Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHello, everyone.\u000bLet’s take a few minutes before we dive into today’s MATLAB tutorial to connect what we’ve learned so far.\nOver the past lectures, we’ve covered some very important foundations — linear systems, convolution, the delta function, Fourier series, Fourier transforms, and the sampling theorem. These ideas are deeply connected, and if you understand them well, everything that follows will be much easier. If you are still unsure about any of these topics, now is a great time to go back and review.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"linear systems\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"Fourier series\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"These ideas are deeply connected, and if you understand them well, everything that follows will be much easier.\"}\n  ]\n}",
