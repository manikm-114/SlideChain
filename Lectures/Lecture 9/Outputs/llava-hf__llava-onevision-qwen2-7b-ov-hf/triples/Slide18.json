Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s see what happens when we add zero-padding before taking the Fourier transform.\n\nThis time, when we call the FFT function, we specify a length of two thousand. That means we take our original signal and append enough zeros to make it two thousand points long before computing the FFT.\nBy doing this, we change the spacing between frequency bins. Previously, without padding, the bins were one hertz apart. Now, the bin spacing is F s divided by two thousand, which equals zero point five hertz. This finer spacing allows us to more accurately pinpoint frequencies that fall between the old one-hertz bins.\n\nWhen we plot the result, we still see the sharp spike at one hundred hertz. Also, we now see a very clear spike at two hundred two point five hertz — the second frequency in our original signal.\nThe reason is simple: with zero-padding, we’ve increased the frequency resolution of the spectrum, making it possible to distinguish both components of our signal cleanly.\n\nSo, zero-padding doesn’t create new information — it simply lets us view the spectrum at a finer scale, revealing details that would otherwise be hidden between coarse frequency bins.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"zero-padding\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"FFT function\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"This time, when we call the FFT function, we specify a length of two thousand.
