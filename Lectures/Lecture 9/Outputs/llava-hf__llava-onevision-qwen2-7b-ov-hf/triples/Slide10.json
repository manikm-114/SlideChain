Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s think about circular convolution.\n\nEarlier, with linear convolution, we had just one pair of signals sliding past each other. In this hand analogy, that meant one top hand and one bottom hand.\n\nHere, with circular convolution, the situation is different. The signal is treated as if it repeats periodically — just like in our earlier example from Wikipedia. So instead of one top hand, we now have several copies in a row, as shown here with three hands.\nWhen we slide the lower signal, we can’t “run out” of data on either end, because the pattern simply wraps around. That means parts of the signal from the end overlap with parts from the beginning.\n\nIn the picture, you can see that the fingers from the lower hands are overlapping with the fingers from the upper hands — not just in the middle, but also across the boundaries. This wrapping-around effect is exactly what creates the edge overlaps we saw earlier.\nIf we don’t want those overlaps to distort our result, we need to use zero-padding before performing the convolution. That’s the key difference between the clean linear convolution result and the wrapped-around circular convolution result.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"convolution\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"zero-padding\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"That’s the key difference between the clean linear convolution result and the wrapped-around circular convolution result.\"}\n  ]\n}",
