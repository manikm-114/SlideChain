Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere’s a simple, visual way to think about convolution.\u000bImagine you have two hand shapes. One is fixed, and the other is flipped and shifted.\nIn convolution, we take one function — or one signal — and flip it around, just like turning a right hand into a left hand. Then, we slide it along the other signal. At each position, we calculate how much the two shapes overlap. The amount of overlap becomes the value of the convolution at that point.\n\nThe picture here shows this idea using two hands. The vertical axis represents flipping, and the horizontal axis represents shifting. You can imagine that at certain positions, the hands align perfectly, giving a large overlap, while at other positions they hardly touch at all, giving a small or zero overlap.\n\nThis is exactly what happens in math: convolution measures the similarity between a signal and a shifted, flipped version of another signal. This idea works whether we are dealing with shapes like these hands, continuous waveforms, or sequences of numbers.\nBy keeping this visual in mind, convolution will feel much less abstract. It’s just sliding one pattern over another and measuring how well they match at each shift.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
