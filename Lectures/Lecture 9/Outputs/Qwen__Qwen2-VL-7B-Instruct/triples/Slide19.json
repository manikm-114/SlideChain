Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s look at a more complex example — a continuous signal that contains several frequency components.\n\nWe start with the same two frequencies from our earlier example: a cosine wave at one hundred hertz and a sine wave at two hundred two point five hertz.\nThen, we add three more components:\nA cosine wave at forty-five hertz\nA cosine wave at four hundred seven hertz\nAnd a sine wave at four hundred forty-five point eight hertz\n\nWhen we add all these together, we get a signal that looks quite messy in the time domain — as you can see in the plot. The rapid oscillations and varying amplitudes come from the interaction of all these frequencies.\nLooking at this time-domain plot alone, it’s not easy to tell exactly what frequencies are present or how strong they are. That’s where the Fourier transform becomes incredibly valuable — it lets us switch to the frequency domain, where each frequency component appears as a distinct peak, making the signal’s composition much clearer.\n\nIn the next step, we’ll apply the Fourier transform to this signal and see how it reveals the underlying structure that’s hidden in the time-domain view.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"Continuous Function\", \"p\":\"uses\", \"o\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"Continuous Function\"}\n  ]\n}",
