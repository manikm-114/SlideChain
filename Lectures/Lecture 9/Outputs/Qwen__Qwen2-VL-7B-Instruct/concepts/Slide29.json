From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThat brings us to the end of today’s lecture.\n\nWe’ve covered quite a lot — from discrete convolution and zero-padding, to spectral analysis, bin refinement, and practical applications in two-dimensional image filtering. I hope you now have a clearer picture of how these concepts connect and how they are applied in real-world signal and image processing.\n\nTake some time to review the examples and try the MATLAB code on your own. Seeing the results firsthand will help solidify your understanding.\nThank you for your attention, and I look forward to seeing you in the next lecture.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
