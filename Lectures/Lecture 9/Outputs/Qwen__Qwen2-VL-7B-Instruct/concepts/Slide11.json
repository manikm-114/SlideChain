From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, let’s see how zero-padding helps us fix the edge effect problem we saw with circular convolution.\n\nIn the earlier example, the red and green lines — representing the start and end of the main region we care about — were very close together. This caused the signal to wrap around and overlap in places we didn’t want.\nZero-padding means we insert extra zeros at the ends of our signals before performing the convolution. In this hand analogy, adding zero-padding is like putting some extra space between the hands. The top and bottom hands are now farther apart before they start overlapping.\n\nAs a result, the main section we care about — here marked in red — remains untouched by unwanted overlaps. The green section, which previously had interference from wrapping, now stays clean.\n\nThis is exactly how we prevent the distortion seen in the Wikipedia example: by padding with enough zeros, the circular convolution result becomes identical to the true linear convolution result.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
