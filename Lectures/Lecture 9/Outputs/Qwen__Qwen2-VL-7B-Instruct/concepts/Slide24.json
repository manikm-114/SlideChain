From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere we see the concept of the two-dimensional Fourier transform.\n\nThe equations at the top describe two processes:\nThe forward 2D Fourier transform, which takes a spatial-domain function — something that varies in the x and y directions — and expresses it in terms of its spatial frequency components.\nThe inverse 2D Fourier transform takes that frequency-domain representation and reconstructs the original spatial-domain function.\n\nIn our example, the starting function is shown as a sideways rectangle in the spatial domain. When we perform the 2D Fourier transform, we obtain a frequency-domain representation — shown here in the rainbow-colored plot. The colors represent the amplitude of different spatial frequency components, and the values can be complex, with both real and imaginary parts.\nJust as in the one-dimensional case, the Fourier transform lets us switch back and forth between two perspectives:\nIn the spatial domain, we see shapes and patterns directly.\n\nIn the frequency domain, we see how much of each spatial frequency is present in the image.\nUnderstanding this relationship is essential for image processing, because many operations — such as filtering, noise removal, and edge detection — can be performed more effectively in the frequency domain.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
