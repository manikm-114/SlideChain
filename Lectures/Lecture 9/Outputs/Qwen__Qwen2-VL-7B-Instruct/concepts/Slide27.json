From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nIn image processing, we often use specialized filters to enhance certain features or to suppress unwanted information. Here are three common examples, shown both in the spatial domain and in the frequency domain.\n\nFirst, the Unsharp Filter. Despite the name, this filter is used to sharpen images. It works by subtracting a blurred version of the image from the original, which enhances the edges. In the spatial domain, you can see the filter kernel — dark around the edges, light in the center — designed to emphasize changes in intensity.\n\nNext, the Gaussian Filter. This is a smoothing filter, which reduces noise and small details. In the spatial domain, it appears as a soft, bell-shaped pattern — bright in the middle, fading smoothly outward. Its frequency-domain representation shows that it preserves low frequencies while gradually suppressing high frequencies.\n\nFinally, the Sobel Filter. This is an edge detection filter, which highlights regions of rapid intensity change. In the spatial domain, you can see its distinctive pattern — one side light, the other dark — which responds strongly to vertical or horizontal edges depending on its orientation. In the frequency domain, its pattern reflects the fact that it suppresses low frequencies and emphasizes specific directional components.\n\nMATLAB provides built-in functions for these filters, including fspecial for 2D and fspecial3 for 3D filtering, as well as options to design your own custom kernels. By choosing the right filter and domain of application — spatial or frequency — we can control exactly what features of an image are enhanced or suppressed.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
