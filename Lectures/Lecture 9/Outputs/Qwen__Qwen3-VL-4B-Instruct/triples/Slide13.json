Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere’s where we can clearly see the difference between linear convolution and circular convolution without zero padding.\n\nIn MATLAB, we can perform circular convolution using the Fourier transform approach. First, we take the FFT of our two sequences, x and h. Then, we multiply their spectra point by point. Finally, we take the inverse FFT to bring the result back into the time domain.\nMathematically, multiplication in the frequency domain is equivalent to convolution in the time domain — but here’s the key point: if we don’t use zero-padding, the convolution we get is circular by nature.\nIn the plot below, the blue curve is the circular convolution result without zero-padding. The red dashed curve is the linear convolution result from our earlier example.\n\nNotice how the blue curve is distorted — it doesn’t match the clean triangular shape of the red curve. That distortion comes from the wrapping-around effect we talked about earlier: parts of the signal from the end are interfering with parts from the beginning.\nThis is why zero-padding is essential when we want the frequency-domain method to give the same result as linear convolution. Without it, circular convolution will give you something different.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
