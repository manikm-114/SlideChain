Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere’s a straightforward MATLAB example to show linear convolution in action.\n\nWe start with two sequences:\u000bx equals 5,4,3,2,1,0\u000bh equals 1,2,3,4,5,6\nThe first figure shows both sequences plotted together. The blue line is x — starting high and decreasing. The red line is h — starting low and increasing.\nNow we use MATLAB’s built-in conv function to compute their linear convolution:\u000blconv equals conv x, h;\n\nWhen we plot the result, we see the familiar triangular shape. It rises as the two signals increasingly overlap, reaches a peak when their centers align, and then falls as the overlap decreases.\n\nIf this feels familiar, it’s because we used the same function — conv — earlier when convolving the RC circuit’s impulse response with the unit step function in your homework. The process is exactly the same here; only the input sequences are different.\nThis example is a nice reminder that MATLAB makes it very easy to visualize convolution, and seeing the result in a plot helps reinforce what’s happening mathematically.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"s\": \"lconv = conv(x, h);\",\n      \"p\": \"produces\",\n      \"o\": \"Linear Convolution Result\",\n      \"modalities\": [\n        \"text\",\n        \"image\"\n      ],\n      \"confidence\": 0.95,\n      \"evidence\": \"When we plot the result, we see the familiar triangular shape.
