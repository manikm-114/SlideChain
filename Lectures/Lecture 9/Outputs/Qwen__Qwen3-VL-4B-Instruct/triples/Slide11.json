Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, let’s see how zero-padding helps us fix the edge effect problem we saw with circular convolution.\n\nIn the earlier example, the red and green lines — representing the start and end of the main region we care about — were very close together. This caused the signal to wrap around and overlap in places we didn’t want.\nZero-padding means we insert extra zeros at the ends of our signals before performing the convolution. In this hand analogy, adding zero-padding is like putting some extra space between the hands. The top and bottom hands are now farther apart before they start overlapping.\n\nAs a result, the main section we care about — here marked in red — remains untouched by unwanted overlaps. The green section, which previously had interference from wrapping, now stays clean.\n\nThis is exactly how we prevent the distortion seen in the Wikipedia example: by padding with enough zeros, the circular convolution result becomes identical to the true linear convolution result.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"s\": \"zero-padding\",\n      \"p\": \"uses\",\n      \"o\": \"extra zeros\",\n      \"modalities\": [\n        \"text\",\n        \"image\"\n      ],\n      \"confidence\": 0.9,\n      \"evidence\": \"Zero-padding means we insert extra zeros at the ends of our signals before performing the convolution.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"s\": \"zero-padding\",\n      \"p\": \"reconstructs_with\",\n      \"o\": \"linear convolution result\",\n      \"modalities\": [\n        \"text\",\n        \"image\"\n      ],\n      \"confidence\": 0.9,\n      \"evidence\": \"This is exactly how we prevent the distortion seen in the Wikipedia example: by padding with enough zeros, the circular convolution result becomes identical to the true linear convolution result.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"s\": \"red line\",\n      \"p\": \"represents\",\n      \"o\": \"start and end of the main region we care about\",\n      \"modalities\": [\n        \"image\"\n      ],\n      \"confidence\": 0.8,\n      \"evidence\": \"The red and green lines — representing the start and end of the main region we care",
