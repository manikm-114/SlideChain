Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow that we’ve explored convolution in detail — both in the time domain and through the FFT method — let’s move into one of the most common and powerful applications of the Fourier transform: spectral analysis.\n\nSpectral analysis is about looking at a signal in the frequency domain to see what frequencies are present and how strong they are. This is incredibly useful in engineering, science, and even everyday technology — from analyzing audio signals, to detecting features in images, to identifying patterns in biomedical data.\n\nIn the upcoming slides, we’ll take an example signal, examine its spectrum, and then see how techniques like zero-padding and refining spectral bins help us get a clearer, more detailed view of its frequency content.\nLet’s start by looking at our example signal and breaking it down step by step.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"s\": \"Spectral Analysis\",\n      \"p\": \"uses\",\n      \"o\": \"Zero-padding\",\n      \"modalities\": [\n        \"text\"\n      ],\n      \"confidence\": 0.9,\n      \"evidence\": \"In the upcoming slides, we’ll take an example signal, examine its spectrum, and then see how techniques like zero-padding and refining spectral bins help us get a clearer, more detailed view of its frequency content.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"s\": \"Spectral Analysis\",\n      \"p\": \"uses\",\n      \"o\": \"Refined Spectral Bins\",\n      \"modalities\": [\n        \"text\"\n      ],\n      \"confidence\": 0.9,\n      \"evidence\": \"In the upcoming slides, we’ll take an example signal, examine its spectrum, and then see how techniques like zero-padding and refining spectral bins help us get a clearer, more detailed view of its frequency content.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
