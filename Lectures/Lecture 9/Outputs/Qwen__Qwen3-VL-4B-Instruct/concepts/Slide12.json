From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere’s a straightforward MATLAB example to show linear convolution in action.\n\nWe start with two sequences:\u000bx equals 5,4,3,2,1,0\u000bh equals 1,2,3,4,5,6\nThe first figure shows both sequences plotted together. The blue line is x — starting high and decreasing. The red line is h — starting low and increasing.\nNow we use MATLAB’s built-in conv function to compute their linear convolution:\u000blconv equals conv x, h;\n\nWhen we plot the result, we see the familiar triangular shape. It rises as the two signals increasingly overlap, reaches a peak when their centers align, and then falls as the overlap decreases.\n\nIf this feels familiar, it’s because we used the same function — conv — earlier when convolving the RC circuit’s impulse response with the unit step function in your homework. The process is exactly the same here; only the input sequences are different.\nThis example is a nice reminder that MATLAB makes it very easy to visualize convolution, and seeing the result in a plot helps reinforce what’s happening mathematically.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
