From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere’s the spectrum of our multi-frequency signal without zero-padding and without refining the frequency bins.\n\nWhen we take the FFT and plot the magnitude against frequency in hertz, some frequencies stand out clearly, while others do not.\nLook at forty-five hertz — this is a clean, discrete value, and it aligns perfectly with an FFT bin. As a result, its spike reaches the maximum amplitude of one, just as we would expect.\nBut for the frequencies at two hundred two point five hertz and four hundred forty-five point eight hertz, things are different. Because these frequencies do not align exactly with the FFT’s default bin spacing, their energy is spread across multiple bins. This makes their peaks appear lower than one and less sharply defined.\n\nSo, without zero-padding — and therefore without finer bin spacing — our frequency resolution is limited. Frequencies that happen to fall exactly on a bin are well-resolved, but others that fall in between bins are smeared out and not as clear.\n\nNext, we’ll see how refining the bins through zero-padding improves our ability to clearly detect those non-integer frequencies.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
