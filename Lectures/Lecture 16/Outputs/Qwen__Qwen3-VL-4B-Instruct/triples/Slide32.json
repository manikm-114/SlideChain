Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere you see a graphical illustration of a modern cyclotron system. On the right is the cyclotron itself, the particle accelerator that produces the radionuclides. In the middle is the biosynthesizer, which is used to process the raw radioactive material into a usable radiotracer—such as FDG for PET imaging. On the left is the computer terminal, where the entire operation is monitored and controlled.\n\nThis layout highlights the workflow: the cyclotron generates the radionuclide, the biosynthesizer prepares it into an injectable tracer, and the computer terminal ensures that everything runs safely and precisely. Together, these components allow us to produce short-lived tracers on demand for clinical use in nuclear imaging.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\n      \"s\": \"Cyclotron\",\n      \"p\": \"produces\",\n      \"o\": \"radionuclide\",\n      \"modalities\": [\"text\", \"image\"],\n      \"confidence\": 0.9,\n      \"evidence\": \"On the right is the cyclotron itself, the particle accelerator that produces the radionuclides.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"s\": \"Biosynthesizer\",\n      \"p\": \"uses\",\n      \"o\": \"raw radioactive material\",\n      \"modalities\": [\"text\", \"image\"],\n      \"confidence\": 0.8,\n      \"evidence\": \"In the middle is the biosynthesizer, which is used to process the raw radioactive material into a usable radiotracer\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"s\": \"Computer Terminal\",\n      \"p\": \"uses\",\n      \"o\": \"entire operation\",\n      \"modalities\": [\"text\", \"image\"],\n      \"confidence\": 0.9,\n      \"evidence\": \"On the left is the computer terminal, where the entire operation is monitored and controlled.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
