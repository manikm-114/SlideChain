From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThis table lists some of the most common radioactive tracers used in nuclear medicine. Each tracer has a characteristic half-life and a specific gamma-ray energy.\n\nFor example, technetium-99m has a half-life of about six hours and emits gamma rays at 140 kilo-electronvolts, which is ideal for imaging. Gallium-67 has a longer half-life of about three days and multiple gamma energies. Thallium-201, xenon-133, indium-111, and iodine isotopes are also widely used, each with its own half-lives and energy levels.\n\nYou don’t need to memorize the details of this table. Instead, just recognize that different radionuclides are available for different imaging applications, and their properties — half-life and gamma energy — determine how and where they are best used. This is general knowledge to give you a sense of the variety of tracers available in nuclear medicine.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Reject filler or administrative text.\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\n      \"term\": \"common radioactive tracers\",\n      \"category\": \"modality\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"half-life\",\n      \"category\": \"physics\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"gamma-ray energy\",\n      \"category\": \"physics\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"technetium-99m\",\n      \"category\": \"modality\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"gallium-67\",\n      \"category\": \"modality\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"thallium-201\",\n      \"category\": \"modality\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"xenon-133\",\n      \"category\": \"modality\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"indium-111\",\n      \"category\": \"modality\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"iodine isotopes\",\n      \"category\": \"modality\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"different radionuclides are available for different imaging applications\",\n      \"category\": \"modality\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"their properties — half-life and",
