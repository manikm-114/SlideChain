From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThe fourth method of producing radionuclides, and the one most relevant to clinical imaging today, is the use of radionuclide generators.\nA very well-known example is the technetium-99m generator. This system is sometimes nicknamed the “moly cow” because it is based on the parent isotope molybdenum-99, which naturally decays to technetium-99m. Just as a cow can be “milked” repeatedly, the generator can be eluted, or “milked,” each day to obtain fresh technetium-99m for imaging.\n\nTechnetium-99m is especially important because it is the most widely used radionuclide in single photon emission computed tomography, or SPECT. It provides the right balance of half-life, about six hours, and gamma ray energy, about 140 kilo-electron volts, making it very effective for diagnostic imaging while keeping the patient dose reasonable.\n\nThis approach is extremely cost-effective compared to building a nuclear reactor or cyclotron. That is why radionuclide generators remain a backbone of nuclear medicine practice worldwide.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
