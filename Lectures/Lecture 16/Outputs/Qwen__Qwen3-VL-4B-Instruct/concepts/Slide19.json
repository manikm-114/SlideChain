From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nPositron emission is another key decay mechanism, and it is especially important for nuclear imaging.\n\nHere’s what happens: inside an unstable nucleus, a proton transforms into a neutron. In the process, the nucleus emits a positron — which is a positively charged electron — along with a neutrino. The emitted positron travels only a short distance before it encounters an electron. Because they carry opposite charges, the positron and the electron are naturally attracted to one another. When they meet, they annihilate each other. This annihilation produces two gamma photons, each with an energy of 511 kilo-electronvolts. These photons travel in opposite directions, almost exactly 180 degrees apart.\n\nThis property is the basis for positron emission tomography, or PET. By detecting pairs of gamma photons and knowing they must lie along the same line, we can reconstruct the location where the positron annihilation occurred. That gives us an image of the tracer distribution inside the body.\n\nSo, compared with alpha and beta-minus decay, positron emission is extremely valuable for imaging — it is the physical principle behind PET, one of the most important functional imaging modalities in medicine.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
