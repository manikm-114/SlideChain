From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nWelcome to Lecture 16 on Nuclear Physics.\n\nIn this course, we focus on understanding nuclear physics in the context of biomedical imaging. The key to learn this material is to go through it more than once — first by following the lecture, and then by reviewing the textbook or slides afterward. Repetition helps clarify the concepts and makes them easier to remember.\n\nNow, when you open the textbook chapter on nuclear medicine or nuclear imaging, you might feel that it contains an overwhelming amount of information. There are details about pharmaceuticals and diseases that may seem excessive. For our purpose, you don’t need to memorize those. Instead, we will focus on the physical principles, including the chemistry and instrumentation concepts, essential components, and particularly the mathematical modeling and quantitative relationships.\n\nThese are the core concepts you should master well. The clinical terms and long lists are good to know, but not our main focus.\nThroughout the slides, you’ll notice visual markers such as red diamonds or green buttons. Again, these are meant to highlight what is most important and to guide your attention to the central knowledge in this lecture.”\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
