From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThe textbook explains gamma decay in more detail, and it makes an important point: no radionuclide decays solely by gamma emission. Instead, gamma rays appear as part of a decay scheme where an intermediate state — called a metastable state — is formed.\n\nA widely used example is technetium-99m, or Tc-99m. It is produced from molybdenum-99, which undergoes beta decay. The daughter nucleus, Tc-99m, is metastable. After a half-life of about six hours, it transitions to the stable form Tc-99, releasing a gamma photon in the process.\nThe gamma photon from Tc-99m has an energy of about 140 kilo-electronvolts. This energy is ideal for nuclear medicine imaging. If the photon energy is too low, below about 100 keV, most of the photons are absorbed in tissue and never reach the detector. If the energy is too high, above about 200 keV, the photons penetrate the collimator and reduce image quality. That is why the sweet spot for imaging is between 100 and 200 keV — and Tc-99m fits perfectly in this range.\n\nThis is why Tc-99m has become the most widely used radionuclide in nuclear medicine, applied in more than 90 percent of diagnostic imaging studies. So now you’ve seen the three main decay mechanisms: alpha, beta, and gamma. In the next step, we’ll discuss the final one — electron capture.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
