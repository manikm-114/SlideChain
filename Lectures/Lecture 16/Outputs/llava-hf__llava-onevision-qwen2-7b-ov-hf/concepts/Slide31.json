From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThe third method of producing radionuclides, and one that is especially important for nuclear imaging, is the use of a cyclotron. A cyclotron is a type of particle accelerator. It works by accelerating charged particles—such as protons—outward in a spiral path under the influence of a strong magnetic field and a rapidly varying electric field.\n\nWhen these high-energy particles strike a target material, nuclear reactions occur, and radionuclides are produced. One of the most well-known examples is the production of fluorodeoxyglucose, or FDG, which is widely used in PET imaging.\nBecause PET imaging requires very short-lived tracers like fluorine-18, cyclotrons must be located relatively close to hospitals and imaging centers. This is one of the reasons PET imaging is more costly: it not only requires advanced scanners but also a dedicated cyclotron facility to generate the necessary tracers.\n\nSo, while nuclear reactors play a role in producing some radionuclides, cyclotrons are indispensable for producing the positron-emitting isotopes used in modern clinical imaging.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
