From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow we move on to the third part of our discussion — tracer production.\nSo far, we’ve gone through the general perspective, and we’ve talked about isotopes and how they decay through different mechanisms. Some of these mechanisms, like positron emission or gamma decay, produce gamma rays that we can detect for imaging purposes. We also saw how radioactive decay can be modeled mathematically. \n\nNow let’s ask the next question: how do we actually produce radioactive tracers?\nOne of the most practical, popular, and cost-effective methods is through something called a radionuclide generator. These generators are extremely important because they are the most widely used way to produce tracers for clinical nuclear medicine.\n\nThe process is often called “milking.” You’ll soon see why this analogy makes sense. We can even describe this process mathematically. It looks a bit more complicated than simple decay, but really, it’s just a system of two equations — one for the parent isotope and one for the daughter isotope. When you couple them together, you can model how tracers are produced over time.\nThat’s what we’ll explore next.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
