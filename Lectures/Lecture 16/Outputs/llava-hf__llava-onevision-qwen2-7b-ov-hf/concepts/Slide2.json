From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAs you can see from the course schedule, we are right on track. We’ve already covered the earlier topics such as introduction, system concepts, Fourier series, and signal processing. More recently, we completed modules on CT reconstruction and MATLAB applications.\n\nToday’s lecture is focusing on nuclear physics. In the next lecture, we will explain SPECT and PET imaging principles and systems. After that, we will move on to MRI, ultrasound, and optical imaging, before wrapping up the course with the final exam.\n\nSo everything is proceeding according to plan.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"Fourier series\", \"category\": \"mathematics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"signal processing\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"CT reconstruction\", \"category\": \"reconstruction\"},\n    {\"term\": \"MATLAB applications\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"nuclear physics\", \"category\": \"physics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"SPECT\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"PET imaging principles and systems\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"MRI\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"ultrasound\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"optical imaging\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"final exam\", \"category\": \"workflow\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"As you can see from the course schedule, we are right on track.
