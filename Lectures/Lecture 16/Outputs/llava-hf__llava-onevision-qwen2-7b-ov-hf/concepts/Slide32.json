From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere you see a graphical illustration of a modern cyclotron system. On the right is the cyclotron itself, the particle accelerator that produces the radionuclides. In the middle is the biosynthesizer, which is used to process the raw radioactive material into a usable radiotracer—such as FDG for PET imaging. On the left is the computer terminal, where the entire operation is monitored and controlled.\n\nThis layout highlights the workflow: the cyclotron generates the radionuclide, the biosynthesizer prepares it into an injectable tracer, and the computer terminal ensures that everything runs safely and precisely. Together, these components allow us to produce short-lived tracers on demand for clinical use in nuclear imaging.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"cyclotron\", \"category\": \"physics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"radionuclide\", \"category\": \"physics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"biosynthesizer\", \"category\": \"instrumentation\"},\n    {\"term\": \"injectable tracer\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"computer terminal\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"monitoring and control\", \"category\": \"workflow\"},\n    {\"term\": \"nuclear imaging\", \"category\": \"modality\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"This layout highlights the workflow: the cyclotron generates the radionuclide, the biosynthesizer prepares it into an injectable tracer, and the computer terminal ensures that everything runs safely and precisely.
