From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet us now look more carefully at how the technetium generator actually works. This system operates through a two-step process.\n\nThe parent isotope is molybdenum-99, which is prepared and loaded into an alumina column inside the generator. This column is shielded with lead for safety. Over time, molybdenum-99 naturally decays to technetium-99m, the daughter isotope. Technetium-99m, however, binds only weakly to the alumina column. That means if we pass a saline solution through the column, it will wash the technetium-99m out, while leaving the molybdenum-99 behind. This daily washing process is often called “milking” the generator, just like milking a cow. Each elution provides a fresh supply of technetium-99m for clinical use.\n\nOnce obtained, the technetium-99m is injected into the patient’s body. Inside the body, it undergoes further decay to technetium-99, a stable isotope. Importantly, this decay is accompanied by the emission of gamma photons, which can then be detected by imaging devices such as a gamma camera.\n\nFrom a modeling perspective, this is a two-step decay chain. The parent, molybdenum-99, decays with its own half-life to produce technetium-99m. Then technetium-99m decays with a shorter half-life into stable technetium-99, releasing gamma radiation in the process. Each of these steps follows an exponential law, and when combined, they produce a dynamic interplay between parent, daughter, and final stable product.\nThis two-step process is what makes the technetium generator so effective—it provides a steady supply of a short-lived imaging isotope without requiring a reactor or cyclotron on-site.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
