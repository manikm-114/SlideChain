From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, let’s take a closer look at how coincidence detection works in PET imaging.\nWhen a positron emitted from the tracer annihilates with an electron, the process produces two gamma photons, each with an energy of 511 kilo–electron volts, traveling in nearly opposite directions. The key is that both of these photons need to be detected at the same time to confirm a true event.\n\nHere is how the process works step by step. Each gamma photon first enters a detector crystal. Inside the crystal, the photon interacts and produces visible light, which is then amplified by a photomultiplier tube, giving us an electronic pulse. But not every pulse comes from the correct kind of photon—scattered photons, for example, may have lower energy. This is where the pulse height analyzer comes in. It checks the energy of each detected photon and only accepts those within a narrow energy window around 511 keV. This helps us reject scattered signals.\n\nNow, imagine we have two detectors on opposite sides. If one detector registers a photon and the other also registers a photon of the correct energy, and the two signals arrive within a very short time window—just a few nanoseconds apart—then the coincidence circuit recognizes them as a pair. This means they must have come from the same annihilation event along the line connecting the two detectors.\n\nSo, only when both detectors see valid 511 keV photons at nearly the same instant do we count it as a true PET event. This is what allows PET imaging to trace the exact line of response inside the body, leading to the powerful three-dimensional reconstructions that make PET such a valuable tool in clinical imaging.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
