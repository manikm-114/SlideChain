From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThis is Michael Ter-Pogossian, a very important figure in nuclear physics and especially in nuclear imaging. He is recognized as one of the pioneers of positron emission tomography, or PET, which became the first truly functional brain imaging technology.\nPET was groundbreaking because, unlike conventional CT, which shows anatomy, PET allows us to evaluate the brain in action — during mental processes. Later in this course, we will study PET in detail.\n\nI’d like to share a personal connection here. After finishing my PhD, I was hired at the Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology at Washington University in St. Louis. I started as a medical physicist, doing imaging measurements and research. The leader of our medical physics group at that time was Professor Michael Ter-Pogossian. I was still young and didn’t fully realize how great he was — I simply saw him as my immediate supervisor.\nLooking back, I recognize his remarkable contributions. Many people felt that he truly deserved a Nobel Prize for his invention of PET and his pioneering results. Unfortunately, he passed away in 1996 from heart disease. Beyond his scientific work, he was also the founding editor-in-chief of the IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, which remains the most important journal in our field.\n\nI remember him as not only brilliant but also humorous and down-to-earth. For example, he once told us that doing too much simulation is like having a simulated meal — it might look convincing, but afterward, you’re still hungry. That kind of humor made him unforgettable.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
