From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s look at the mathematical details of radioactive decay.\nThe key point is that the rate of change of the number of radioactive nuclei, which we call capital N, is proportional to how much material is still present. \n\nIn symbols, this is written as:\n“dee N by dee t equals negative lambda times N.”\nHere, lambda is called the decay constant. The negative sign simply tells us that the number is going down over time.\nIf you solve this equation, the solution is an exponential curve. It looks like this:\n“N of t equals N naught times e to the power of negative lambda times t.”\nHere, N of t is the number of nuclei at time t, and N naught is the starting number at time zero.\n\nNow, the half-life — written as t one-half — is the time it takes for the material to decay to one-half of its original amount. To find it, we set N equal to one-half of N naught in the formula. If you solve for time, you get:\n“t one-half equals natural log of two, divided by lambda.”\nSo the half-life depends only on the decay constant.\n\nBut in medicine, we also have to think about biological clearance. When we inject a radioactive tracer, the body tries to remove it — for example, through urine. That biological process also follows an exponential law, with its own half-life.\nWhen we put both processes together — the physical decay and the biological clearance — we get the effective half-life. \n\nThe formula is:\n“One over effective half-life equals one over the physical half-life plus one over the biological half-life.”\nThis is the equation you really need to remember. It tells us how long a tracer effectively stays in the body, and that is the number we use in nuclear medicine calculations.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
