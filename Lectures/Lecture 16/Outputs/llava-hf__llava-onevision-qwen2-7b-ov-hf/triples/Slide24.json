  "raw_output": "user \nSystem:\nYou are extracting factual relations from a medical imaging lecture. Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThis table lists some of the most common radioactive tracers used in nuclear medicine. Each tracer has a characteristic half-life and a specific gamma-ray energy.\n\nFor example, technetium-99m has a half-life of about six hours and emits gamma rays at 140 kilo-electronvolts, which is ideal for imaging. Gallium-67 has a longer half-life of about three days and multiple gamma energies. Thallium-201, xenon-133, indium-111, and iodine isotopes are also widely used, each with its own half-lives and energy levels.\n\nYou don’t need to memorize the details of this table. Instead, just recognize that different radionuclides are available for different imaging applications, and their properties — half-life and gamma energy — determine how and where they are best used. This is general knowledge to give you a sense of the variety of tracers available in nuclear medicine.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"technetium-99m\", \"p\":\"uses\", \"o\":\"nuclear medicine\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"Technetium-99m is ideal for imaging due to its half-life of about six hours and gamma rays at 140 kilo-electronvolts.\"}\n  ]\n}",
