Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s connect what we have learned to one of the most important applications of nuclear imaging—FDG PET for cancer imaging.\n\nPET stands for positron emission tomography. Unlike CT or MRI, which give us structural information, PET provides functional imaging. It shows us how tissues are working metabolically inside the body. The key is the tracer we use. For PET, the most widely used tracer is fluorodeoxyglucose, or FDG. This is a glucose analogue that is produced in a cyclotron. Because FDG behaves like glucose, it is taken up by tissues according to their metabolic activity. Cancer cells are often much more metabolically active than normal cells, so they absorb more FDG. When we image the concentration of FDG, we are essentially mapping the regions of high glucose metabolism. This makes PET a very powerful tool for detecting tumors and also for evaluating whether cancer has metastasized, that is, spread to other sites in the body.\n\nThe physics behind PET is tied to beta-plus decay. FDG emits a positron, which quickly encounters a nearby electron. When the positron and electron meet, they annihilate, producing a pair of gamma photons moving in nearly opposite directions. These paired photons are detected simultaneously—that’s the coincidence detection we discussed earlier.\n\nThis entire principle—positron emission, annihilation, and detection of the paired photons—forms the physical and chemical foundation of PET imaging. Today, FDG PET accounts for about 90 percent of all PET scans, highlighting just how central this method is in cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
