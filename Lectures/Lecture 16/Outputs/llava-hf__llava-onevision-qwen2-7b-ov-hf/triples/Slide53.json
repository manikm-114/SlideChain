Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, here’s another way to visualize coincidence detection. In this diagram, we see detectors arranged around the patient, with a positron annihilation event taking place inside the body. From this event, two gamma photons are emitted in nearly opposite directions.\n\nEach detector continuously records signals as a function of time. Most of the time, what you see are background signals or small pulses. But every now and then, a true gamma photon from an annihilation event strikes the detector, and this produces a sharp pulse.\nThe key idea is that we are not looking at a single detector alone. Instead, we compare signals across pairs of detectors. If detector i and detector j, located opposite one another, both register a pulse at nearly the same instant, and if both pulses have the correct energy—around 511 keV—then we know with high confidence that a true annihilation event occurred along the line connecting those two detectors.\n\nSo, the system continuously searches for these paired pulses. The electronics are designed to be fast and complex enough to check every possible detector pair in real time. Whenever a coincidence is confirmed, the system draws what we call a line of response between the two detectors. That line is where the annihilation must have taken place. \n\nThis principle—detecting paired pulses and building lines of response—is the foundation of PET imaging. By collecting many such lines from annihilations throughout the body, we can reconstruct a full three-dimensional image of tracer distribution inside the patient.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
