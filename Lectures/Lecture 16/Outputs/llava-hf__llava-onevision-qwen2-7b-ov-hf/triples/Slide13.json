Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThis slide is mainly a review of basic nuclear physics concepts: the atomic number and the mass number.\nThe atomic number, denoted by Z, is simply the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom. The mass number, usually written as A, is the total number of nucleons, meaning the number of protons plus the number of neutrons. In most cases, the atomic weight is approximately equal to this mass number.\n\nFor example, in helium, the atomic number is 2, because there are two protons. The mass number is 4, because helium has two protons and two neutrons. When an atom is neutral, the number of electrons surrounding the nucleus matches the number of protons in the nucleus. This keeps the charge balanced.\nNow, once we understand atomic number and mass number, we can define what isotopes are.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1].
