Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nEarlier, we talked about the four main mechanisms of radioactive decay: alpha decay, beta decay, gamma decay, and electron capture. Within beta decay, remember there are two types — beta minus and beta plus. And for imaging purposes, beta plus is the more important one.\nNow let’s switch perspective. Instead of asking how isotopes decay, we ask how do we produce these radioactive tracers in the first place? The good news is, this is also easy to remember — there are four basic methods.\n\nAccording to your textbook, the four ways to produce radionuclides are:\nNeutron capture.\nNuclear fission.\nCharged-particle bombardment.\nAnd the use of radionuclide generators.\n\nSo again, four mechanisms for decay, and four methods for production — a nice symmetry that helps you remember.\nAmong these, I want to highlight the fourth method — radionuclide generators — because it is the one most widely used in clinical practice. The first two methods require a nuclear reactor, and while they are very important in research and industrial production, they are not as accessible for everyday hospital use. Between those two, nuclear fission is now more popular and more cost-effective compared to neutron capture.\n\nBut for us, as medical imaging scientists and engineers, the radionuclide generator is the key player, and that’s the one we’ll explore in detail next.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
