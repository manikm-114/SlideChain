Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo that concludes the third part, where we discussed radioactivity and tracer production. We learned about the four methods of producing radionuclides, with special focus on the third and fourth methods—cyclotrons for positron emission tomography, and radionuclide generators for single photon emission tomography. Together, these methods provide the backbone of nuclear medicine.\n\nNow let’s move on to the final part of today’s lecture: data acquisition. This is where the signals generated by radioactive decay are actually detected and transformed into images. There are two main approaches we need to understand. The first is the gamma camera, which is used in single-photon emission computed tomography, or SPECT. The gamma camera captures individual gamma-ray photons one by one. The second approach is coincidence detection, which is the principle behind positron emission tomography, or PET. In this case, we don’t just detect single photons; instead, we detect pairs of photons that are emitted simultaneously, traveling in opposite directions.\n\nWhy does this happen? Because when a positron encounters an electron, the two annihilate, producing a pair of gamma photons. Detecting these pairs in coincidence allows PET to provide highly accurate information about the location of the annihilation event inside the body.\nSo, in summary, SPECT relies on detecting single photons with a gamma camera, while PET relies on detecting photon pairs through coincidence detection. This distinction has a profound effect on how scanners are designed and on the quality of the images they produce.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
