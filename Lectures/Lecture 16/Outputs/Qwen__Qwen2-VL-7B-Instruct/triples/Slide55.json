Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo, here are your exercises for this week. \n\nThese questions are designed to help you practice the core ideas we learned today: calculating radioactivity from decay counts, relating activity to half-life and the number of nuclei, analyzing how the signal-to-noise ratio changes with dose and scan time, and modeling the technetium generator with parent–daughter decay equations. You are not limited to only these four questions. If you want to challenge yourself, feel free to explore more problems in the textbook. But these are the ones that will be graded.\n\nSince this is an online course, all discussions and clarifications will happen here. If anything is unclear, simply revisit the lecture materials, the slides, or the recorded explanation—we’ll keep everything accessible for you to review at your own pace.\n\nThat brings us to the end of today’s lecture. Thank you for studying along online, and I’ll see you in the next session.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}",
