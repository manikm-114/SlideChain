Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nUp to now, we’ve said that coincidence detection tells us that an annihilation event must have occurred somewhere along the line connecting two detectors. But that’s still quite a lot of uncertainty—it could be anywhere on that line.\n\nNow, with time-of-flight detection, we can do better. The idea is straightforward: when the two gamma photons are produced, they leave the annihilation site at the same instant, traveling in opposite directions at the speed of light. If the annihilation happens exactly in the middle, the photons will reach both detectors at the same time. But if the event happens closer to one detector, the photon on that side will arrive slightly earlier.\n\nSo by measuring this tiny arrival time difference, we can estimate where along the line the event occurred. Of course, because our timing measurements are not infinitely precise, there is still some uncertainty. That’s why we don’t pinpoint a single location, but instead assign a probability distribution—centered closer to one detector or the other, depending on the measured delay. The effect is illustrated here. Without time-of-flight information, the whole line is equally likely, so the back-projected signal is spread out. With time-of-flight, the probability is concentrated in a smaller region along that line. When you combine millions of such measurements, the reconstructed PET image is sharper, with better contrast and less noise.\n\nSo the concept is simple: coincidence detection gives us the line, and time-of-flight narrows it down to a region on that line where the paired emission happened. This is why modern PET scanners increasingly use time-of-flight technology—it significantly improves image quality without requiring extra radiation dose.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
