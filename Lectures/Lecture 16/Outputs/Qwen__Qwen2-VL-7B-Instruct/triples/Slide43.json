Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nWhen I visited companies or nuclear detector vendors, they often gave me these as small souvenirs—clear blocks that look just like glass. But these aren’t ordinary glass. They are specially manufactured scintillation crystals, the heart of gamma cameras.\n\nWhat makes them remarkable is that when an invisible gamma ray photon strikes the crystal, it produces a tiny flash of visible light. In other words, they convert high-energy radiation, which our eyes cannot see, into visible photons that we can detect.\n\nIf you continuously bombard the crystal with gamma rays, you’ll see flashes of light—very faint to the naked eye, but easily measurable with sensitive detectors. This conversion process is the critical first step in turning radioactive emissions inside the body into signals that we can ultimately form into an image.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
