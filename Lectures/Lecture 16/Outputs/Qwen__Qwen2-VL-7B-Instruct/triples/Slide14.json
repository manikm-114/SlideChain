Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s talk about isotopes.\n\nIsotopes of a chemical element all share the same atomic number — meaning they have the same number of protons. But they differ in their mass numbers because the number of neutrons is different. So, isotopes are the same element, but with different neutron counts.\nInside the nucleus, protons and neutrons are held together by the strong nuclear force. When the balance between protons and neutrons is within a stable range, the nucleus remains stable. But if the configuration becomes unbalanced — for example, when there are too many neutrons or too many protons relative to each other — the nucleus can become unstable.\n\nAn unstable nucleus will eventually change into a more stable state. This happens through radioactive decay, which follows an exponential curve. We’ll explore that decay law in more detail and even derive it mathematically later on.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
