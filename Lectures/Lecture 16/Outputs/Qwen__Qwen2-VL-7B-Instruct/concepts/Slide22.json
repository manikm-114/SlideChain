From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThe final type of decay we’ll discuss is electron capture.\n\nIn electron capture, a proton in the nucleus is transformed into a neutron. This happens when the nucleus captures one of the atom’s own inner electrons, usually from the K-shell. By capturing this electron, the proton combines with it to form a neutron, and a neutrino is released.\nThe daughter nucleus is often left in an excited state. To release that excess energy, it emits X-rays or Auger electrons. In some cases, additional radiation is produced through what we call bremsstrahlung — a German word meaning “braking radiation.” This process is similar to what we studied earlier in X-ray production, where electrons slow down and emit radiation.\n\nSo, electron capture does not directly produce a particle like an alpha or a beta. Instead, it changes the balance inside the nucleus and produces photons — either X-rays or gamma rays — along with other possible emissions. This mechanism adds to the classification of decay types, and it highlights again that photons can be generated in different ways. Whether they are called X-rays or gamma rays depends not on the photon itself, but on how it was produced.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
