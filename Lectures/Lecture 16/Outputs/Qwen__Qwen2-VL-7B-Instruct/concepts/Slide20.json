From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s look at gamma decay.\n\nGamma decay occurs when a nucleus changes its internal configuration and releases the excess energy in the form of a gamma photon. This process does not change the number of protons or neutrons, so the element remains the same — only the energy state of the nucleus changes.\nThere are two main categories. The first is immediate gamma decay. In this case, the nucleus drops from a higher energy state directly to a lower state, and a gamma photon is released right away.\n\nThe second category is more common and more useful in practice. Here, the nucleus does not release the gamma photon immediately. Instead, it first enters a metastable state. After a short delay, the gamma photon is released, sometimes along with other particles such as an antineutrino.\nA classic example of this process is technetium-99m, often abbreviated as Tc-99m. The “m” stands for metastable. This isotope is widely used in nuclear medicine because of its convenient half-life and the gamma photons it emits, which are ideal for imaging.\n\nSo, gamma decay is highly relevant to nuclear imaging, especially in the form of isotopes like Tc-99m, which remains one of the most important tracers in clinical practice.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
