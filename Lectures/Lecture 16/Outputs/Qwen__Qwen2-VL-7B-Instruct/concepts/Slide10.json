From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere, we compare X-ray CT with nuclear imaging by looking at their similarities and differences.\nOn the left, you see a CT scanner and CT images. On the right is a PET scanner, which represents nuclear imaging. Although the images shown here may not be perfectly matched, the idea is clear — both modalities use radiation and produce tomographic images.\n\nLet’s begin with the similarities. \nFirst, gamma rays and X-rays have overlapping energy ranges. Their energies are high enough that, when passing through biological tissue, we can often treat them as traveling in straight lines. Of course, scattering occurs, but for image reconstruction, we assume straight-line geometry. That simplifies tomographic reconstruction.\n\nSecond, the data from both modalities can be expressed as line integrals. In CT, this is exactly the Radon transform. In nuclear imaging, it is a related but slightly different mathematical formulation. Still, both methods involve line integrals and support tomographic image reconstruction.\n\nThird, both CT and nuclear imaging generate two-dimensional slices, three-dimensional volumes, or even four-dimensional datasets when dynamics are included. So, in terms of imaging geometry and reconstruction, they share a strong common foundation.\n\nNow, let’s turn to the differences. In CT, the radiation source is external — the X-ray tube outside the patient. In nuclear imaging, the source is internal — a radioactive tracer introduced into the bloodstream. This tracer accumulates in certain regions, such as the heart or tumors, especially malignant tumors with a high blood supply.\nAnother difference is the type of information provided. CT primarily gives anatomical information — structural details of organs and tissues. Nuclear imaging, by contrast, provides functional information, showing how tissues are metabolizing or reacting biologically. This makes nuclear imaging highly complementary to CT.\nThird, there is a difference in flux and resolution. CT uses a strong external X-ray beam, producing high photon flux and therefore high-resolution images. Nuclear imaging uses only a small injected amount of tracer, so the signal is weak. The data are noisier, and the spatial resolution is lower. Nuclear images may not look as sharp as CT images.\n\nFinally, there is sensitivity. CT detects differences in tissue density, but since most tissues are made of light elements, benign and malignant tumors can appear very similar until they grow large enough to change anatomy. That means CT may detect cancer only at later stages. Nuclear imaging, however, is far more sensitive. Because the tracer accumulates in areas of abnormal metabolism, nuclear imaging can reveal very small or early-stage tumors — often before structural changes appear.\nThis sensitivity is one of the greatest strengths of nuclear imaging, making it an invaluable tool for early detection and treatment planning.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
