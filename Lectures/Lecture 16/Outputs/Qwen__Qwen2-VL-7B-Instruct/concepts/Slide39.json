From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s look more carefully at the principle of the gamma camera, which is one of the most important devices in nuclear medicine imaging. I’ve placed a red diamond here to highlight that this concept is essential.\n\nThe very first step in the system is the collimator. Without collimation, gamma photons would be arriving at the detector from all directions, and we wouldn’t know where they came from. The collimator, usually made of heavy metal such as lead, only allows photons traveling along certain directions to pass through. In this way, we can establish the line of response. Only photons traveling more or less straight along the openings are detected, while those coming from oblique angles are blocked. This is very similar in spirit to X-ray imaging, where each measurement corresponds to a line integral along a particular direction.\n\nThe choice of collimator is closely linked to photon energy. If the gamma rays have too low an energy, they will be absorbed within the body and never reach the detector. If the energy is too high, the collimator cannot stop the oblique photons, so the image contrast is lost. That is why, for clinical nuclear medicine, we typically work in the range of about 100 to 200 keV — a compromise between tissue penetration and collimator effectiveness.\n\nOnce a photon passes the collimator, it strikes the scintillation crystal. This crystal, usually sodium iodide doped with thallium, emits a flash of visible light when it absorbs a gamma photon. That flash is extremely faint, so it is coupled to photomultiplier tubes. The photomultipliers amplify the light signal into an electrical pulse.\n\nThen, through a network — sometimes called the Anger logic or Anger position circuit — the system calculates the location where the photon entered the crystal. A pulse height analyzer checks the photon’s energy, ensuring we only accept photons in the desired energy window. Finally, the computer records the position and energy, gradually building up an image of tracer distribution inside the body.\nSo the key sequence is: collimator to select direction, scintillation crystal to convert gamma to light, photomultipliers to amplify the signal, electronics to analyze energy and position, and finally the computer to assemble the image.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
