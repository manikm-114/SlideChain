From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nCT and nuclear imaging are highly complementary. CT provides detailed anatomical information, while nuclear imaging shows functional and biochemical processes. So the natural idea is — why not combine them?\nThat’s exactly what happened with the development of hybrid scanners. One of the pioneers in this effort was Simon Cherry, who helped establish PET-CT as a practical technology.\n\nThe major strength of nuclear imaging is its ability to label many types of metabolites. This makes it highly sensitive for studying biochemical and physiological processes inside the body. The limitation, of course, is that nuclear imaging by itself has relatively low resolution. That’s why it works best when combined with CT or MRI.\n\nCT or MRI gives us the anatomical background — the structural map of tissues. The nuclear tracer distribution can then be precisely superimposed on that background, maximizing the information content. This combination allows us to see both anatomy and function in perfect alignment.\nPET-CT was the first successful hybrid scanner. Today, in oncology departments, it is rare to see a stand-alone PET scanner. Almost always, PET is integrated with CT. This avoids the problems of image registration that occur when separate scanners are used. Moving the patient between machines can change posture or positioning, making alignment difficult. With a single integrated scanner, those issues are eliminated.\n\nLater, PET-MRI was also developed, bringing together molecular imaging with the excellent soft-tissue contrast of MRI. And researchers have even envisioned the possibility of a “tri-modality” scanner — PET, CT, and MRI all in one system. That would give us an even more powerful tool for comprehensive imaging.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
