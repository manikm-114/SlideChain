From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThis table lists some of the most common radioactive tracers used in nuclear medicine. Each tracer has a characteristic half-life and a specific gamma-ray energy.\n\nFor example, technetium-99m has a half-life of about six hours and emits gamma rays at 140 kilo-electronvolts, which is ideal for imaging. Gallium-67 has a longer half-life of about three days and multiple gamma energies. Thallium-201, xenon-133, indium-111, and iodine isotopes are also widely used, each with its own half-lives and energy levels.\n\nYou don’t need to memorize the details of this table. Instead, just recognize that different radionuclides are available for different imaging applications, and their properties — half-life and gamma energy — determine how and where they are best used. This is general knowledge to give you a sense of the variety of tracers available in nuclear medicine.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
