From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nRadioactive isotopes can decay through several different mechanisms, and it’s important to understand the main ones.\n\nIn your textbook, these are grouped into four basic types. The first is alpha decay, the second is beta decay, which includes both beta-minus and beta-plus, or positron, emission — the third is gamma decay, and the fourth is electron capture.\nAn easy way to remember them is simply in order: alpha, beta, gamma, and then electron capture. Each of these processes describes a different way in which an unstable nucleus transforms into a more stable state, releasing radiation in the process.\n\nWe’ll go into detail about each type of decay in the following slides.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
