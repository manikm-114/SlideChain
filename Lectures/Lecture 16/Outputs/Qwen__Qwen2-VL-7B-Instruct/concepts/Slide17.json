From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s begin with alpha decay.\n\nIn alpha decay, an unstable isotope transforms into a daughter nucleus and emits an alpha particle. An alpha particle is essentially the nucleus of a helium atom — two protons and two neutrons bound together.\nAlpha particles carry a relatively high energy, typically in the range of 3 to 7 mega-electronvolts. Because of this, they can cause severe tissue damage. However, they cannot travel far — usually only a few millimeters in biological tissue.\n\nFor this reason, alpha radiation is not useful for imaging. It doesn’t penetrate deeply enough to form images. Instead, it has therapeutic applications. If we can direct alpha-emitting isotopes precisely to cancer cells, they can deliver very localized, highly destructive radiation that kills the tumor while sparing surrounding tissue.\n\nSo, while alpha decay is the first mechanism of radioactive decay we study, it is more relevant to radiation therapy than to nuclear imaging.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
