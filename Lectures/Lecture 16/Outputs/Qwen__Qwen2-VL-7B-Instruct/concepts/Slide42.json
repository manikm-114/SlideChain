From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, let’s take a look at something a bit more advanced and exploratory.\n\nWe know that gamma rays are a form of high-energy electromagnetic radiation, very similar to X-rays, although they are produced differently. In X-ray science, researchers have developed special devices called polycapillary lenses. These lenses use bundles of tiny capillaries to guide and refocus X-rays, effectively bending them toward a focal point. The result is much higher spatial resolution, since the rays that scatter off-path are redirected and concentrated at the detector.\n\nYou can see the schematic here: the X-rays pass through the polycapillary optics, and instead of traveling in random directions, they are collected and focused. This technique has already been applied in confocal micro X-ray fluorescence, which allows elemental analysis within a very small probe volume—even beneath the surface of a material.\n\nNow, the intriguing idea is whether similar optics could be applied to gamma rays in nuclear medicine. If we could refocus gamma rays in this way, we might overcome some of the limitations of mechanical collimators, which block most photons and reduce sensitivity. Polycapillary focusing would potentially increase both sensitivity and resolution, opening up exciting possibilities for future gamma-ray imaging.\n\nThat said, this is not part of the standard clinical toolbox—it’s more of a research direction. I included it here to show you that beyond traditional collimation, there are innovative approaches being explored to push the boundaries of nuclear imaging technology.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
