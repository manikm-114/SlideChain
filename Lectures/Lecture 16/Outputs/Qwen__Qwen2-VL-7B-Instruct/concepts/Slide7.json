From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nToday, we move into a very different story — the basic idea of nuclear imaging. This principle is absolutely fundamental.\nJust like in X-ray imaging, we are still working with radiation. But here’s the key difference: in nuclear imaging, the radiation does not come from an external source outside the body. Instead, it comes from inside the patient, because we introduce a radioactive tracer into the body. That tracer emits gamma rays.\n\nNow, gamma rays and X-rays are very similar. Their energy ranges overlap, although gamma rays are usually considered to be slightly more energetic. Both are forms of electromagnetic radiation, part of the same spectrum. Importantly, like X-rays, gamma rays can penetrate the body.\nBut if we simply detect gamma rays without direction, we only get a collection of signals with no spatial meaning. To form an image, we need to know where each photon came from. This is why we use a collimator — such as a pinhole collimator or a parallel-hole collimator. The collimator ensures that only photons traveling along certain directions are recorded, giving us the directional information we need for tomographic imaging.\nAfter passing through the collimator, the gamma rays strike a scintillation crystal. This crystal converts the high-energy gamma photons into flashes of visible light. Next, photomultiplier tubes take that light and convert it into electrical signals, amplifying the signal dramatically.\nThose electrical signals are then digitized and sent to a computer. One measurement gives us a single projection. By collecting many projections from different angles, we can reconstruct a tomographic image.\n\nIt’s important to understand what the resulting image represents. It is not showing us anatomical structure, like CT does. Instead, it shows the distribution of the radioactive tracer inside the body. That means the image reflects physiology — the function of tissues — rather than just anatomy. This is the key and very powerful idea behind nuclear imaging.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
