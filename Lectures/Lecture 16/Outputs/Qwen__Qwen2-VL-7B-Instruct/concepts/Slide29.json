From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s take a closer look at the first two methods: neutron capture and nuclear fission. Both of these require a nuclear reactor.\n\nA nuclear reactor is essentially a device that initiates and controls a sustained chain reaction. In a typical power plant, this chain reaction produces heat, which is then transferred into a working fluid like water or gas, and eventually used to generate electricity.\nBut for our purpose in nuclear medicine, reactors play a different role — they are used to produce radionuclides. In neutron capture, a nucleus absorbs an extra neutron and becomes unstable, creating a useful isotope. In nuclear fission, a heavy nucleus splits into smaller nuclei, and among the products are medically important isotopes such as molybdenum-99, which is the precursor of technetium-99m.\n\nBetween the two, nuclear fission is more popular today because it is more efficient and cost-effective than neutron capture. Still, both methods remain central to the production of medical tracers — though they are limited by the need for specialized, large-scale reactor facilities.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
