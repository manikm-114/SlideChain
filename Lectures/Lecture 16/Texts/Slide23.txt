Here is another way of classifying radioactive decay. In total, you can think of five types.

First, alpha decay, which typically occurs among the heavier elements. Second, beta-minus decay. Third, positron emission, or beta-plus decay. Fourth, electron capture. And finally, spontaneous fission.
For our purposes, the first four are the most important. Spontaneous fission is more of a nuclear physics phenomenon and is not especially relevant to medical imaging.

So, depending on which textbook you consult, you may see these processes grouped slightly differently. But for this course, just keep in mind the essential ones: alpha, beta, gamma, and electron capture. Within beta decay, remember there are two cases — beta-minus and beta-plus.
With that, you now have a solid overview of the main decay mechanisms we will encounter in nuclear imaging.
