As you can see from the course schedule, we are right on track. We’ve already covered the earlier topics such as introduction, system concepts, Fourier series, and signal processing. More recently, we completed modules on CT reconstruction and MATLAB applications.

Today’s lecture is focusing on nuclear physics. In the next lecture, we will explain SPECT and PET imaging principles and systems. After that, we will move on to MRI, ultrasound, and optical imaging, before wrapping up the course with the final exam.

So everything is proceeding according to plan.
