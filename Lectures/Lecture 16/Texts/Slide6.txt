Here we see X-ray CT, which you are already familiar with from earlier lectures. Let me give you a quick review.
In conventional CT, the system typically uses an energy-integrating detector. This means that all of the incoming X-ray photons are combined, and the result is an averaged measurement over the entire X-ray spectrum. That gives us the grayscale images you know well, where tissues appear in shades from black to white.

Now, with more advanced technology, we can use photon-counting detectors. These detectors are energy-sensitive, which means they can record not only the number of photons but also their energies. By sorting the detected photons into many energy bins, we can see the full X-ray spectrum, including characteristic features called K-edges for different materials.

This approach allows us to separate and identify materials such as gold, iodine, calcium, and fat. In other words, instead of just a grayscale image, we can create color-coded images that reflect the molecular composition of the tissue or phantom. This is called spectral, or molecular, CT.
So, with photon-counting CT, we move beyond structural imaging into the possibility of functional and molecular imaging — a very exciting direction for the future.
