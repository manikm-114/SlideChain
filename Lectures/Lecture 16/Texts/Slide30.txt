Let’s now underline the second method, which is nuclear fission. The first method, neutron capture, is less commonly used today, so we’ll focus more on fission.

What happens in nuclear fission? The nucleus of a heavy atom, such as uranium-235, absorbs a high-energy particle like a neutron. This creates an unstable excited state. As a result, the nucleus splits into two lighter nuclei, along with a few free neutrons, gamma photons, and a large release of energy.

On the right-hand side, you can see the process illustrated. Uranium-235 absorbs a neutron and briefly becomes uranium-236. That unstable nucleus then splits into two smaller fragments, krypton-92 and barium-141, along with additional neutrons. Those free neutrons can go on to trigger further reactions, creating a chain process.
This principle is very powerful. It’s the same physics behind nuclear power plants and, unfortunately, also nuclear weapons. In our context, though, fission is important mainly because it can be used to produce medically useful radionuclides, such as molybdenum-99, which later decays into technetium-99m for imaging.

That said, in this course, we won’t emphasize the reactor-based methods too heavily. Instead, we’ll focus more on the radionuclide generator, since that is what you are most likely to encounter in clinical imaging practice.
