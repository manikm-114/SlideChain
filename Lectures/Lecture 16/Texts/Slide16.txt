Radioactive isotopes can decay through several different mechanisms, and it’s important to understand the main ones.

In your textbook, these are grouped into four basic types. The first is alpha decay, the second is beta decay, which includes both beta-minus and beta-plus, or positron, emission — the third is gamma decay, and the fourth is electron capture.
An easy way to remember them is simply in order: alpha, beta, gamma, and then electron capture. Each of these processes describes a different way in which an unstable nucleus transforms into a more stable state, releasing radiation in the process.

We’ll go into detail about each type of decay in the following slides.
