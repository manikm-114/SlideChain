Now let’s look at how technetium-99m is actually used in medicine. This table lists some of the most common radiopharmaceuticals and their clinical applications. What you can see immediately is how versatile this isotope is—it can target almost every major system of the body.

For example, technetium-labeled macroaggregated albumin is used for pulmonary perfusion studies, helping us assess blood flow in the lungs. Diphosphonates labeled with technetium are widely applied in skeletal imaging, especially for detecting bone metastases. For the brain, compounds like glucoheptonate or HMPAO can be used to image tumors or measure brain perfusion. Sulfur colloid labeled with technetium allows us to visualize the liver, spleen, and even sentinel lymph nodes. DTPA is useful for renal function and pulmonary ventilation studies. And compounds like sestamibi are used to evaluate myocardial perfusion, making technetium imaging an essential tool in cardiology.

So what do we learn from this? With just a single isotope—technetium-99m—we can design radiopharmaceuticals to study the lungs, bones, brain, liver, kidneys, heart, and more. This is one of the main reasons technetium-99m became the workhorse of nuclear medicine.
With that, we finish our discussion of tracer production. We have seen the different ways isotopes can be generated, particularly the third and fourth methods—cyclotrons for producing positron emitters used in PET imaging, and generators for producing technetium-99m used in SPECT imaging.

Now, we move into the last part of today’s lecture: data acquisition. Here, we’ll focus on two main approaches. The first is the gamma camera, which detects single gamma-ray photons and is central to SPECT, or single photon emission computed tomography. The second is coincidence detection, which captures pairs of gamma photons emitted simultaneously, and this is the basis of PET, or positron emission tomography.
As we go through this, keep in mind the difference: SPECT relies on detecting individual gamma photons, while PET relies on detecting photon pairs from positron annihilation. And this difference has profound implications for scanner design and image quality.
