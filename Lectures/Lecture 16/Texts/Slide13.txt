This slide is mainly a review of basic nuclear physics concepts: the atomic number and the mass number.
The atomic number, denoted by Z, is simply the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom. The mass number, usually written as A, is the total number of nucleons, meaning the number of protons plus the number of neutrons. In most cases, the atomic weight is approximately equal to this mass number.

For example, in helium, the atomic number is 2, because there are two protons. The mass number is 4, because helium has two protons and two neutrons. When an atom is neutral, the number of electrons surrounding the nucleus matches the number of protons in the nucleus. This keeps the charge balanced.
Now, once we understand atomic number and mass number, we can define what isotopes are.
