As I mentioned earlier, the flux of gamma rays coming out of the body is very low. That means the signals are extremely weak. To make them useful, we need to amplify them, and that’s where the photomultiplier tube, or PMT, comes in.

Here’s how it works. When a gamma ray enters the scintillation crystal, it produces a small flash of visible light. That light then strikes the photocathode inside the PMT. The photocathode is a special surface that converts each photon of light into an electron.
Now, a single electron is still a very small signal, so the PMT uses a series of plates called dynodes. Each time an electron strikes a dynode, it knocks loose multiple new electrons. By the time this process is repeated across several dynodes, the signal has been multiplied millions of times.
At the final stage, what started as just one or two photons of light has been amplified into a strong stream of electrons—a measurable current. This current is then sent out of the PMT as an analog signal, which can later be digitized for image reconstruction.

So the PMT performs two essential functions: it converts light into electrons, and then it magnifies that tiny signal step by step until it’s strong enough to record. Without this amplification process, the gamma camera simply wouldn’t be able to detect enough information to form an image.
