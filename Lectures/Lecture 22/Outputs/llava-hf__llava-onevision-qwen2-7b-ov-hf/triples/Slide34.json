Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere we move to spectral Doppler imaging, as shown in Figure 3.23 from your textbook. This method provides more detailed information about the range of velocities within a vessel. You can see how the signal amplitude varies over the cardiac cycle — during systole, when the heart contracts, and diastole, when it relaxes. During systole, the flow velocity is higher, which shifts the Doppler frequency upward. During diastole, the flow slows down, so the Doppler shift becomes smaller.\n\nThe result is a spectrum showing how signal amplitude changes with Doppler frequency over time. Each vertical line in the display represents the distribution of frequencies — or velocities — at a given instant. When plotted together, this forms the spectral waveform, which you often see in clinical Doppler displays. By analyzing these patterns, clinicians can assess blood flow speed, direction, and uniformity through the cardiac cycle.\n\nSo, to summarize, Doppler imaging includes several complementary modes: continuous wave, pulsed wave, and correlation methods, along with color and spectral Doppler. Continuous and pulsed modes measure velocity; color Doppler visualizes it; and spectral Doppler reveals its frequency content. Together, they provide a comprehensive view of motion and flow in ultrasound imaging — anatomically and dynamically.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
