Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nI feel quite good today, moving into the second part of ultrasound imaging. After this lecture, we’ll teach the last imaging modality —optical imaging, in one lecture.\n\nNow, we’ll follow the green textbook fairly closely. I strongly recommend that you read the chapter on ultrasound imaging — it’s about twenty-three pages long. If you read through the chapter carefully, you’ll have a very good understanding of everything we’re covering. I encourage you again to review or re-review that chapter, because it will really help you master today’s lecture.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"ultrasound imaging\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"textbook\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"I strongly recommend that you read the chapter on ultrasound imaging — it’s about twenty-three pages long.
