Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, this is a phased array, and you can extend the same concept to the two-dimensional case. Instead of having one line of elements, you now have a grid—a 2D array of transducer elements.\n\nBy controlling the phase and timing in two dimensions, you can purposely focus along the principal axis, or you can steer the beam left, right, up, or down—even in a circular pattern if you wish. This allows for electronic focusing and beam steering in both dimensions, giving you precise control over the acoustic field.\n\nSo, in summary, the 2D phased array operates the same way as the 1D version but adds another level of control. It enables full 3D imaging capabilities, higher flexibility, and more advanced ultrasound applications.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"phased array\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"grid of transducer elements\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"You can extend the same concept to the two-dimensional case.
