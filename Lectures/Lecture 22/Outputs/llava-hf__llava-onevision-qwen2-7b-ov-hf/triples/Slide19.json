Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThe second part of this lecture focuses on dynamic imaging, particularly on how we measure motion, such as blood flow velocity or heart wall movement. To do this, we rely on the Doppler effect.\n\nSo, what exactly is the Doppler effect? It’s a physical principle that describes how the observed frequency of a wave changes when there is relative motion between the source and the observer. In ultrasound, this effect allows us to calculate how fast and in what direction blood is moving inside the body.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1].
