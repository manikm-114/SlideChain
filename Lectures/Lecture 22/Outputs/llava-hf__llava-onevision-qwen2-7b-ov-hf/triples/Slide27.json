  "raw_output": "user \nSystem:\nYou are extracting factual relations from a medical imaging lecture. Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThe second mode we use is called pulsed wave Doppler. In this mode, we do not send ultrasound continuously. Instead, we transmit a series of short pulses — almost like delta functions — separated in time. It’s not exactly a delta function, but it’s very narrow in duration. \n\nSo, at time one, you send out the first pulse into the tissue along the time axis. Then, after receiving the echo back, at time two, you send out the second pulse, and so on. Each pulse travels into the tissue, reflects from structures, and returns to the transducer. The process repeats again and again, one pulse at a time, to measure motion and flow at specific depths within the body.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"Pulsed wave Doppler\", \"p\":\"uses\",\n     \"o\":\"Ultrasound\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":1.0, \"evidence\":\"In this mode, we do not send ultrasound continuously.
