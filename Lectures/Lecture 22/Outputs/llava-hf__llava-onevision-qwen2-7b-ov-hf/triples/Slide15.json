  "raw_output": "user \nSystem:\nYou are extracting factual relations from a medical imaging lecture. Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, let’s look at the annular array. You can make the ultrasound beam radially symmetric, or what we sometimes call recirculately symmetric. Basically, you can design a circular symmetric arrangement of piezoelectric elements, like the one shown here. With this type of array, you cannot do circular scanning—because it’s already circularly symmetric—but you can focus along the principal direction.\n\nThe advantage is that you can control the focal distance very easily. You can make the focus point closer or farther, depending on the time delay and how you drive those circular rings. So you can adjust the focal distance to be small or large. That’s something you can easily do with this annular array structure.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"annular array\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"radially symmetric\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"You can make the ultrasound beam radially symmetric, or what we sometimes call recirculately symmetric.\"}\n  ]\n}",
