From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, let’s talk about the next type of artifact, which is caused by what we call side lobes. In ultrasound imaging, no matter how you modulate the transducer elements — whether you use a one-dimensional or a two-dimensional array, or even a single transducer — you can never create a perfectly straight, narrow beam. Each transducer element generates a spherical wave, and when these waves combine through interference, they form one strong main beam along the principal direction, plus several weaker beams on the sides — these are the side lobes.\n\nPhysically, this happens because we’re dealing with waves, and waves naturally spread out. Even if we adjust the phase and amplitude across the array, we can’t perfectly confine all the energy into a single pencil-thin line. The best we can achieve is a main lobe with high intensity, surrounded by smaller side lobes with lower intensity. If you’ve studied Fourier analysis, this is similar to what happens when you approximate a sharp function — you always get some rippling, known as ringing. Here, the same principle applies to the ultrasound beam.\n\nNow, these side lobes can create misleading signals in the image. For example, if you’re scanning a region with a single bright reflector, the main lobe gives a strong echo at the correct location. But the side lobes can also pick up reflections from off-axis points, which then appear as false echoes in the image — often as smaller or dimmer copies of the real structure. So, you might see multiple bright spots, even though only one real reflector exists. In clinical practice, recognizing this artifact is essential — you may move the transducer slightly to confirm which echo is genuine and which is an artifact.\n\nAnother related effect is reverberation, which happens when echoes bounce back and forth between two reflective surfaces — such as tissue layers or an air-tissue interface. These multiple reflections cause several delayed echoes to appear on the image, even though only one actual surface exists. They appear as repeated, evenly spaced lines, decreasing in intensity with depth. You can see examples of these side lobe patterns and reverberation artifacts in the slide images here. Understanding them helps you identify what’s real and what’s simply an effect of wave interference and multiple reflection.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
