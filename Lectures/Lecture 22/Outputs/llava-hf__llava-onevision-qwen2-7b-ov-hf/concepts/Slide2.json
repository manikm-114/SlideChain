From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nI feel quite good today, moving into the second part of ultrasound imaging. After this lecture, we’ll teach the last imaging modality —optical imaging, in one lecture.\n\nNow, we’ll follow the green textbook fairly closely. I strongly recommend that you read the chapter on ultrasound imaging — it’s about twenty-three pages long. If you read through the chapter carefully, you’ll have a very good understanding of everything we’re covering. I encourage you again to review or re-review that chapter, because it will really help you master today’s lecture.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"ultrasound imaging\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"green textbook\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"twenty-three pages\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"carefully\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"master\", \"category\": \"software\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"After this lecture, we’ll teach the last imaging modality —optical imaging, in one lecture.\", \"I strongly recommend that you read the chapter on ultrasound imaging — it’s about twenty-three pages long.\", \"I encourage you again to review or re-review that chapter, because it will really help you master today’s lecture.\"]\n}\n```",
