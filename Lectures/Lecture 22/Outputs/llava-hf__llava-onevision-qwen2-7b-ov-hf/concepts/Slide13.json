From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet me make this clearer using a linear phased array example. If you fire all the pulses at the same time, all the elements are activated together, and the ultrasound beam travels straight ahead in one direction.\n\nHowever, if you adjust the timing slightly, you can shape the beam. For instance, if you fire elements 1 and 5 a little earlier, as shown on the time axis here, where this point is time zero, and then fire the others with slight delays, you create different wavefronts that add up. At first, two spherical waves are generated from elements 1 and 5. Then, a bit later, elements 2 and 4 emit their waves, and finally, the central element fires last. When all these small wavelets combine, they form a curved wavefront, producing a focused ultrasound field downward, with the focal spot located here.\n\nNow, the distance of this focus—how deep it forms from the transducer surface—depends on the relative time delays between the elements. If you apply the delay more gradually, the focus will form more deeply. By changing the delay pattern, you can also tilt the beam—to the left-hand side or the right-hand side—by linearly shifting the delay across elements. This gives you complete flexibility in how you steer and focus the beam.\n\nThe essential idea here follows Huygens’ principle—each element acts as an individual source, generating its own waveform with a controlled relative phase. By adjusting the phase and timing, you can create different acoustic or optical effects. This is how beam steering and dynamic focusing are achieved in a phased array.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
