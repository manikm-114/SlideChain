From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nIn the next lecture, we’ll move into optical imaging, but before that, let’s look at how ultrasound and optical imaging can be combined to create a powerful new imaging technique known as photoacoustic tomography. The idea is shown here. Imagine you inject an animal with contrast agents — in this case, graphene-based microbubbles. Once these microbubbles are introduced, they enhance the ultrasound signal because the presence of microbubbles makes acoustic reflections stronger.\n\nNow, graphene has an interesting property: it can absorb light energy and convert it into heat. So, when you shine near-infrared light pulses onto the tissue, the graphene microbubbles absorb the light and heat up slightly. This heating causes a tiny thermal expansion — the microbubbles expand and contract in response to the pulsed laser. Each laser pulse causes a brief expansion followed by cooling, and this mechanical vibration generates an acoustic wave, much like a sound pulse. These acoustic waves are then detected by an ultrasound transducer.\n\nSo, you can think of the process as a chain: near-infrared excitation leads to graphene absorption, which causes heating and thermal expansion, generating acoustic waves that are picked up by an ultrasonic detector. From these signals, you can construct an image for diagnosis. The advantage is that the contrast is introduced optically, while the detection is done acoustically, giving both sensitivity and depth penetration. In addition, some of these microbubbles can be used for therapeutic applications — for example, targeted drug delivery. There’s a lot of exciting research happening in this area, exploring both diagnostic and therapeutic uses.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
