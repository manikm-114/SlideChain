  "raw_output": "user \nSystem:\nYou are an expert educator in medical imaging. From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThe second part of this lecture focuses on dynamic imaging, particularly on how we measure motion, such as blood flow velocity or heart wall movement. To do this, we rely on the Doppler effect.\n\nSo, what exactly is the Doppler effect? It’s a physical principle that describes how the observed frequency of a wave changes when there is relative motion between the source and the observer. In ultrasound, this effect allows us to calculate how fast and in what direction blood is moving inside the body.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"Doppler effect\", \"category\": \"physics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"blood flow velocity\", \"category\": \"anatomy\"},\n    {\"term\": \"heart wall movement\", \"category\": \"anatomy\"},\n    {\"term\": \"ultrasound\", \"category\": \"modality\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"It’s a physical principle that describes how the observed frequency of a wave changes when there is relative motion between the source and the observer.
