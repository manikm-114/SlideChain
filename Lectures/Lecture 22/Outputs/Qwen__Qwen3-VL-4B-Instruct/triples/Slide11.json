Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLooking at this picture, you think: this is a current wavefront. You have multiple small secondary sources here. Each source forms a small secondary spherical wave. These waves together—the envelope formed by all these secondary spherical waves added together—form the next wavefront. In this first case, the next wavefront has the same shape as the previous or current wavefront, so a spherical wavefront propagates as a spherical wavefront. That looks right.\n\nIf you have a plane wave propagating forward, the plane wavefront can also be decomposed into sources—A, B, C, D, and so on. Each is a secondary spherical wave. Again, the envelope of all these small spherical waves forms a plane, which is a new wavefront parallel to your current wavefront, parallel to the previous wavefront. That illustrates how a plane wave propagates along one direction—the direction of beam propagation.\n\nNow, if you have a small aperture, the plane wave goes down to the opening. Because you have multiple yellow sources across that aperture, and each yellow source is treated as an individual point source vibrating out sound or light, you observe diffraction. The light or sound will no longer go perfectly straight; it will bend around the edges—turn around, so to speak.\nIf you have two slits, the waves from the two openings will interfere due to phase differences. At some points the two spherical waves—one from here and one from the other opening—will add constructively; at other points they will cancel. If you place a screen there, you will observe bright and dark strips. This is interference.\n\nThe reflection, the refraction, and many old optical or ultrasonic phenomena can be explained similarly. You have a plane wave here; the wave is incident at a surface. At the surface, you again treat it with Huygens’ sources. Depending on the location, this point is hit earlier and its secondary spherical wave is generated in this direction; that point is hit later and its spherical wave has a smaller extent. The envelope will be defined by straight lines—like plane fronts—depending on the speed of sound or light in the two media, the relative speed in the two media. You will see the transmitted beam change direction. The direction change is determined by the relative speeds of the wave in the first and second medium. This explains a lot of wave phenomena—very cool.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
