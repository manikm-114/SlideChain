Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere you see some examples of photoacoustic tomography from Professor Lihong Wang, who made pioneering contributions to this field. This imaging method can be applied at multiple scales — from single cells and small biological structures to whole animals and even human patients. The remarkable thing is that it combines the strengths of both optical and ultrasound imaging.\n\nPurely optical imaging provides excellent contrast but limited penetration depth — the light scatters too easily, so you can only see shallow structures. Ultrasound, on the other hand, penetrates much deeper and gives good spatial resolution, but the contrast is not as strong because it depends mainly on acoustic properties. When you combine the two in photoacoustic imaging, you get the best of both worlds: strong optical contrast and deeper acoustic penetration.\n\nThis hybrid approach allows researchers to visualize structures ranging from microvasculature to organ-level features, making it a powerful tool for both biological research and clinical applications. It’s a perfect example of how multi-modality imaging can overcome the limitations of individual techniques.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
