Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nOK, think about a linear array. A linear array is to put multiple piezoelectric transducers along a line. So you have multiple elements, and you can selectively make a subset of transducers on. This is the light—this subset is selected in this case. These elements are selected. You use these three as your ultrasound sources, so this beam will go down the road this way. \n\nYou do scanning as if this were just a single transducer aperture. Then you can define the next line—you just group elements differently. Then you have a neighboring line, line 2, sending ultrasound waves downward. OK. Next instant, you generate line 3. So you have a line of piezoelectric elements; the elements remain, but each time, the first second—you use this part; the second second, you use the second group. You keep doing this.\n\nThe physical effect is that you send one beam here; next, you send another beam. You keep doing A-mode scanning along many lines. But you do the beam scanning to form a B-mode image not by manually changing location or angle—you do it mechanically or electronically. This is very convenient. You have a reform, so you use the acoustic transducer array, and you can perform scanning easily. And not only scanning, you can also do beam forming—a lot of flexibility.\n\nSo, here, I would like to explain to you.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
