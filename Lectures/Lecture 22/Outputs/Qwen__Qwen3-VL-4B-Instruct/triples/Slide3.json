Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo here, I’m explaining the key points — the way I think helps you summarize what really matters. But remember, you still need to read the textbook. It’s not that you can just sit back, listen to my talk, and skip the reading. No, you really have to read the textbook. That’s how you build a good memory and a solid foundation. Two ultrasound imaging lectures in a classroom is not enough if you only listen passively. What I’m giving you here is a general yet quick descriptioin of ultrasound imaging methods — and specifically, how we actually form images.\n\nNow, this topic can be divided into two main parts. The first part is about imaging modes. We’ll talk about different types of ultrasound imaging modes — basically, A-mode, B-mode, C-mode, and M-mode, sometimes also called I-mode. What do these mean? Each mode represents a different way of collecting and displaying ultrasound data. There are multiple ideas behind them, and one very important concept that the textbook doesn’t explain in detail — but I believe you really need to know — is called Huygens’ principle. I checked the pronunciation; it’s “Huygens’ principle.” This is a very important physical idea. Understanding this principle will give you a much deeper grasp of how array-based scanning and beam forming work. It shows how you can focus ultrasound beams at different depths and times, giving you tremendous flexibility in image formation.\n\nIn the second part, we’ll move on to Doppler imaging. This part deals with dynamic image formation — it allows us to measure both the speed and the direction of motion, such as blood flow in vessels or motion of the heart chambers. Doppler imaging can be implemented in several ways: you can use continuous ultrasound waves, or you can send out sequences of pulses. It’s a very important imaging mode. We’ll also discuss echo correlation and color Doppler. All these topics are explained clearly in the textbook, so please read that section carefully to strengthen your understanding.\n\nFinally, we’ll look briefly at image artifacts and at some new things — this last part is more for fun and inspiration. We won’t go into all the advanced new ideas in detail. The first three parts — the imaging modes, Huygens’ principle, and Doppler imaging — are what you’ll be tested on. So, let’s begin by asking: what exactly is the A-mode?\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
