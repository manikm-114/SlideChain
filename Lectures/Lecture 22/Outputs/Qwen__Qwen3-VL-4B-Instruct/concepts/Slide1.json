From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLast time, we explained to you the physical and mathematical principles for ultrasound imaging.\n\nIn this lecture, we will be more specific about how we can form different kinds of ultrasound images. We’re moving from principles to practice—how we send sound, receive echoes, and turn those echoes into the different image types for various clinical tasks.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
