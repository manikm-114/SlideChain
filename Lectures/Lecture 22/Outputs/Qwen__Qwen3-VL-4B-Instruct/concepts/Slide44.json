From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nFinally, here’s something still speculative – an iPhone-based ultrasound imager. With this device, we could turn an iPhone into a miniature ultrasound device. Imagine using your phone not just as a communication tool but as a health monitoring instrument. For example, we might use the phone’s screen or back surface as a transducer array to measure things like blood velocity, blood pressure, or even blood sugar.\n\nLet’s consider blood pressure first. Traditionally, blood pressure is measured with a cuff that compresses the vessel, but perhaps we could use Doppler ultrasound principles instead. When blood flows through a vessel, the pressure from the heartbeat changes both the velocity and the cross-sectional area of the vessel. When the pressure is high, the vessel expands; when it’s low, the vessel contracts. The velocity of blood flow also changes accordingly and can be measured. The shape of vessels can be measured as well.\n\nIf we could measure both the velocity (through the Doppler shift) and the vessel wall motion (by detecting the relative distance between the top and bottom surfaces), then, with proper calibration and machine learning, we might estimate blood pressure accurately — just by placing the iPhone over the skin. Over time, the system could learn your personal profile and give real-time blood pressure readings without the discomfort of a cuff. The same principle could even be extended to use an optical sensor for measuring blood sugar related signals, by analyzing light interactions with tissue. These ideas are still pre-mature, but with advances in materials, transducers and sensors, they may become realistic in the future.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
