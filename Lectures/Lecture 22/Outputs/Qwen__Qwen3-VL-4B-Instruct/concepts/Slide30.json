From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, let’s talk about the pulsed wave Doppler mode. In this method, we don’t use a continuous wave. Instead, we send out short, separated pulses—each one acting somewhat like a delta function. It’s not exactly a delta function, but it behaves like one in time. \n\nSo, at time one, you send out a pulse into the tissue, and after a short delay, you receive the echo back. Then, at time two, you send the next pulse, and again you wait for the return signal. You keep sending these pulses one after another, in sequence. Each pulse travels into the tissue, interacts with the structures, and returns as a backscattered echo. The transducer then captures this echo signal, allowing you to measure reflections from specific depths—what we call the range gate.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
