Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, I’ve included here two images from another textbook that show this more graphically. You can see how the pulses are sent one after another into the biological tissue. Between each transmitted pulse, there is a fixed time delay. That time interval is the pulse repetition period, and the inverse of that is called the pulse repetition frequency. This repetition rate is an important parameter because it determines how deep your ultrasound can penetrate and how fast you can sample motion.\n\nEach pulse travels into the tissue and produces echoes that return at different times depending on the depth of the reflecting structure. These returning echoes — let’s call them echo one, echo two, echo three — come from slightly different layers or scattering surfaces inside the tissue. If there is no motion, the interval between successive echoes remains the same. But if there is motion — for instance, blood flowing or tissue moving — that spacing changes slightly. By measuring the change in the timing or phase of these echoes, we can estimate velocity.\n\nIn pulsed wave Doppler, we can also target a specific depth, often referred to as the gate depth. This means we can focus the measurement on a particular region of interest within the body. The operator can adjust this gate — make it deeper, shallower, wider, or narrower — to control the resolution and sensitivity of the measurement. By analyzing how the returned echoes shift over time, we can extract information about both motion and flow at that specific location.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
