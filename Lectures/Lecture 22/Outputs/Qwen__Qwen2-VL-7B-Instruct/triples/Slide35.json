Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nFinally, let’s talk briefly about ultrasound image artifacts. Like any imaging modality, ultrasound is not perfect — and various artifacts can appear due to limitations in the system or the physics of sound propagation. These artifacts may come from reflection, refraction, attenuation, or motion. Some are simply distortions, while others can mimic real anatomical structures.\n\nUnderstanding and recognizing these artifacts is extremely important, because they can affect how you interpret the image. We’ll look at examples of these artifacts and discuss what causes them, and how they can sometimes even be used advantageously in image interpretation.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"Ultrasound image artifacts\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\", \"o\":\"Ultrasound imaging\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"Like any imaging modality, ultrasound is not perfect — and various artifacts can appear due to limitations in the system or the physics of sound propagation.
