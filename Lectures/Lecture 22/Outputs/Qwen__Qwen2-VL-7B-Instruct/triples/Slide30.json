Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, let’s talk about the pulsed wave Doppler mode. In this method, we don’t use a continuous wave. Instead, we send out short, separated pulses—each one acting somewhat like a delta function. It’s not exactly a delta function, but it behaves like one in time. \n\nSo, at time one, you send out a pulse into the tissue, and after a short delay, you receive the echo back. Then, at time two, you send the next pulse, and again you wait for the return signal. You keep sending these pulses one after another, in sequence. Each pulse travels into the tissue, interacts with the structures, and returns as a backscattered echo. The transducer then captures this echo signal, allowing you to measure reflections from specific depths—what we call the range gate.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"Pulsed Wave (PW) Doppler\", \"p\":\"uses\", \"o\":\"Doppler principle\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"does not make use of the Doppler principle!\"}\n  ]\n}",
