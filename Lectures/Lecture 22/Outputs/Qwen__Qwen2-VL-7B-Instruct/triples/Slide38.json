Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s continue with more examples of ultrasound artifacts. One common type is caused by multiple reflections between layers. Imagine sending one ultrasound pulse into a structure like the lung. The wave first reflects from the top surface, giving you the first echo. Some energy penetrates deeper, hits the bottom surface, and reflects. But on its way, that echo may bounce again from the top surface and return once more to the transducer. As a result, even though you sent only one pulse, you detect several echoes arriving at different times. This produces a sequence of repeated bands on the image — very similar to hearing multiple “hellos” echoing in a mountain valley after shouting once.\n\nAnother important artifact is acoustic shadowing. This occurs when a dense object — for instance, a gallstone or kidney stone — strongly reflects or absorbs the ultrasound energy. Because the wave cannot penetrate beyond it, there’s no signal coming from the tissue behind the object. On the image, this appears as a dark region, or “shadow,” extending below the bright reflective surface. You can clearly see this in the figure on the right, where the shadow forms behind a gallstone.\n\nIn the images on this slide, you can see both types of artifacts — reverberation lines appearing as repeated echoes, and acoustic shadowing creating dark regions behind dense materials. Recognizing these patterns is essential for accurate diagnosis. They’re not always errors; sometimes they actually help identify the nature of the structure — for example, confirming the presence of a stone or a metallic implant. But conceptually, you should always understand how these artifacts form and what they tell you about the ultrasound-tissue interaction.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
