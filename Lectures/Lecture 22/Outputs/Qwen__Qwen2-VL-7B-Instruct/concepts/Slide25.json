From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThese concepts are quite straightforward, and it’s good to know them as part of your general understanding. In continuous wave Doppler, the transducer is divided into two separate parts—one part for transmission and the other for reception. The transmitting part continuously sends ultrasound waves toward the region of interest, while the receiving part continuously collects the reflected signals.\n\nSo, you have a single transducer housing two elements. One is always sending, and the other is always listening. The signal that is sent out has a fixed transmission frequency, while the reflected signal may have a slightly different frequency because of the Doppler shift caused by motion. What you send and what you receive differ slightly in frequency, and that difference directly relates to the motion along the ultrasound beam direction.\nThe region of interest is where the transmitted and received beams overlap. This overlapping region is the sensitive zone from which the Doppler signals are detected. If the reflection occurs outside that overlap, the signal will not be received effectively.\n\nIn summary, continuous wave Doppler requires two separate elements—one for emission and one for detection—because a single element cannot transmit and receive continuously at the same time. So, CW Doppler uses continuous waves for both sending and receiving, providing constant velocity measurement but without specific depth localization.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
