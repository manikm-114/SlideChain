From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, let’s look at the annular array. You can make the ultrasound beam radially symmetric, or what we sometimes call recirculately symmetric. Basically, you can design a circular symmetric arrangement of piezoelectric elements, like the one shown here. With this type of array, you cannot do circular scanning—because it’s already circularly symmetric—but you can focus along the principal direction.\n\nThe advantage is that you can control the focal distance very easily. You can make the focus point closer or farther, depending on the time delay and how you drive those circular rings. So you can adjust the focal distance to be small or large. That’s something you can easily do with this annular array structure.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
