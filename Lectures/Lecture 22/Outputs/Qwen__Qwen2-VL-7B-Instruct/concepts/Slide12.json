From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, let’s look at this example—an ultrasonic transducer array shown here inside the blue box. If you have a beam that is focused toward a certain direction, it shines in a specific mode, and you will have a wavefront forming within that blue region. So, what happens to the wave? Essentially, it behaves as if that entire front of energy is moving outward through the medium.\n\nBut here, instead of a continuous wavefront, we use a two-dimensional acoustic transducer to recreate that same wave behavior. In other words, we can replace the natural wavefront with this 2D transducer array. By doing so, we can electronically control each element in the array to operate exactly the way the original wavefront would. This means that the two-dimensional transducer can emulate the same effect as the real wave field.\n\nWith this approach, we can do the same kinds of operations—focusing, scanning, and steering the beam—with great flexibility. As long as each individual transducer element is driven properly, the array can reproduce the correct wave behavior. This is how we visualize and control wave propagation in a precise, programmable way.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
