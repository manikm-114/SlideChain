From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, let me just copy this figure to help explain the idea. This shows a one-dimensional ultrasound array. If you use just this group of transducers, you can certainly do beam forming. You perform focusing in this way—based on the relative time delays across elements.\n\nYou can adjust the focus at a certain depth—from the transducer surface to the focal plane—and make the focus spot here. You receive signals mainly from this region of interest. Then, this group of signals can be moved laterally.\nFrom left to right, you perform scanning—line by line—so you get information along each line. When you repeat this line-by-line process, you effectively build up a two-dimensional image.\n\nSo, in summary, with beam forming, you control how the echoes are added together in time, and with scanning, you move the beam position across the field. Together, they form the foundation of modern ultrasound imaging.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
