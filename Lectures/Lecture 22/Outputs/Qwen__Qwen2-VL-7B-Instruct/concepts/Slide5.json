From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s move on to the second one — B-mode. B stands for brightness. That’s the keyword to remember here. B-mode is a very powerful imaging technique. You can think of it as an extension of A-mode — instead of a single amplitude trace, you’re now using multiple A-mode scans to create a two-dimensional image.\n\nHere’s how it works: in A-mode, you send one ultrasound pulse into the tissue and receive echoes from a single line of depth. In B-mode, you repeat that process at many different positions. You scan line by line — one A-mode here, another next to it, and so on. By combining all these one-dimensional signals, you form a two-dimensional image that shows amplitude, or intensity, as brightness. So, what you finally get is a picture — an intensity map of the internal structures.\n\nYou’re not limited to scanning straight, parallel lines either. Just like in X-ray CT, you can use a fan-beam geometry — instead of sending one beam directly forward, the transducer sweeps across an angle, covering a larger area. This sweeping motion allows you to reconstruct a full cross-sectional view of the tissue. I’ll show you another short movie clip to give you a better visual sense of this process.\n\nNow, let’s look at the movies. First, you see the A-mode. Here — look carefully. The pulse on the right is the ultrasound wave being transmitted into the biological tissue. The blue dots represent backscattered echoes — reflections from different structures inside the tissue. Notice that the same transducer both sends and receives the signal. So, when the pulse goes out, the transducer then listens for the returning echoes.\n\nLet’s play that again. Watch the blue dots — those are the echoes. You can see how they appear as small reflections. The tail of the pulse gets weaker as it travels deeper — that’s where you receive the last few echoes. This gives you a one-dimensional signal profile, which is what we call A-mode.\nNow, look at the next one — this is B-mode scanning. Each line in the image corresponds to one A-mode scan. When you stack many A-mode scans side by side, you form a two-dimensional brightness image. This example shows a phantom scan. You can see the B-mode image — it’s not as crystal clear as a CT or MRI image. There are speckles, some noise, and scattering effects. But you can still recognize the major anatomical structures.\n\nUltrasound transducers are cost-effective, small, and compact — that’s one of their biggest advantages. They can operate at high speed, producing real-time imaging. That’s B-mode scanning — simple, efficient, and very practical for clinical use.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
