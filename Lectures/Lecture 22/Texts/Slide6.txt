Alright, let’s move on. So, we’ve talked about A-mode and B-mode — now we come to the next one: M-mode. The letter M stands for motion.
M-mode is very similar to A-mode, but with one important difference. In A-mode, you send a pulse and get one amplitude profile at one point in time. In B-mode, you scan across space — one A-mode line after another — so the difference between two A-mode profiles represents a change in spatial location. You’re scanning across different positions or angles to build an image.

In M-mode, however, you stay at the same location — the same angle — and you repeatedly collect ultrasound signals over time. So instead of scanning across space, you’re scanning across time. What changes here are the internal structures that move, like the walls of a vessel or a heart chamber.
For example, imagine selecting a region of interest, such as part of the heart wall. As the heart beats, that wall expands and contracts. Even though the probe stays fixed, the echoes you receive from that region change over time. Each A-mode measurement gives you a one-dimensional profile, but now, because of motion, those profiles vary with every pulse. Sometimes the wall moves closer to the transducer; other times, it moves away.

If you keep recording these signals, you can build a motion profile. You can still display it as a two-dimensional image: the vertical axis represents depth — just like a typical A-mode — and the horizontal axis represents time. The result is a real-time record of motion. This is what we call motion mode, or M-mode.
It’s especially useful for studying moving organs, such as the beating heart, where you can visualize the rhythmic motion of cardiac walls and other dynamic structures over time.
