And I pause the wave, and I have two more ways to show you. So, let me just show you again. I hope the computer will not mess up. But I think good for you to see two more ways here. Just try. Okay. Okay. Try to pause the state, which means the reflector or surface does not have a

Let’s go a little deeper into how the pulsed wave behaves. Imagine you’re sending a sequence of pulses toward a target that is not moving. You send one pulse, two pulses, three pulses—each time the echo returns with the same amplitude and phase. If you line up all these received echoes at the same gated time instant, they all align perfectly. The phase remains constant, meaning the surface is stationary.

Now, let’s imagine a different case—one where the reflector is moving or oscillating back and forth. In that case, when you line up the received echoes, you’ll notice that their amplitudes and phases change from pulse to pulse. At a fixed gated time instant, the amplitude might be high for the first echo, lower for the second, and different again for the third. When you plot those amplitude values sequentially, they form a sinusoidal curve, representing a cyclic or oscillating motion.

If the target moves in a steady direction—say, a uniform motion instead of an oscillation—the resulting signal will not be sinusoidal but rather a linear change over time. So, each echo provides a single sampled data point from a given location, and by analyzing how those points evolve over a train of pulses, you can determine the relative motion of the scatterer or reflecting surface.

In your textbook, you’ll find several formulas that describe this mathematically, but the key idea is quite straightforward. The pulse wave mode works by collecting one data point from each returning echo at a fixed range. If there is no motion, the points stay constant; if there is motion, the points vary in amplitude or phase. By examining those variations, we can determine relative motion, which can then be related back to Doppler frequency and ultimately to velocity. However, if the object moves too fast, the returning echoes can overlap or become aliased, causing artifacts in the signal. This is one of the limits of the pulsed wave Doppler technique.
