I feel quite good today, moving into the second part of ultrasound imaging. After this lecture, we’ll teach the last imaging modality —optical imaging, in one lecture.

Now, we’ll follow the green textbook fairly closely. I strongly recommend that you read the chapter on ultrasound imaging — it’s about twenty-three pages long. If you read through the chapter carefully, you’ll have a very good understanding of everything we’re covering. I encourage you again to review or re-review that chapter, because it will really help you master today’s lecture.
