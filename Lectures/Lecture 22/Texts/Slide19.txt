The second part of this lecture focuses on dynamic imaging, particularly on how we measure motion, such as blood flow velocity or heart wall movement. To do this, we rely on the Doppler effect.

So, what exactly is the Doppler effect? It’s a physical principle that describes how the observed frequency of a wave changes when there is relative motion between the source and the observer. In ultrasound, this effect allows us to calculate how fast and in what direction blood is moving inside the body.
