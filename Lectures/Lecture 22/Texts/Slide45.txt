Alright, so this is the last slide for today. I’m not going to give you any regular homework, but it’s a good time for you to start reviewing or re-reviewing the ultrasound chapter — what I usually call the green chapter. For my classroom teaching, I want to take a moment to share a few thoughts about how traditional classroom learning compares with what we’re trying to do here.

Traditional teaching is often about knowledge transfer. In other words, you’re given a bunch of information — formulas, numbers, and rules — and you’re expected to become familiar with what other people have already done. You learn the steps, you can repeat them, you can reproduce the same results, and you can memorize the equations. There’s nothing wrong with that — it’s still a good foundation. But our goal goes a bit beyond that.
What I really want is to inspire you to have new ideas. To reach that point, you have to truly understand what’s going on beneath the surface. For example, when we studied the Doppler system earlier, I didn’t just want you to memorize the formula. I wanted you to see the reasoning behind it —to connect the physics to what you actually observe. That’s the kind of understanding that helps you innovate. We encourage you not to simply copy what others are doing. Don’t just see a bridge someone has built and make the same bridge again — instead, learn how to design your own. 

You need to create, to innovate, to generate something new. That’s far more important.
Now, when I talk about reviewing, we still use a closed-book or closed-form style of study. You can use the book, the slides, and the solutions. Even if you don’t understand every detail right away, I want you to read through the green chapter. Learn the concepts, understand the examples, and become familiar with the existing answers. 

At the same time, try to think hard where you can improve or add new functionality, such as iPhone-based possibilities.
You need to think beyond memorization — think about problem identification. When you review the material, try to notice how pioneers and earlier researchers identified their problems. How did they get their ideas? How did they use the tools available to them? Even if the textbook doesn’t directly give you an answer, you can always look for more — use Google Scholar, use Web of Science, explore the literature, and ask ChatGPT and other AI models. Learn to find what you need and to solve problems independently.

And finally, motivation matters. The traditional way of teaching doesn’t always emphasize new ideas or encourage creativity. But in real research, motivation drives discovery. That’s what I want to underline. So, when you review and study, don’t just focus on memorizing the content — look for the underlying meaning behind it. Try to understand the ideas, the motivation, and the reasoning that led to them.
So anyway — that’s all for today. Take some time to reflect, review the green chapter, and start thinking creatively about how you can connect what you’ve learned to new ideas. That’s how innovation really begins.
