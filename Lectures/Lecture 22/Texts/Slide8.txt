So that’s why we say: we have to use ultrasound transducer arrays. This will allow you to do parallel data acquisition. Parallel data acquisition is always desirable. And in the case of clinical—I said chiral—scenarios, faster imaging speed will reduce most artifacts and improve the report. So, a lot of good points to make.

There are many types of ultrasound transducers. You have a linear array; you can use it in different ways. You have this linear phased array. And there is a one-point-five-D array—so this is a one-dimensional array, but you have several one-dimensional rows; the number is not too big. If the number is very big—so the x- and y-directions are kind of symmetric—you have a truly 2-D array.

Phased means each ultrasound pixel—each element—does not fire in the same way. Each pixel you can think of as a source, as a vibrator. You can make a single piezoelectric material vibrate in the way you want. You can control the vibration with electrical signals through the so-called piezoelectric effect—the reaction plane. And once we have a two-dimensional array or a 1.5-D or 1-D array, each pixel—each transducer—can be individually controlled. 

With that individual control, we can freeze—computer. Let me see how to deal with it. Let me close the program. I will actually play a little bit with this. These are the reasons—I think a computer problem. This is the tool.
