Now, if you look at the images here, you’ll see what happens if the image registration between ultrasound and MRI is not done properly — the structures won’t line up, and the surgeon can’t accurately target the tumor. Without good alignment, it’s impossible to rely on the fused images for surgery.

To solve this, Dr. Yan’s team developed machine learning algorithms to automatically register ultrasound and MRI images. Using these intelligent registration techniques, the alignment quality improves dramatically — for example, in their results, the similarity index increases from about 0.24 to nearly 0.99. That’s a huge improvement.

With this level of precision, surgeons gain much higher confidence during the procedure, leading to better surgical outcomes. So this hybrid imaging approach — combining MRI’s high spatial resolution with ultrasound’s real-time imaging capability — represents a powerful direction for image-guided surgery. It’s a very active research area with many exciting developments and a strong clinical impact.

Next, we’ll look at another hybrid direction — combining ultrasound imaging with optical imaging.
