From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nToday, we’ll be covering the final imaging modality in our course—optical imaging. This topic isn’t included in the green textbook, so this lecture stands alone. Think of it as a story—one that unfolds step by step to show you how light can be used to visualize and analyze biological structures and functions.\n\nAs we go along, try to follow the flow of this story rather than memorizing isolated facts and details. Optical imaging combines fascinating principles from physics, biology, and engineering, and by learning how these ideas connect, you’ll develop a deep intuition for the topic.\n\nNow, let’s approach this lecture with curiosity. Enjoy the journey, stay engaged, and you’ll come away with a clear picture of how optical imaging works and why it plays such an important role in modern biomedical imaging.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Reject filler or administrative text.\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\n      \"term\": \"optical imaging\",\n      \"category\": \"modality\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"light can be used to visualize and analyze biological structures and functions\",\n      \"category\": \"modality\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"combines fascinating principles from physics, biology, and engineering\",\n      \"category\": \"physics\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"how these ideas connect\",\n      \"category\": \"algorithm\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"how optical imaging works\",\n      \"category\": \"modality\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"why it plays such an important role in modern biomedical imaging\",\n      \"category\": \"modality\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\n    \"Today, we’ll be covering the final imaging modality in our course—optical imaging.\",\n    \"Think of it as a story—one that unfolds step by step to show you how light can be used to visualize and analyze biological structures and functions.\",\n    \"Optical imaging combines fascinating principles from physics, biology, and engineering, and by learning how these ideas connect, you’ll develop a deep intuition for the topic.\",\n    \"Now,",
