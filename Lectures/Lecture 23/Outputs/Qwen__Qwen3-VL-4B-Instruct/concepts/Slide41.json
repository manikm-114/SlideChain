From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, some of the results reported in this area are quite interesting. In these experiments, the researchers scanned small animals — typically mice — sometimes for an entire day, to acquire very high-quality data.\n\nInstead of using conventional micro-CT, they used a grating-based phase-contrast tomography system. I actually mentioned this technique before, when we talked about my visit to Japan — the grating-based interferometric system. The setup uses a series of gratings — a source grating, a phase grating, and an analyzer grating — to measure very tiny changes in the X-ray phase as the beam passes through the sample.\n\nSo, what they did was essentially scan the animal — or tissue samples — using this grating-based X-ray phase-contrast CT. And they achieved beautiful soft-tissue visualization, something you simply can’t get from normal X-ray attenuation imaging.\n\nThese results, published by several European research groups, clearly demonstrated that grating-based phase-contrast tomography can reveal fine internal details — such as blood vessels, organ microstructures, and even tumor margins — without the need for any contrast agents.\nIt’s a big step forward for optical-X-ray fusion, because now the X-ray side of the hybrid system provides much richer anatomical detail to guide and constrain the optical reconstruction.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
