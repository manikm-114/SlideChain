From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nFirst step: be quantitative about how light propagates in tissue that is highly and strongly scattering. We decompose a piece of heterogeneous tissue into many small elements — in three dimensions, these are typically tetrahedra — and we assume each small element is uniform. Then we launch photons into the mesh and watch what happens.\n\nWhen a photon hits a boundary where optical properties change, it can reflect or transmit, with angles set by the physics. Once inside a region, it travels some distance, then scatters; all of these events are probabilistic. We use random number generators — this is the dice-rolling part — to decide whether a step reflects or transmits, how far the photon goes before the next interaction, and in what direction it scatters. We trace one photon step by step: maybe it reflects, maybe it refracts, maybe it travels, scatters, and then gets absorbed — good news and bad news, if it’s absorbed, you’re done with that photon. Or it might exit the tissue and reach a detector.\n\nThat’s the story for a single photon. Then you launch another photon. And another. You keep going — millions, even billions of photons — to build up statistics. This Monte Carlo approach lets you model refraction, reflection, scattering, absorption, and escape to the detector, all according to the measured or assumed light–tissue interaction properties. From those simulated detections, you can predict measurements and eventually tackle the inverse problem of forming an image in highly scattering tissue.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
