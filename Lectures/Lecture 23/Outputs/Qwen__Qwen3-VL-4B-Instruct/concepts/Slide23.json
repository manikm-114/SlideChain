From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nThis same principle is used in many important applications. One of the most famous examples is the Michelson Interferometer, which was not just used in imaging but also in fundamental physics experiments. In fact, it played a crucial role in shaping modern physics. The Michelson setup is just what we described — a beam splitter, a fixed mirror, and a movable mirror. Light travels along two paths, reflects back, and the interference pattern tells us how the path lengths differ. The optical path length difference is given by delta L equals two times the difference between L two and L one. The phase difference between the two beams is phi equals two pi delta L divided by lambda. And the detected intensity at the photodetector is given by I equals I one plus I two plus two times the square root of I one times I two times cosine phi.\n\nNow, if the two beams arrive in phase, meaning the optical path difference is an integer multiple of the wavelength, that gives constructive interference — maximum brightness. Mathematically, that happens when two pi delta L divided by lambda equals two m pi, or simply delta L equals m lambda, where m is an integer — zero, one, two, and so on. But if the path difference equals an odd multiple of half wavelengths — like delta L equals m plus one-half times lambda — then the waves cancel out, producing destructive interference, or darkness at the detector.\n\nWhat’s fascinating is that this same interferometer was used by Michelson and Morley in one of the most famous experiments in physics history. They wanted to test whether the speed of light changes depending on the motion of the Earth — whether it moves through something called the “ether.” The experiment was performed at Case Western University, and at that time, people expected to see a shift in the interference pattern as the apparatus rotated, meaning that light would travel slightly faster in one direction than another. But no shift was observed. The result was completely null. That means the speed of light was constant in all directions, independent of the motion of the source or the observer.\n\nThat single observation changed the world of physics. It showed that light doesn’t behave the way classical mechanics predicted. A few years later, Albert Einstein took that result and built his theory of Special Relativity around it — declaring the speed of light to be constant for all observers. So this simple optical instrument — based on the same interference principles we’ve been discussing — essentially marked the birth of modern physics. The Michelson Interferometer not only explains how OCT works, but also represents the bridge between classical and modern physics. It’s a truly beautiful piece of science — elegant, powerful, and revolutionary.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
