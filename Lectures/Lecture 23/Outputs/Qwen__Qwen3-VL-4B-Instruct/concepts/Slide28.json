From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLight diffusion is the heart of the third part. These third and fourth parts aren’t in common clinical use yet, but in research settings, they’re very active. With X-ray imaging, rays go essentially straight. Think of that purple straight line: the signal is a line integral along the path. Everything contributes additively, and you can explain it with the linear attenuation coefficient along that ray. Any change in the measurement must come from features located along that ray — that’s a strong localization claim, and it’s very clear.\n\nOptical imaging is different. Biological tissue scatters light strongly. I showed you that little cartoon of scattering — Rayleigh at small scales, Mie at larger ones — and you’ve all seen this in real life. In a dark room, shine a bright laser pointer and you see a diffuse glow. Put the laser behind your finger: can you see details behind the finger? No. With X-ray, the projection already looks like a picture. With optical light, even if you send a parallel laser beam, what you see is a cloudy smear. And yet, diffuse optical imaging says, despite that strong scattering, we still want to reconstruct an image.\n\nSo put it in simple words: we want to make a good image behind the finger. That sounds almost impossible, and it is hard. That’s why diffuse optical imaging is not as practical as X-ray and some other modalities. But optical interactions carry rich biological information, so we study them. Our job as engineers is to turn “impossible” into “feasible.” That’s the challenge — and that’s why we dig into diffusion models and inverse problems to see what can be recovered.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
