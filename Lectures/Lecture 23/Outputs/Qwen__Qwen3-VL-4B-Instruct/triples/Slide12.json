Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s take a look at something even more fun — the zoom lens.\u000bYou can see in this diagram and the photos on the right how the zoom lens works. It’s really cool. The zoom lens is designed so that by moving certain lens elements back and forth, you can continuously change the focal length. That means you can make the image appear closer or farther away without ever changing the focus on your object.\n\nHere you can see the different lens groups — usually labeled L1, L2, L3 — working together. When the internal lenses move relative to each other, the path of the light rays changes. The blue, yellow, and green paths you see here represent different light rays being bent and refocused as the lenses shift. By doing this, the system can magnify what you’re looking at — that’s the “zoom” part.\n\nSo, as you zoom in, you can magnify small details more and more. You start by seeing larger features, then zoom in again to reveal smaller and smaller structures — down to cellular or even sub-cellular levels, depending on the optical system. The magnifying power increases with each step, allowing you to explore fine details that are invisible to the naked eye.\nThat’s the basic idea behind zoom optics. It’s not just about bringing things closer — it’s about dynamically adjusting magnification while keeping the image in focus. And that ability to continuously zoom while maintaining clarity is one of the most powerful features of modern optical systems, especially in microscopy and photography.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
