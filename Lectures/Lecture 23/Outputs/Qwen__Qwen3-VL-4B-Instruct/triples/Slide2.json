Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAs you can see from our course schedule, today’s topic is Optical Imaging, listed here as Lecture 23. This is our final imaging modality in the sequence, coming right after the ultrasound sessions.  This lecture will connect what we’ve learned about other imaging techniques to the world of light-based imaging.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
