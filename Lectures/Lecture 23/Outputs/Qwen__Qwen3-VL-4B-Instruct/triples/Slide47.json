Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, we’ve been collaborating with General Electric — GE — to take this idea further.\nWith a micro-focused X-ray beam, we can excite nanophosphors deeply inside small animals, such as in the brain. You can imagine a setup like this: the X-ray beam enters an integrating sphere — that’s a spherical chamber lined with a highly reflective surface. It has just one small opening where the X-ray beam enters and where the emitted photons exit.\nHere’s how it works. The X-ray beam excites the nanophosphors in a very small region. Those nanophosphors emit optical photons — visible or near-infrared light. The integrating sphere reflects these photons multiple times — bouncing them around the inner wall — so that, eventually, almost every photon finds its way to the detector, usually a PMT, or photomultiplier tube. This design allows us to collect nearly all the emitted light with minimal loss.\nThat’s how we can do small-animal imaging efficiently.\n\nNow, if we scale up this concept, we can also envision doing human imaging, especially for the brain. The human cerebral cortex has about six layers, and together they’re roughly six millimeters thick. The interesting part — the one related to higher-level brain function and intelligence — lies not just on the surface, but deeper in those inner cortical layers.\nSo, how can we noninvasively reach those deeper layers? Well, one potential path is to use nanophosphors that can cross the blood–brain barrier and label specific neural structures. Then, we use a micro-focused X-ray beam to excite those particles deep inside the brain.\n\nHere’s where it gets really exciting — and, yes, a little bit like science fiction. When neurons fire, they produce action potentials — tiny electrical currents. These currents can interact with the nanophosphors, changing their quantum emission properties — for example, the color or intensity of the light they emit.\nSo in theory, by monitoring how the emitted light changes, we could infer neural activity — we could literally watch the brain think. Imagine detecting color changes corresponding to neural firing patterns!\n\nNow, I’m not saying we’re there yet — far from it. This is still in the conceptual stage. But it’s a very cool direction to pursue — combining X-ray excitation, optical emission, and nanophosphor sensing to probe deep brain function noninvasively. It’s futuristic, but scientifically grounded.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
