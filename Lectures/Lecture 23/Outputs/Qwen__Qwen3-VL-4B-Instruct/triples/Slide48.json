Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nLet’s shift gears and talk about another exciting technology — optogenetics.\nOptogenetics is a biological technique where light is used to control cells — typically neurons — that have been genetically modified to express light-sensitive ion channels. Depending on the wavelength of light you use, you can either activate or inhibit neural activity.\n\nFor example, blue light — around 470 nanometers — can open certain channels, allowing positively charged ions like sodium or calcium to enter the neuron, thereby triggering an electrical signal. On the other hand, yellow or red light — around 570 or 590 nanometers — can open other types of channels that inhibit activity, stopping the neuron from firing.\nSo, by simply changing the color of light, you can make a neuron fire or stop firing. It’s almost like using a remote control for the brain!\n\nResearchers have used this technique to study complex neurological conditions — things like depression, Parkinson’s disease, and addiction — where precise control of neural circuits is essential. You can shine light on specific regions of the brain and observe behavioral changes in animals — say, a mouse moving left when you use one color, or right when you use another.\n\nHowever, there’s a limitation. Optical light doesn’t penetrate deeply — it only reaches about one millimeter into tissue. If you want to reach deeper layers, you have to insert an optical fiber directly into the brain. And, of course, that’s invasive — it causes tissue damage, and you can’t easily use it for large-scale or long-term experiments.\nSo, while optogenetics is an incredibly powerful tool, its reach is still limited by the physics of light scattering.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
