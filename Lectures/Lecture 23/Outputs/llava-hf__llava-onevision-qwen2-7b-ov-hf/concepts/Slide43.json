From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAlright, in this last part, let’s talk about something quite new and exciting — X-ray optical coupling. If you look at the slide, you can see the last two names listed here: XLCT and XMLT. These stand for X-ray Luminescence Computed Tomography and X-ray Molecular Luminescence Tomography.\n\nNow, what we’re doing here is merging X-ray imaging and optical imaging — two worlds that traditionally don’t overlap much. But when you think about it, it makes perfect sense. X-rays penetrate deeply and travel straight, while optical imaging provides rich molecular and functional information. So, if we can somehow couple these two, we can get deep, high-resolution, molecularly sensitive images — the best of both worlds.\n\nSo this is what we mean by X-ray Optical Coupling — using X-rays to stimulate optical signals inside tissue, and then using those emitted optical photons to form an image. It’s a very elegant idea, and it’s starting to gain serious research attention.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
