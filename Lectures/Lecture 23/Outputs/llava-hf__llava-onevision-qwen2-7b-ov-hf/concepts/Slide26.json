From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s take that idea one step further. Suppose instead of imaging the eye, we use a tiny flexible optical fiber — the same kind of fiber used in telecommunications — and we put it inside the body. That’s exactly what’s done in intravascular OCT for cardiac studies. A miniature OCT probe is built right into a catheter — that’s the small tube used in heart procedures. This fiber can be guided through the blood vessels, all the way to the coronary arteries.\n\nOnce the probe is in place, OCT can scan the inside of the blood vessel, creating high-resolution images of the artery wall. With this, doctors can see if there’s a buildup of plaque, a blood clot, or any kind of blockage. They can even distinguish between different types of plaque — for example, whether it’s hard and calcified or soft and lipid-rich. This distinction is extremely important because soft, unstable plaques are the ones most likely to rupture and cause a heart attack.\n\nSo, using OCT, clinicians can visualize the inside of the heart’s arteries in real time, with microscopic precision — something that traditional imaging methods like X-ray angiography can’t show. It’s minimally invasive, it’s fast, and it provides information that’s both structural and functional.\n\nYou can think of this as doing an “optical biopsy” inside the blood vessel — without removing any tissue. This is why OCT has become such a powerful tool, not only in ophthalmology but also in cardiology and other clinical applications. It’s an elegant combination of physics, optics, and medicine — a simple idea, but a very powerful and precise technology that continues to transform how we see inside the human body.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
