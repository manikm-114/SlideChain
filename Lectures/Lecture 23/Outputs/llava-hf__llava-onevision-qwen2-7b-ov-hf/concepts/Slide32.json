From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s move to another branch — diffuse optical spectroscopy, or DOS. And yes, I know what some of you are thinking — DOS sounds like the old computer operating system. If you remember that, you’re not that young! But in this case, DOS stands for something different — diffuse optical spectroscopy.\nHere, we’re not trying to make an image. Instead, we’re doing spectral analysis — we shine light in, we collect what comes out, and we analyze the overall absorption and scattering to learn about the tissue’s composition.\n\nImagine my finger here. If I shine a broadband light — that means light with many colors — through my finger, different wavelengths will be absorbed differently. Blue light, for instance, is absorbed more strongly than red, which is why your finger looks red when you shine a flashlight through it.\n\nNow, by measuring how much light gets through at two or more wavelengths, we can solve for unknowns in the tissue. Usually, the main absorber in tissue is blood, and in blood, the key molecules are hemoglobin and oxyhemoglobin — that’s hemoglobin with oxygen bound to it. The ratio between those two forms gives us oxygen saturation, which is one of the most important physiological parameters for life.\n\nMathematically, it’s quite straightforward. The transmitted intensity follows Beer’s law — I equals I naught times e to the power of minus mu-a times L, where mu-a is the absorption coefficient and L is the path length. The absorption coefficient depends on how much hemoglobin and oxyhemoglobin are present and how strongly each absorbs light at that wavelength. By measuring intensity at two wavelengths, we can solve for two unknowns — the concentrations of Hb and HbO₂.\n\nIn fact, this is exactly the principle used in a pulse oximeter — that little clip you put on your finger in the hospital. It shines red and infrared light through your finger, measures how much of each gets through, and calculates oxygen saturation using this model.\n\nSo, this is diffuse optical spectroscopy. It doesn’t form an image, but it gives us valuable quantitative information — blood oxygen levels, water content, and even tissue metabolism. In a sense, it’s the simplest and most practical use of optical interaction with tissue — turning light absorption into a window on physiology. And the best part? It’s completely noninvasive — just light in, light out, and a bit of math in between.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
