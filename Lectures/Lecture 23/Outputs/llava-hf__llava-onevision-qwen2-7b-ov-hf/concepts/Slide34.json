From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nBut researchers don’t give up easily, right? They keep trying. And they’ve managed to make progress using infrared light, because infrared wavelengths are longer and scatter less than visible light. That gives you better penetration into tissue. So you can still get a measurable signal, even from deeper layers. And then, using some clever mathematical tricks, you can try to recover the internal absorption and scattering distribution — the actual optical properties inside the tissue.\n\nNow, think about how useful that could be. Suppose you have a tumor. In that region, the absorption and scattering characteristics will be different from the surrounding healthy tissue. Water content, fat content, and hemoglobin concentration — all these change when tissue becomes cancerous. For example, cancerous tissue tends to have more hemoglobin, because tumors grow new blood vessels to feed themselves — we call that angiogenesis. So, in optical terms, the tumor region is “hemoglobin-rich.”\n\nSo, people have written many papers using this principle. Under certain experimental conditions, the results do make sense — the reconstructed maps of hemoglobin concentration and oxygenation often agree with what’s seen in pathology. You might see a region with higher hemoglobin absorption — that’s where the tumor is. It’s exciting work. But the question remains: has it reached clinical use? Not really — at least, not yet.\n\nAfter many years of research, diffuse optical tomography is still not mature. The principle is solid, the physics is beautiful, but the system is what we call ill-posed — the solutions are unstable, sensitive to noise, and dependent on assumptions. It’s just not as robust or reliable as X-ray imaging.\nAnd that’s an important comparison. We’re all very proud of our X-ray imaging technology. Every hospital depends on it — CT, fluoroscopy, mammography — they’re all part of daily clinical life. If you took X-ray imaging away from a hospital, they’d practically have to close their doors! It’s that critical. So when you ask a doctor, “If you could only keep one imaging modality in your clinic, which would it be?” — none of them will pick optical imaging. \n\nThey’ll all say, “We’ll keep X-ray.” That’s the truth.\nSo, yes — optical tomography is very interesting. It’s innovative, and it provides functional and molecular information that X-rays can’t. But it’s still a research tool. X-rays, on the other hand, are robust, quantitative, and universally trusted in clinical medicine. That’s where we stand today.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
