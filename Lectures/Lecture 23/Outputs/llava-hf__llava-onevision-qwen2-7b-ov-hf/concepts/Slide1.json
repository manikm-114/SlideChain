From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nToday, we’ll be covering the final imaging modality in our course—optical imaging. This topic isn’t included in the green textbook, so this lecture stands alone. Think of it as a story—one that unfolds step by step to show you how light can be used to visualize and analyze biological structures and functions.\n\nAs we go along, try to follow the flow of this story rather than memorizing isolated facts and details. Optical imaging combines fascinating principles from physics, biology, and engineering, and by learning how these ideas connect, you’ll develop a deep intuition for the topic.\n\nNow, let’s approach this lecture with curiosity. Enjoy the journey, stay engaged, and you’ll come away with a clear picture of how optical imaging works and why it plays such an important role in modern biomedical imaging.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"optical imaging\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"physics\", \"category\": \"physics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"biological structures\", \"category\": \"anatomy\"},\n    {\"term\": \"modern biomedical imaging\", \"category\": \"modality\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"This topic isn’t included in the green textbook, so this lecture stands alone.\", \"Optical imaging combines fascinating principles from physics, biology, and engineering, and by learning how these ideas connect, you’ll develop a deep intuition for the topic.\"]\n}\n```",
