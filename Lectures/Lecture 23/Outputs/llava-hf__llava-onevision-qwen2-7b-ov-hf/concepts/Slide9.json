From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAlright, now let’s take a moment to look at something simple and familiar — the optical lens.\u000bYou’ve seen these before: there are two basic types of lenses — converging lenses and diverging lenses. I think most of you learned this back in high school, right? Maybe in Physics II, or in your earlier science classes. No? Well, in any case, this is something that every student should know at least conceptually, and if you don’t, that’s perfectly fine — we’ll go through it together now.\n\nSo, here’s the basic idea. When you send in a parallel beam of light into a converging lens, the rays bend, or refract, toward each other and meet at a single point called the focal point. For a diverging lens, it’s the opposite — the rays spread apart after passing through the lens. If you trace those diverging rays backward, they seem to come from a single point on the same side of the lens — that’s the virtual focal point.\n\nNow, how do we actually form an image using these light rays? Let’s think about a simple example. If you have a real object in front of a converging lens, a ray parallel to the optical axis will bend and pass through the focal point on the other side. Another ray that passes through the optical center of the lens continues in a straight line, unchanged in direction. Where those two rays meet, that’s where the image forms. This is what we call ray tracing, and it’s a fundamental rule of geometrical optics.\n\nThe trick to making this work lies in the curvature of the lens surfaces. If you design the curvature properly, you can make all the parallel beams focus precisely at the same point. Usually, we approximate the surface as spherical when the lens is thin — that’s why it’s called the thin lens approximation. So as long as the curvature is correct and the lens is thin, parallel rays will converge or diverge exactly as expected.\n\nThere’s also an important rule here: when a light ray passes through the optical center — the very middle of the lens — its direction does not change. It just goes straight through. That’s one of the key rules for tracing rays. Another important principle is reversibility — light follows the same path backward and forward. So, if a ray travels from the object through the lens to form an image, the light could just as easily travel the opposite way, from that image point back through the lens to the object.\n\nIf you take the time to think about it carefully, this all makes sense geometrically. The symmetry of the two curved surfaces ensures that when a ray passes through the center, the small refraction at one surface is canceled by the opposite refraction at the other, keeping the ray direction unchanged. That’s why it goes straight through without bending. All these properties — convergence, divergence, optical center, and reversibility — together form the essential rules for understanding how lenses create images.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
