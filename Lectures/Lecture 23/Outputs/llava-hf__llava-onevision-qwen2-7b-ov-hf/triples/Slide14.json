Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nIf you’re interested, you can click the link on this slide to watch an actual cell division video.\u000bWhat you’re seeing in that video is an image captured using the confocal microscopy principle that we just talked about. The image clearly shows living cells dividing, and the red-colored regions represent the nuclei or specific fluorescent markers that have been tagged so we can visualize the process in real time.\n\nThis is a great example of how confocal microscopy works in practice. The technology was so revolutionary that it became one of the most important tools in biological research. It’s amazing to think that this entire concept — scanning one point at a time through a small aperture to reject out-of-focus light — came from an idea developed when its inventor was still a PhD student. It shows how a simple but brilliant idea can completely change the way we see the microscopic world.\n\nEven though the confocal microscope may seem common today, the design is still considered incredibly clever. It’s a perfect example of elegant engineering — combining optical precision with computational reconstruction to produce crisp, high-resolution images of living cells. Watching something as fundamental as a cell dividing, in real time, is truly fascinating. It reminds us how powerful and insightful optical imaging can be.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
