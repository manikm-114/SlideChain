Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAlright, that brings us to the end of today’s lecture.\n\nFor homework, I’d like you to do three things:\nFirst, review this lecture carefully and summarize the key ideas — not just a quick summary, but really try to capture the main concepts and how they connect.\nSecond, transcribe one section of this lecture — you can pick the first part, the second part, or the last two parts — and write it down clearly. This will help reinforce your understanding.\nAnd third, here’s a fun one — a creative thinking question. Imagine you could make a smartphone that can send and receive light in any way you want. What kind of medical imaging applications could you create?\n\nThink about it — a smartphone already has a light source, a detector, computing power, and connectivity. What if it could emit polarized light, or detect fluorescence, or measure oxygen levels through tissue? Could it monitor glucose levels? Could it perform optical tomography?\n\nYou can be as creative as you want — just stay within the limits of physics.\nSo, that’s your assignment: review, transcribe, and imagine. I’m really looking forward to seeing your ideas. And that’s all for today — thank you!\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"review\", \"p\":\"uses\", \"o\":\"summary\", \"modalities\":[\"text\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"Review carefully and summarize the key ideas.\"}\n  ]\n}",
