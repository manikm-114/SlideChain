Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, another important topic I want to mention is optical fiber.\u000bHere you can see how light travels through the fiber — the structure has a core made of a material with a high refractive index, surrounded by a cladding with a lower refractive index. This design is intentional because it causes the light traveling inside the core to undergo total internal reflection. Every time the light hits the boundary between the core and cladding, it reflects back in, staying trapped inside the fiber.\n\nThe result is that the light — and the energy it carries — can travel a long distance without significant loss. So, you can think of the optical fiber as a very efficient light guide. It delivers light, or an optical signal, from one point to another with minimal attenuation, even over long distances and through curved paths. It’s a beautiful example of using the laws of physics — in this case, total internal reflection — for practical engineering.\n\nNow, imagine you place this kind of fiber inside the body, say along the heart wall or into a living tissue. The optical fiber can both transmit light and collect light that’s reflected or emitted back from the tissue. In the schematic below, you see a pair of fibers — one for transmitting and one for receiving. The transmitted light excites or illuminates the target region, and the returning signal is collected and carried back through the receiving fiber.\n\nThis setup is the foundation for optical biopsy and miniaturized confocal microscopy. Using fiber optics, we can bring the principles of confocal microscopy directly inside a living organism — even inside a human patient. That means we can perform microscopic imaging in vivo, observing tissues at the cellular level without the need for large or invasive instruments. So optical fibers not only deliver signals; they open the door to new types of medical imaging that can look inside the body in ways that were impossible before.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
