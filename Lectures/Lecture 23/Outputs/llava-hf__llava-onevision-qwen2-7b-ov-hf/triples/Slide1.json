  "raw_output": "user \nSystem:\nYou are extracting factual relations from a medical imaging lecture. Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nToday, we’ll be covering the final imaging modality in our course—optical imaging. This topic isn’t included in the green textbook, so this lecture stands alone. Think of it as a story—one that unfolds step by step to show you how light can be used to visualize and analyze biological structures and functions.\n\nAs we go along, try to follow the flow of this story rather than memorizing isolated facts and details. Optical imaging combines fascinating principles from physics, biology, and engineering, and by learning how these ideas connect, you’ll develop a deep intuition for the topic.\n\nNow, let’s approach this lecture with curiosity. Enjoy the journey, stay engaged, and you’ll come away with a clear picture of how optical imaging works and why it plays such an important role in modern biomedical imaging.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"optical imaging\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"biological structures and functions\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"This topic isn’t included in the green textbook, so this lecture stands alone.
