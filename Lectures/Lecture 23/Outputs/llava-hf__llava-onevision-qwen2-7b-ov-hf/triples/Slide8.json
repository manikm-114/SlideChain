Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s talk about bioluminescence. So, what exactly is bioluminescence?\u000bYou’ve probably seen it yourself — on a summer night when the air is warm and the grass is glowing here and there with tiny flashing lights. Those little bugs you see flying around with glowing tails — fireflies — are perfect examples of bioluminescent creatures. Or, if you’ve ever been near the ocean at night, sometimes you can see a faint glow in the water — that’s also bioluminescence, produced by microscopic marine organisms.\n\nSo bioluminescence simply means light that is produced by a living organism. It’s very similar in appearance to fluorescence — both involve light emission from certain molecules or proteins — but the mechanism is quite different. In fluorescence, you must first shine an external light, such as a laser or lamp, to excite the molecules, and then they emit light as they relax back to their original energy state. But in bioluminescence, you don’t have to do anything at all. The organism itself produces light through a chemical reaction that happens naturally inside its body. No laser, no excitation source — just spontaneous light emission.\n\nThink of those insects again: they’re not being “shined on” by any light source, yet you can clearly see them glowing green or pink as they fly. That’s bioluminescence — living creatures generating visible light on their own. It’s sometimes called cold light, because it doesn’t involve heat like a light bulb does.\n\nFrom the imaging point of view, this phenomenon is extremely useful. Scientists can isolate the light-emitting proteins from these organisms — the so-called bioluminescent proteins — and then combine them with other target molecules, such as specific genes or cancer markers. When those target genes are expressed in cells, the bioluminescent signal becomes visible. In other words, if a cancer cell expresses a certain gene, it will literally light up — allowing us to observe biological processes directly, inside living tissue.\n\nSo, thanks to optical imaging, we can now visualize biological activity in vivo, meaning within a living organism, in real time. This is a major step forward for modern biomedical research. Bioluminescence, like fluorescence, represents another important form of light–tissue interaction — one where living systems themselves emit light through molecular mechanisms. In the next part, we’ll discuss how we can use these natural light-emitting processes to actually perform imaging.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
