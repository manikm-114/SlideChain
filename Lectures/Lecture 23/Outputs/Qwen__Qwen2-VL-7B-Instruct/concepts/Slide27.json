From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nOkay, how are we doing on time? We’ve wrapped up the second part, and now we’ll continue into the third and fourth parts. In the first part I walked you through the key ideas. We talked about optical microscopy and the confocal idea — a wonderful idea. No Nobel Prize there, unlike OCT, but still pretty amazing. Then we looked at how interference lets you do imaging — not only optical coherence tomography, but interferometric imaging in general. The principle itself is profound, even when there isn’t a Nobel attached to it.\n\nYou may have read the news about gravitational wave detection. How do they detect those waves? The waves create tiny vibrations — unbelievably small — that you would think are impossible to measure. The trick is interferometry. Two long arms, miles long, two optical paths that pick up a minute difference, and that difference is magnified by interference. There are setups in the United States and Europe, and even programs in China. Some people are pushing to use satellites to make the arms even longer. Interferometry is incredibly helpful whenever you have wave behavior and you want extremely precise measurements.\n\nSo the two ideas — confocal microscopy and optical coherence tomography — sit inside this larger family of interferometric imaging. It’s not only optical; X-rays and even gravitational wave observatories use the same core idea. In the end, it all goes back to adding waves: cosine omega t plus cosine omega t plus phi. That simple concept has powered multiple Nobel-level advances. Now, let’s turn to something different: diffuse optical imaging. You may not know these methods yet, but you will.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
