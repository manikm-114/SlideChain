From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nOkay, so let’s go a bit deeper into the physics and materials behind this idea. This concept really reminds me of how fluorescent and bioluminescent proteins work. In fluorescence imaging, you have a fluorophore — say, a protein that absorbs one color of light and emits another. In bioluminescence, you have a chemical reaction that produces light on its own, like fireflies.\n\nNow, what researchers have done is introduce a new type of material, called a nanophosphor — it’s not a protein, not biological by nature, but rather an engineered material. Nanophosphors are nanoscale particles that have unique luminescent properties.\nHere’s how it works. When you shine an X-ray beam onto these nanophosphors, they emit visible or near-infrared light — in other words, they glow. You can even make different kinds of nanophosphors that emit different colors — green, red, near-infrared, far-infrared — depending on the specific material and dopant you use.\nSo, it’s very much in parallel with fluorescence imaging, except for one big difference: in fluorescence, you excite the molecules using laser light, which is itself light, and therefore it scatters heavily inside tissue. But in this case, the excitation comes from X-rays, which travel straight through the body. So, the spatial resolution is much better because X-rays are not affected by scattering the way light is.\n\nOne example of this can be seen in the study shown here — Photostimulated Near-Infrared Persistent Luminescence as a New Optical Readout from Chromium-Doped Lithium Gallium Oxide. This material, when irradiated by X-rays, stores the energy and then later emits near-infrared light when stimulated by low-energy light.\nThis concept — using X-ray-excitable nanophosphors — opens the door to a completely new kind of optical imaging. Instead of laser excitation, we use X-rays, and the resulting emitted light can be collected optically. That’s the core idea behind X-ray Optical Coupling.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
