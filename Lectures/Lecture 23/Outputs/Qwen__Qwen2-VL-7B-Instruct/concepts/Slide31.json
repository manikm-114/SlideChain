From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s talk about what happens at a quantitative level — how photons actually move through scattering media like tissue. When light enters tissue, it doesn’t travel far before it gets scattered, because the medium is highly scattering. Statistically, we describe this using something called the mean free path. The mean free path is the average distance a photon travels before being scattered. For biological tissue, that’s typically on the order of one-tenth of a millimeter — a very short distance.\n\nBelow that distance, we say the photons are in the ballistic region — they travel almost straight, like X-rays, without scattering much. But once they start scattering, things get complicated. The direction changes slightly with each scattering event, and after several scatterings, the photon is completely randomized.\n\nThat’s why X-ray imaging works so well — the X-rays go straight, so you know exactly which direction they came from. But in optical imaging, photons quickly lose that directional information. You detect a photon, but you can’t tell whether it came directly from your target or if it was scattered off several other structures first. It’s like hearing an echo in a cave — you know sound reached you, but you don’t know exactly from where.\n\nTo describe this loss of directionality, we use another parameter called the transport mean free path. After traveling one transport mean free path, the photon’s direction has essentially been randomized — it has lost all memory of where it came from. In typical biological tissue, this distance is about one millimeter.\n\nThat means that within the first millimeter, you can still recover some useful information — that’s where diffuse optical imaging and near-infrared spectroscopy operate. But beyond that depth, it becomes extremely challenging. You lose the ability to form high-resolution images because photons have wandered too much. It’s not totally impossible, but it’s very hard. That’s one of the fundamental physical limits of optical imaging.\n\nSo to summarize: photons in tissue move only about a tenth of a millimeter before scattering, and after about a millimeter, their paths are completely randomized. That’s why optical imaging is powerful for shallow structures — like the cortex, or the retina — but much more difficult for deep tissue imaging. Later, we’ll see how researchers combine optics with X-rays to overcome that limitation.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
