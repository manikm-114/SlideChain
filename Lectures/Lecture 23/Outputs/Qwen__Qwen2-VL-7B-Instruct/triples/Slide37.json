Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAlright, so here we can see an example of what’s called FMT reconstruction, meaning fluorescence molecular tomography reconstruction. You can see the image of the animal here — this is usually a mouse, and we’ve done the imaging after injecting fluorescent probes. So, you collect the signals from different views, and then you reconstruct a 3D distribution of those fluorescent signals inside the body.\n\nNow, some research groups — and I’ve seen quite a few papers like this — claim that they can do very high-quality reconstruction. And yes, to a certain degree, they can. These results look pretty good, and they do show useful biological information. But, to be honest, the results are still not very reliable yet. The reconstruction quality is limited by noise, by the scattering of light, and by how well the model matches the real tissue.\n\nIf you look at this picture, you can see the 3D reconstructed image with color bars on the right side. The colors correspond to different levels of fluorescent intensity. So, when you look at the image, you get a sense of where the fluorescent probe has accumulated inside the animal’s body. This helps identify regions of biological activity — for example, where a particular enzyme is expressed, or where a drug is localized.\nThis example shows a three-dimensional reconstruction of fluorescence molecular tomography — FMT. So, yes, it’s a practical imaging modality, and it really works, but it’s not for human use. There are a few reasons for that.\n\nFirst, most of the fluorescent probes used in small-animal imaging are not safe for human use — they’re either toxic or not approved for clinical injection. Second, there’s a size issue — humans are much bigger than mice, and optical light simply cannot penetrate that deeply into human tissue. The penetration depth of laser light is very limited.\nSo, for now, FMT is mainly a preclinical imaging technique — something that’s used in research, mostly for small animals. It’s great for drug development, molecular biology, and early disease studies, but not yet practical for clinical imaging in humans.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
