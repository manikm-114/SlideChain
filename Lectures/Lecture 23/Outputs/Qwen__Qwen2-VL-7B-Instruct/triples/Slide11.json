Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere we can see some examples of actual lenses used in optical systems.\u000bThese are the real-world components that apply all those rules we just discussed. You can see lenses of different shapes and sizes — convex, concave, cylindrical, plano-convex, biconvex, and so on. Each type has a specific purpose, but all follow the same physical principles of light refraction and focusing.\n\nIf you’re patient enough to spend time studying these lenses, you’ll find that the underlying physics is straightforward and elegant. What’s fascinating is how we can shape these pieces of glass to control light precisely — to focus it, spread it, or redirect it any way we want.\n\nIn fact, working with lenses can be quite enjoyable. When you actually draw ray diagrams and see them align perfectly, it’s like creating a piece of art. In optical labs, researchers and engineers spend a lot of time polishing lenses and adjusting their curvature to make sure light behaves exactly as intended. It’s a combination of science and craftsmanship.\n\nSo, remember — even though the optical principles are simple, mastering them opens up an entire world of imaging technology. Everything from microscopes to cameras to telescopes depends on these very same ideas of ray tracing and lens design.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
