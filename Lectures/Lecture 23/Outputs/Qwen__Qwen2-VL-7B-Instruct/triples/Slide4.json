Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, let’s begin our story — and at the beginning, there is light.\n\u000bLight is part of the electromagnetic, or EM, wave spectrum, which spans an enormous range of wavelengths. We’ve already talked about the shorter wavelengths, such as gamma rays used in nuclear imaging and X-rays used in computed tomography. On the other end, we have radio waves and microwaves, which are much longer and used in applications like MRI and even cooking.\n\nVisible light, however, occupies only a very narrow portion of this vast spectrum. Specifically, it ranges roughly from 400 nanometers to about 1,000 nanometers in wavelength. Within this band, our eyes perceive different colors — violet, blue, green, yellow, and red — depending on the wavelength. You’ve seen this effect when light passes through a prism, spreading into a rainbow of colors.\n\nSome animals can detect wavelengths beyond our range. For example, certain species can see ultraviolet or even X-ray light, as confirmed by electroretinogram studies. Among humans, individual sensitivity also varies, and a small percentage of people are color-blind, perceiving only shades of gray.\n\nFor medical imaging, each modality uses a different part of the spectrum depending on its purpose. In optical imaging, we focus on the portion we can directly see — the visible and near-infrared range. These wavelengths penetrate tissue to a useful depth, making them ideal for studying cells, tissues, and biological processes using light. Understanding this basic physical foundation will help you appreciate how optical imaging works and why it’s such a powerful technique.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
