Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, let’s move on and talk about fluorescence molecular tomography — often abbreviated as FMT. Fluorescence and bioluminescence imaging are both very important tools, because they allow us to use fluorescent or luminescent probes to label biological molecules — like proteins, genes, or even drugs — so we can track them in real time.\nMost of the time, we use small animal models for this. Small animals — mice, rats — are used to model almost all kinds of human diseases. We don’t want to experiment directly on humans, of course, so we test our ideas on these animals first. We give them certain diseases — cancer, bone degeneration, inflammation, all sorts of things — and then we test how treatments work.\n\nOnce the biological principles look promising, we test drugs on these animal models to see if they behave as expected before we move on to human trials.\nSo, for example, suppose we label cancer cells with a red fluorescent protein. Then we label a drug molecule — maybe an antibody or some therapeutic compound — with a green fluorescent marker. Now, if the green-labeled drug binds to the red-labeled cancer cells, that means the drug has successfully targeted the tumor. In that case, the red signal would decrease or disappear, and we could monitor that process in vivo, meaning inside the living animal, in real time.\n\nThat’s the beauty of fluorescence molecular tomography — we can visualize biological processes directly, without opening the body.\nNow, if you look at the illustration here, you see the setup. The animal is standing upright, which is not really a physiological position — ideally, the animal should be lying down to minimize stress. But this figure is just to show the principle of the system.\n\nInside the animal, suppose both the cancer cells and the drug molecules are labeled with different fluorescent proteins — maybe blue, green, yellow, or red, depending on what we want to track. At first, you might not see any fluorescence signal on the surface. But then, we shine in a femtosecond laser beam — that’s an extremely short, high-intensity pulse of light — at a specific wavelength. That excites the fluorescent molecules inside the body.\n\nThose molecules then emit light at longer wavelengths — that’s the fluorescence emission. We collect those emission signals using an optical detector, usually a highly sensitive ICCD camera — that’s an intensified charge-coupled device.\nNow, the emission filter plays a very important role. It blocks the excitation light — the laser light that we sent in — and only allows the emitted fluorescent light to pass through. This way, we measure only the signal that comes from the fluorescence, not the original illumination beam.\nSo, in the end, you get a set of projection views — one from each rotation angle — just like a CT scan. You rotate the animal, collect data from multiple views, and reconstruct a 3D distribution of fluorescent activity inside the body.\n\nOf course, it’s not as straightforward as CT, because light in tissue is highly scattered, so the reconstruction problem is much harder — not very stable, not very unique, and sensitive to noise. But still, you can get useful information by combining advanced algorithms and multiple measurements.\nSo this system — using a femtosecond laser, a rotating stage, and an ICCD detector — is an example of fluorescence molecular tomography in small animals. It’s a powerful tool for biological and pharmaceutical research, allowing us to visualize how drugs move, how genes express, and how diseases progress — all in a living system.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
