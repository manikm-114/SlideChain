Alright, now the second idea here is what I call the tiredly idea — it’s really a continuation of the first part. We want to do tomography. We really want to do tomography — just like we do X-ray tomography. So, let’s think about how we actually do X-ray or gamma-ray tomography.
In those systems, you send a pencil beam — a narrow, collimated beam — straight through the object. What you measure is basically a line integral. For nuclear imaging, it’s sometimes a quasi-line integral because the photons are affected by an attenuation kernel, but fundamentally, the information you get comes from along that single line.

So, you get one line-integral measurement, and that becomes one linear system equation. In that equation, all the unknowns — those pixel or voxel values — are weighted according to how much of the beam passes through each small region. That weighting is the fraction of the path that cuts through each voxel. So, mathematically, it’s like this: one unknown times its weighting factor, plus another unknown times its weighting factor, plus another, and so on — all along that beam line. That gives you one linear equation.
Now you can see how this builds up. You have many, many linear equations — one for each ray, one for each angle. The weighting factors are all known because they come from the imaging geometry — the way you arrange your source and detector. The only unknowns are all those mu values — the attenuation coefficients inside each pixel or voxel — which we call mu one, mu two, mu three, and so on.

Now, how does this relate to the Beer–Lambert law? Let’s go back to that. You have an incoming intensity, called I naught, and you measure an outgoing intensity, I. According to Beer’s law, the transmitted intensity equals the input intensity multiplied by e to the power of negative mu times delta, where mu is the attenuation coefficient, and delta is the distance through that small region.
So, suppose the beam passes through one region with attenuation mu one and thickness delta one, then into a second region with mu two and thickness delta two, and so on. After the first region, the output of that layer becomes the input for the next. Multiply all those together, and inside the exponential, you get the total, negative the sum of mu times delta over all the layers.

So mathematically, we say I equals I naught times e to the power of minus the sum of mu times delta. That’s what we measure. Now, if we take the natural logarithm of both sides, it becomes linear. Log of I naught over I equals the sum of mu times delta. That’s the key point: each measurement gives you one linear equation in the unknown mu values.
All the geometry — those delta distances — are known, and the intensities I and I naught are measured. So that’s how we form the reconstruction problem for tomography.
Now, this all works nicely for X-ray imaging, where photons travel in straight lines. But in optical tomography, things are very different. When we send optical light into biological tissue, we still have all those local attenuation coefficients, all those mu’s — but the light doesn’t travel straight. It scatters everywhere. So we can’t just send one clean laser beam, measure on the other side, and call that a line integral. The light spreads out in all directions, taking many different paths.

Each measurement still has weighting factors, but now those weighting factors are far more complicated because the light is diffusing rather than traveling straight. And when we add up all those equations, they still look linear in the unknown mu’s, but all the equations start to look very similar to one another. That’s the main problem.
It’s like this: suppose you have three unknowns — x, y, and z. And all your equations look like x plus y plus z equals one. Then the next one says x plus y plus z equals one point zero zero one. Then another says x plus y plus z equals zero point nine nine nine. You have a lot of measurements, yes, but they’re almost identical. You can’t solve for x, y, and z because the equations don’t give you independent information.

In tomography, we call that an ill-posed problem. You have a lot of data, but not enough unique or independent information to get a stable solution.
So the analogy here is that in optical tomography, all the light measurements look very similar because scattering smears out the information. Each detector sees a blurred, mixed-up version of everything inside. The equations are still linear — yes, still linear — but they’re all nearly the same, so it becomes very difficult to separate one unknown from another.
And that’s the essence of the challenge. Too much diffusion means too little unique information. That’s why optical tomography is so difficult. It’s mathematically ill-posed, physically diffusive, and highly sensitive to noise. The principle is beautiful, but the reconstruction is tricky.
