Now, let’s summarize what we just discussed by looking at the rules for ray tracing.There are a few simple but very important rules that describe how light behaves when passing through a lens. Rule number one says that a ray passing through the center of a lens will not be deflected — it keeps its direction. This happens because the lens is symmetric, and the small amount of bending at one surface is canceled by an equal and opposite bending at the other. So, any ray that goes right through the center remains straight.

Rule number two tells us that rays parallel to the optical axis will converge to the focal point on the opposite side after passing through a converging lens, or will appear to come from a focal point on the same side in the case of a diverging lens. And if you reverse the process — sending rays from the focal point through the lens — they’ll come out parallel to the optical axis. This is a beautiful symmetry and is very useful when tracing images.

Then we have rule number three, which extends that idea. Parallel rays entering the lens at different angles all meet at a single focal plane after refraction. This rule also works in reverse. These three rules are the foundation of geometrical optics, and with them, you can quickly predict where and how an image forms.

So, when you combine these ideas, you can understand how a real image forms with a converging lens — the rays physically meet at a point on the opposite side. For a diverging lens, the rays spread apart, and the image appears to form on the same side as the object — that’s a virtual image. These concepts are very simple once you visualize how the rays travel.
