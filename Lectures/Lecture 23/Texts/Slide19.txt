Alright, now let’s go back a little bit. This part is some trigonometry stuff, okay? So just follow me step by step. Suppose you have one wave — I’ll call it y one equals a cosine omega t. That’s your first wave. Then you have another wave, same amplitude, but traveling a slightly different optical path. That one is y two equals a cosine omega t plus phi.
Now, this phi is the phase shift — it tells us how much the second wave is delayed compared to the first one. When these two waves come back together and recombine, they won’t be perfectly in sync anymore. Because the optical paths are different, there’s a small phase difference between them.

Now, when you add these two waves together — that’s what happens inside the OCT interferometer — the total wave is the sum of those two cosine terms. So, mathematically, y equals y one plus y two equals a cosine omega t plus a cosine omega t plus phi.
Now, we can simplify that using a trigonometric identity. You might remember this one: cos A plus cos B equals two times cosine of A plus B divided by two, multiplied by cosine of A minus B divided by two. So if we apply that to our case, A is omega t, and B is omega t plus phi. Plugging that in, we get this: y equals two a cosine phi over two, times cosine omega t plus phi over two. Let me say that clearly — y equals two a cosine phi over two times cosine omega t plus phi over two.
Now look — the amplitude of this combined wave depends on phi, the phase difference. That means as phi changes, the amplitude changes. So, a phase change directly changes the amplitude we measure.

Now here’s another important point. In real optical systems, we can’t measure the electric field itself — the light oscillates way too fast, hundreds of trillions of times per second. What we can measure is intensity. And intensity is proportional to the square of the amplitude.
So let’s take that amplitude — two a cosine phi over two — and square it. That gives us intensity proportional to two times a cosine phi over two squared. Or, in simpler words, I equals four a squared cosine squared phi over two. Let me repeat that slowly so you can hear it clearly — I equals four a squared cosine squared phi over two.
Now, a squared term is just the reference intensity. We usually call that I naught. So when we replace a squared with I naught, we get the final formula: I equals four I naught cosine squared phi over two. That’s the key relationship. I equals four I naught cosine squared phi over two.

Now, let’s think about what that really means. Even a tiny change in phi — a tiny phase shift — can cause a big change in intensity because of that cosine squared term. If phi equals zero, meaning the two waves are perfectly in phase, the cosine of zero is one, and the intensity is maximum — four times I naught. If phi equals one hundred eighty degrees, meaning the waves are half a wavelength out of phase, the cosine of ninety degrees is zero, and the intensity drops all the way to zero.
So, with just a small phase change — half a wavelength — the brightness goes from full to completely dark. That’s interference. That’s how powerful this relationship is. Now, remember, the wavelength of light is extremely small — around four hundred to one thousand nanometers. That means this interference can detect changes in optical path length on the order of nanometers. That’s unbelievably precise.

So, the big idea here is that a small change in phase produces a measurable change in amplitude — or in the brightness that we detect. That’s the fundamental principle of OCT. And this intensity, I, is modulated by cosine squared phi over two. So as phi changes — from zero to three hundred sixty degrees — the intensity goes from bright to dark and back again. That creates an interference fringe pattern.

Those bright and dark fringes are what we analyze in OCT. Each fringe corresponds to a small change in path length, and by counting or analyzing those fringes, we can calculate the depth with extremely high accuracy — down to micrometers or even nanometers.

So, remember this equation — I equals four I naught cosine squared phi over two. That’s the one you want to keep in mind. It’s the bridge between phase change and amplitude change. And that’s the beauty of optical coherence — we can’t see the phase directly, but we can measure the amplitude. The change in brightness tells us how the phase has shifted.
That’s why OCT is such a precise imaging technique. Two beams — one reference, one sample — recombine, interfere, and the resulting intensity pattern gives us incredibly fine depth information. So again, the simple rule: a small change in phase leads to a measurable change in amplitude. That’s the essence of optical coherence tomography.
