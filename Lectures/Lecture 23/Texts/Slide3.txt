Today’s lecture on optical imaging will be divided into four main parts.We’ll begin with optical microscopy, which is the foundation of optical imaging. This remarkable technology was the first to let us see individual cells and even cell division — truly a revolutionary step in science. In this part, we’ll discuss the basic idea of visible light as a segment of the electromagnetic wave and how it interacts with biological tissues. Understanding these optical and tissue properties gives us the foundation we need for everything that follows.

Next, we’ll move to optical coherence tomography, or OCT. I’ll explain its basic principle — a fascinating concept based on light interference — and show you some of its clinical applications. While optical microscopy dominates biology labs, OCT is widely used in medical settings, especially in eye clinics. These two methods — microscopy and OCT — are the most established optical imaging techniques with real clinical and research impact.

After that, we’ll briefly explore diffuse optical imaging, including techniques such as diffuse optical spectroscopy (DOS), diffuse optical tomography (DOT), fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT), and bioluminescence tomography (BLT). These are powerful research tools for small-animal and molecular imaging, though they are not yet commonly used in hospitals. Finally, we’ll touch on X-ray optical coupling, which includes X-ray luminescence computed tomography (XLCT) and X-ray micro-modulated luminescence tomography (XMLT) — exciting research directions that bridge X-ray and optical techniques.

Because this lecture stands alone without a textbook chapter, I’ve reorganized the material into a single, coherent story that combines what used to be two separate lectures. Follow along closely — treat this as a guided story rather than a set of isolated facts. At the end, you’ll find a homework question asking you to summarize key ideas like OCT, DOT, and BLT. Optionally, you can also transcribe parts of the lecture to help form a draft chapter. My goal is to make the lecture clear, logical, and enjoyable — so if you simply follow the story, you’ll understand the essential points.
