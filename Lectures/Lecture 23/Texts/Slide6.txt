Now, let’s look more closely at scattering in biological tissue.
Scattering happens because of all the small structures within cells and tissues. The exact way light scatters depends on the size, shape, and refractive index of those structures. We can actually classify scattering mechanisms based on the relative scale of the structures compared to the wavelength of light. When the structures are much smaller than the wavelength, we call that Rayleigh scattering. When they’re comparable in size to the wavelength, we call that Mie scattering.

I’m not going to dive into the mathematical formulas or the detailed physics behind these mechanisms — that would take us too far. But the key point is this: visible light directly interacts with cellular and molecular features. Every component inside a cell — the membrane, the nucleus, mitochondria, lysosomes, and so on — all participate in scattering. Depending on their size, each component affects light differently. So the light that comes out of tissue actually carries information about the microstructure inside.

This is why optical imaging is so biologically informative. It tells us about cells and molecules directly — something that X-rays or gamma rays can’t do. Optical imaging gives us the finest biological resolution among all imaging modalities we have today. The spatial scale of interaction is on the order of micrometers — that’s the cellular scale.

A typical cell is about 10 to 30 micrometers in diameter — that’s 10 to 30 millionths of a meter. Different cell types vary, of course, and within each cell, there’s a huge amount of structure. You have the nucleus, the nucleolus, the chromatin, the mitochondria, the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, many channels and vesicles — all these substructures scatter light differently. Each layer contributes to the complexity of how light behaves in tissue.

You know, cells are often called the “building blocks of life.” If you open any major journal like Science or Nature, you’ll see that phrase everywhere — and it’s true. Cells form the basic computational and functional units of biological systems. Later, when we talk about machine intelligence, you’ll see how we borrow this idea — we use “neurons” in artificial neural networks to mimic the way biological neurons process information.

So, to summarize, scattering happens at multiple levels — from whole cells to tiny organelles — and it gives us an incredible amount of information about biological organization. The optical properties vary with each structure, making tissue highly complex but also rich in information. And just as in X-ray imaging, we have concepts like transmission, absorption, fluorescence, and scattering. When all these are considered together, we call the combined attenuation — it’s very similar terminology. So you can see, optical imaging and X-ray imaging share parallel physics, but optical imaging operates at much smaller, biologically relevant scales.
