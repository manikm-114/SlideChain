Now, let’s look at one of the most common and important clinical uses of OCT — eye imaging. OCT is widely used for retinal examination. Here, you can see a cross-sectional OCT image of a normal human retina. The bright layers represent strong reflections — usually the interfaces between different tissue layers — while the darker regions show areas where light penetrates deeper before scattering. You can see here, the scale bar indicates about 250 micrometers — that’s just one-quarter of a millimeter — so this technique provides incredibly fine resolution.

Each layer of the retina — from the nerve fiber layer at the top to the photoreceptor layer at the bottom — has its own distinct optical properties. Because of this, the reflected interference pattern from each layer is slightly different. By analyzing these interference patterns, OCT can reveal the microstructure of the retina in exquisite detail.

What I’ve explained so far is the basic principle, but in practice, it’s a bit more sophisticated. You need laser scanning systems to move the beam precisely, and you use Fourier analysis to extract the depth information from the interference signals. By doing this repeatedly and precisely, you can reconstruct full three-dimensional images of the retina. OCT has become a standard tool in ophthalmology, helping doctors detect and monitor diseases like glaucoma, macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy.

So, from the same principle we learned earlier — optical interference — you can create a detailed, noninvasive image of the living eye. And not only that, this same technology can be adapted for other parts of the body. For example, you can even make a small optical biopsy probe or a catheter to use inside other organs.
