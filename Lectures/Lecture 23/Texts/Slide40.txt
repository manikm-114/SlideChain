Now, let’s talk about another idea — a really interesting one — that tries to make fluorescence tomography and bioluminescence tomography even better. The idea here is to combine optical imaging with X-ray imaging — a kind of hybrid approach.

You see, the limitation with traditional optical tomography is that it doesn’t give you good structural information. You can get molecular or functional data — yes, you can tell where the light comes from or which cells are active — but the anatomical detail is missing. On the other hand, X-ray CT gives you beautiful structure, very precise geometry, but not the molecular activity.
So, what if we could merge the two? What if we could combine the molecular sensitivity of optical imaging with the structural precision of X-ray imaging? That’s the motivation behind this work — we call it X-ray Optical Fusion.

Now, traditional micro-CT — the standard kind — has a limitation. It’s great for bone, great for dense structures, but not so good for soft tissue. The contrast inside soft organs is very weak because the attenuation difference is small. So, you can’t see the fine internal structures clearly.

That’s why researchers have started exploring X-ray Phase-Contrast CT, or PCCT. This is a newer type of X-ray imaging that doesn’t just rely on attenuation — it actually detects the phase shift of the X-rays as they pass through tissue. This phase information is much more sensitive to subtle density changes, especially in soft tissue.
So, the hybrid idea is: combine Fluorescence Molecular Tomography (FMT) with X-ray Phase-Contrast CT. Together, they can provide both the functional molecular information from FMT and the high-resolution anatomical detail from PCCT.

There’s a paper on this — you can see it here — titled “FMT–PCCT: Hybrid Fluorescence Molecular Tomography and X-ray Phase-Contrast CT Imaging of Mouse Models.” It was published in IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging in 2014 by researchers from the Helmholtz Center in Munich and collaborators in Germany. This kind of work really represents the next step — hybrid optical-X-ray imaging for small animal studies.
