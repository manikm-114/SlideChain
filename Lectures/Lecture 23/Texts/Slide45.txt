Now let’s look at this next example — this is an article introducing X-ray Luminescence Computed Tomography, or XLCT. This is a very creative and forward-looking concept.
The essential idea is shown right here. You introduce X-ray-excitable nanophosphors into a small animal — usually a mouse. These nanophosphors can be functionalized — meaning you can coat their surface with polymers or peptides to make them target specific biomarkers. For example, if you want to target cancer cells, you attach a peptide that binds to receptors that are overexpressed in tumors.

So now, when these nanophosphors are injected into the body, they accumulate more densely in the tumor region than in normal tissue. Then, when you shine an X-ray beam, it goes straight through the body. Wherever it hits these nanophosphors, they emit optical light. And that light — the X-ray-induced luminescence — is detected by sensitive optical cameras around the animal.

So think about it: by scanning the X-ray beam and recording the emitted light, you can reconstruct the 3D distribution of these nanophosphors inside the body. That gives you a molecular image that is excited by X-rays and detected optically.
This is a very promising approach because it potentially makes X-rays a molecular imaging modality — something traditionally reserved for optical, nuclear, or MR imaging. You can now use X-rays not just for structure, but also to identify specific molecular targets.

Of course, there are still challenges. When you collimate the X-ray beam — that means narrowing it to a small pencil beam — you face physical limits. Mechanical collimators can only get so thin, and even a narrow beam will spread out slightly due to scattering and beam divergence. So the current spatial resolution of XLCT is about 1 to 2 millimeters.
Now, the question becomes: how can we improve that? How can we go from millimeter resolution down to, say, 100 microns — an order of magnitude better? That’s still an open research problem. It will require new hardware designs, smarter reconstruction algorithms, and probably better nanophosphor materials.

But the vision is clear — this approach could bridge the gap between anatomical imaging and molecular imaging, between optical precision and X-ray penetration. It’s one of those rare ideas that brings together two worlds — physics and biology — into a single, unified imaging platform.
So that’s the direction of X-ray Luminescence CT and X-ray Optical Coupling — still developing, but with tremendous potential for the future of biomedical imaging.
