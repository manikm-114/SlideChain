At RPI, we’ve been taking this concept even further. We’re working on developing a tightly integrated system for in vivo optical and X-ray imaging — that means imaging live animals, not just tissue samples.

In the earlier work, what we call ex vivo imaging, the studies were done on isolated or preserved samples, which is great for testing physics, but not for observing biological dynamics. So, our goal is to move toward in vivo imaging, where we can study living processes in real time.
Our approach is to build an orthogonal imaging chain — basically, an X-ray phase-contrast system aligned at a right angle to an optical imaging system. One part of the setup handles the phase-contrast X-ray imaging, while the other captures fluorescence or bioluminescence signals. By merging these two datasets, we can combine the strengths of both modalities — structural accuracy from X-rays and molecular sensitivity from optics.

The system includes components like a CCD camera, filter wheel, laser stage, isoflurane anesthesia line for live animal support, and a rotating gantry for tomographic data collection. The optical part uses mirrors, spectrometers, and digital micromirror devices for detecting and filtering the light.
So, what we’re working toward at RPI is a fully integrated hybrid imaging system — one that can acquire X-ray phase-contrast data and optical molecular data simultaneously.

Now, this is still an active research topic. Achieving truly precise, stable 3D tomography in such a hybrid setup is not easy. There are still open questions — how to synchronize the modalities, how to register the datasets, how to compensate for motion, and how to achieve stable reconstructions.
But it’s an exciting direction. When you can successfully merge X-ray and optical data — one showing the anatomy, the other revealing the function — that’s when you get a truly powerful multimodal imaging system.

So, this is what we’re actively working on at RPI — a tighter, more integrated system that pushes the boundary of X-ray–optical fusion imaging. It’s challenging, but also very rewarding work.
