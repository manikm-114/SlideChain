From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nToday, we’re beginning a very unique chapter in this course, focusing on ultrasound imaging. This is exciting because ultrasound is rather cost-effective, and becomes increasingly more important due to hardware improvements and AI techniques. In this lecture, we’ll go through the fundamental principles behind ultrasound: what it is, how it works, and how it behaves in biological tissues.\n\nThen, in the next lecture, we’ll move on to ultrasound imaging modes — how the system collects, processes, and displays data. So, today is all about understanding the principles, the physics, and the key ideas that make ultrasound imaging possible.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
