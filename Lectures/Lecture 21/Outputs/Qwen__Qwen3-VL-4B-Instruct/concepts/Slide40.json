From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, let’s talk about image contrast in ultrasound imaging. The term “contrast” here simply refers to how different tissues appear relative to one another based on the strength of the returning echoes. In ultrasound, acoustic waves interact with different tissues in different ways — and that’s why we see some areas appearing brighter and others darker on the screen.\n\nWe use the prefixes “hyper” and “hypo” to describe this difference in the scattering amplitude of echoes. When a tissue produces echoes that have a higher scattering amplitude than the average, we call it “hyperechoic.” That means the reflected signal is stronger than normal, and it shows up as a bright region on the ultrasound image. Conversely, when the tissue has a lower scattering amplitude than average, we call it “hypoechoic.” In that case, the reflected signal is weaker, and it appears darker on the image.\n\nThese variations in brightness — from hyperechoic to hypoechoic — are what give us contrast. They allow us to distinguish one structure from another. For example, on the ultrasound image shown here, you can see how the liver, renal sinus fat, renal pyramids, and fluid-filled bowel loops all appear with different brightness levels. The renal sinus fat appears bright because it is hyperechoic — it reflects ultrasound strongly. The renal pyramids or fluid-filled bowel loops appear darker because they are hypoechoic — they scatter less energy.\n\nSome tissues, like the liver or renal cortex, tend to have uniform, mid-level echogenicity, meaning they reflect ultrasound in a moderate, consistent way. Others, like the anterior surface of the liver or the anterior surface of the kidney, are more reflective, showing distinct bright boundaries on the image.\n\nSo, in summary — the way ultrasound waves interact with various tissues determines the level of brightness on the image. Hyperechoic areas are brighter and correspond to stronger scatterers. Hypoechoic areas are darker and correspond to weaker scatterers. This difference in signal amplitude is the foundation of contrast in ultrasound imaging.\n\nHowever, sometimes the natural contrast between tissues is not sufficient to clearly separate structures or identify pathology. In such cases, we use contrast agents to improve visibility. One of the most effective types of contrast agents in ultrasound imaging is the microbubble. These microbubbles, typically ranging from two to five micrometers in diameter, are introduced into the bloodstream to enhance contrast. They act as additional reflective surfaces that increase backscattering, especially in regions where the natural contrast is weak.\n\nBy introducing microbubbles, we can significantly improve the visualization of internal structures, making it easier to detect lesions, tumors, or subtle tissue changes. This approach is particularly useful in clinical cases where precise imaging is needed to make accurate diagnoses.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
