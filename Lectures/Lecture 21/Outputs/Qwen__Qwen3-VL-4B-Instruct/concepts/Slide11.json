From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nOnce we start driving one side of the material — continuously pushing and pulling — the wave begins to propagate through the medium.\nEach small element of the tissue responds a little later than the one before it. So, if you look along the depth of the tissue, every point is moving up and down in the same pattern, but with a small phase delay.\n\nThat delay is what makes the wave travel forward. You still see the same waveform shape, but each point along the medium is slightly out of sync — slightly shifted in phase.\n\nThat’s what we call wave propagation — the motion is passed from one particle to the next, not instantaneously, but through a sequence of tiny, delayed reactions.\nIf the material were completely rigid, like a solid stick, every part would move together at once, and there would be no wave. But because biological tissue is elastic, parts of it move at slightly different times — and that’s exactly what allows the wave to form and travel.\n\nMathematically, if we focus on one physical quantity — say displacement w, or pressure p — and express all the other variables, like acceleration and velocity, in terms of that single variable, we can combine them into a single second-order differential equation.\n\nThat equation is called the wave equation, and it beautifully describes how the disturbance moves through the medium as a function of both space and time.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
