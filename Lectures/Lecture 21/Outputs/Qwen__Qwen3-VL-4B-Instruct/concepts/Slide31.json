From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo now let’s imagine what the damping effect really means — and more importantly, why we need it in ultrasound imaging.\n\nThink about how an ultrasound pulse is sent into the body. Most of the time, ultrasound imaging doesn’t use a continuous wave; instead, it operates in what we call a pulsed mode. You send out a pulse, it travels into the body, reflects from different tissue layers, and then comes back to the transducer as an echo. This pulsed approach is extremely useful because it allows us to measure both depth and velocity — that is, how deep a structure is and how fast it’s moving.\n\nNow, let’s say you apply a short electrical signal to the piezoelectric crystal — it vibrates for a moment and produces a burst of ultrasound waves. Then, you stop the input signal. Ideally, the crystal should also stop vibrating immediately, just like striking a bell and having it stop ringing right away. But in reality, if there’s no damping, the crystal keeps vibrating for quite a while after the excitation stops, almost like a bouncing ball that never settles down.\n\nIf there’s no damping — no internal friction — the ball keeps bouncing up and down forever. That’s exactly what would happen to your transducer: it would continue ringing, creating a long, drawn-out pulse. But we don’t want that, because a long pulse means poor resolution — the returning echoes overlap and you lose clarity.\nNow, if the transducer is placed in a medium with some friction — like air or fluid — those vibrations die out faster. The amplitude drops quickly, and you get a much shorter pulse. This reduction in vibration amplitude is called damping.\n\nSo, when we apply a damping material behind the crystal, it acts like friction for the vibrating transducer. It absorbs the leftover energy, preventing it from ringing too long. In the time domain, that means the vibration decays faster, giving us a short, clean pulse. In the frequency domain, the pulse now covers a wider range of frequencies — in other words, a broader bandwidth with a lower amplitude peak.\n\nWithout damping, you have a narrow and tall frequency spectrum — that’s a very sharp resonance around the central frequency. With damping, the spectrum is broader and flatter — the amplitude is smaller, but the bandwidth is much wider, which is exactly what we want for imaging.\nWe define this relationship using something called the Q factor, or the quality factor. Mathematically, Q equals two pi times the central frequency divided by the bandwidth. So, Q equals 2πf₀ divided by BW.\n\nA high-Q system means low damping — long vibration, narrow frequency range. A low-Q system means strong damping — short vibration, wide frequency range.\nFor diagnostic ultrasound, we actually prefer low-Q systems because we want short pulses and broad bandwidths. Typically, the Q factor is around 1 or 2, which provides an ideal balance between good axial resolution and manageable signal strength.\n\nSo, damping is what makes our ultrasound pulses short, our echoes sharp, and our images clear.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
