From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo when we solve the wave equation, we find that the constant c represents the speed of sound in the medium. And this speed depends entirely on the material properties — how dense and how stiff the material is. For example, sound waves travel very differently in air, in steel, or in biological tissue.\n\nIf we look at this table, we can see that the speed of sound in air is around 330 meters per second, in lung tissue about 600 meters per second, in fat about 1,450 meters per second, and in soft tissue around 1,540 meters per second. Water is very similar to soft tissue, around 1,480 meters per second, which is why we often use water-based gels in ultrasound coupling. In muscle, the speed is a bit higher, about 1,600 meters per second, and in bone, it reaches as high as 4,000 meters per second.\n\nSo, the denser and stiffer the material, the faster the sound travels through it. But within the same medium, like soft tissue, the speed stays constant — it’s a property of the material itself. What we can vary is the frequency of vibration. When we increase frequency, the wavelength becomes shorter. So, higher frequency means shorter wavelength, and lower frequency means longer wavelength.\n\nThis relationship between frequency and wavelength is fundamental in ultrasound physics — it helps determine both resolution and penetration in imaging.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
