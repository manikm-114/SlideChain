From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nOkay, now we'll talk about acoustic impedance. This concept is actually not dramatically different from what we’ve already learned in electrical circuits. Remember when we studied circuit analysis? We defined resistance as the ratio between voltage and current. Later, we introduced impedance, which included the effects of capacitance and inductance, and again it was defined as voltage over current. The only difference was that, in general, impedance can have a phase shift, so it’s expressed as a complex number — meaning that both voltage and current can be complex, or we can simply describe them in terms of their phase relationship.\n\nNow, think about this analogy in the context of ultrasound. In an electrical circuit, voltage is the driving force — the potential difference that pushes electrons through the conductor. In ultrasound, the driving force is pressure, P. The mechanical wave you push into the medium — that’s the pressure wave. So, just as voltage drives electron motion, pressure drives the particle motion in the tissue.\n\nIn an electrical circuit, current is the flow of electrons. But in ultrasound, no electrons are flowing; instead, the medium’s molecules — air molecules or soft tissue molecules — move back and forth along one direction. At any given location, they have an instantaneous velocity, which we call u z. So, at each point in space, the particles have an instantaneous velocity that’s changing with time.\n\nBoth P and u keep changing with time, but when we solve the wave equation, we find something very interesting. It’s beyond the scope of this lecture to show the full derivation, but the result is that the ratio between pressure and velocity — P over u — is constant at any given location. Even though both pressure and velocity oscillate as the wave propagates, their ratio remains constant in amplitude. Because this ratio stays constant, we can define it as a characteristic property of the medium.\n\nThis constant ratio is what we call acoustic impedance, denoted by Z. If the ratio kept changing, it would depend on position or time, and we couldn’t define it as an intrinsic property of the material. But because it’s stable and characteristic, it gives us something meaningful — a property that tells us how the medium resists the passage of sound.\n\nAcoustic impedance is extremely important in ultrasound imaging. When we use an ultrasound transducer, we have to make sure that the acoustic impedance of the transducer matches the acoustic impedance of the tissue we’re imaging — for example, the abdomen. If there’s a big mismatch between them, the energy cannot enter the body effectively, and you can’t collect the echo signals efficiently. That’s why we use ultrasound gel — it acts as a coupling layer that bridges the impedance gap between the probe and the skin.\n\nSo, to define it heuristically: acoustic impedance is like voltage over current in an electrical system. Here it’s pressure over particle velocity. We can show this mathematically, though I won’t go through the full derivation now. By solving the mechanical wave equation, we can prove that Z is constant and depends only on the material’s intrinsic properties — specifically, density (rho) and sound speed (c).\n\nMathematically, we can write this as Z equals rho times c. And we know that the sound speed, c, can be expressed as one over the square root of rho times kappa, where kappa is the compressibility. So, substituting that into the equation, we get Z equals rho over the square root of rho times kappa, which simplifies to Z equals the square root of rho over kappa.\n\nThis shows that acoustic impedance depends on both density and compressibility, and it is a fundamental property of the material.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
