Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo next, let’s talk about ultrasound–tissue interaction. Earlier, we mentioned how different imaging modalities interact with biological tissues. For example, X-ray and CT involve attenuation and scattering, while gamma-ray imaging behaves similarly. In MRI, we talk about T1 and T2 relaxation parameters to describe energy interactions within tissues.\n\nFor ultrasound, the same basic idea applies — it’s all about energy propagation and how that energy interacts with biological structures. The first major effect we talk about is reflection. When a sound wave hits a boundary where there is a difference in acoustic impedance — for example, between air and tissue, or between bone and tissue — some of the energy is reflected. That’s what creates the echoes we use to form ultrasound images.\nReflection happens because of impedance mismatch. If the impedance difference is large, reflection is strong. If the impedances are well matched, reflection is weak, and more energy passes through.\n\nNow, with X-rays and gamma rays, reflection is not really an issue, because their wavelengths are extremely short and the photons are so energetic that they mostly pass straight through. In ultrasound, however, the wavelength is much larger, so reflection becomes significant.\nSo, remember this simple rule: reflection at a boundary means a change in direction.\n\nThe second effect is scattering. When ultrasound waves travel through tissue, they encounter many small structures — cells, organelles, connective fibers — that scatter energy in different directions. So, instead of traveling as a narrow beam, the energy spreads out or diffuses. You can think of this like Compton scattering in X-rays — energy is diffused, and the propagation direction changes randomly.\n\nThe third effect is absorption, which converts mechanical energy into heat. In the case of X-rays, this corresponds to the photoelectric effect, where photon energy is absorbed completely. For ultrasound, as the wave passes through tissue, the molecules oscillate back and forth, and because of internal friction, some of the mechanical energy is lost as heat.\n\nThis leads to attenuation, which is the overall reduction in intensity. Attenuation happens because energy is both absorbed and scattered away. The wave’s amplitude becomes smaller, its pressure decreases, and the particle displacements become weaker as it moves deeper.\n\nIf we look at Figure 3.3, it illustrates how the beam behaves when it meets a boundary between two materials with impedances Z1 and Z2. If the wave hits perpendicularly, part of it is reflected back and part is transmitted forward. In more general cases, where the wave hits the surface at an angle, we define the incident angle (theta i), the reflected angle (theta r), and the transmitted angle (theta t). The incident angle equals the reflected angle, but the transmission angle can differ depending on the material properties.\n\nThe energy divides between reflection and transmission, and the total energy always equals the incident energy. The ratios of reflected to transmitted energy can be expressed in terms of pressure amplitude, and when you square those amplitudes, you get the intensity ratios.\n\nThese ratios depend on the acoustic impedance values of the two materials, Z1 and Z2, as well as the angles of incidence and transmission.\nIf Z1 equals Z2 — meaning the materials are identical — there will be no reflection at all, and all the energy will pass straight through. But if the impedances are very different — for example, if one of them is close to zero — then the reflection coefficient becomes one, meaning all the energy is reflected back.\n\nThat’s why impedance matching is so important in ultrasound imaging — it ensures that most of the sound energy enters the body instead of being reflected away at the surface.\n\nSo, in summary, ultrasound–tissue interaction involves five main effects: reflection, refraction, scattering, absorption, and attenuation. Together, these determine how the ultrasound wave propagates, how it loses energy, and how we detect it for image formation.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
