From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nOkay, now let’s talk about medical imaging again, focusing on the five major modalities we’ve been studying.\u000bWe’ve already gone through X-ray imaging, nuclear imaging, and MRI — the three big ones. The next one is ultrasound, and after that, we’ll finish with optical imaging, which, as you’ll see later, is also very unique and quite powerful.\n\nUltrasound imaging has several clear advantages. First, it involves no ionizing radiation. That’s very important because, unlike X-rays or gamma rays, ultrasound uses mechanical sound waves, not electromagnetic radiation. So there’s no risk of DNA damage and no concern about radiation-induced cancer.\nAnother major strength is speed. Ultrasound provides images in real time — you can literally move the probe and watch the image update instantly. The transducer, or ultrasound probe, can be gently moved across the body, for example, over the abdomen to monitor a baby during pregnancy, or over the chest to examine cardiac function. It’s a quick, flexible, and low-cost imaging modality.\n\nOf course, like every imaging method, ultrasound has its limitations. One limitation is the penetration depth. It can’t go very deep into the body, especially through hard tissue or bone. X-ray imaging, in contrast, is excellent for bone-tissue or tissue-air interfaces — like lungs or bones — because those materials have very different densities and attenuate X-rays differently. Ultrasound, on the other hand, depends on acoustic impedance, which determines how sound travels through a material. When there’s a large mismatch in impedance, such as between air and bone, most of the ultrasound energy reflects back instead of penetrating.\n\nThat’s why it’s difficult to image structures behind the lungs or skull. To get a clear image of the heart, for example, you have to find an acoustic window between the ribs — an area where sound can travel through soft tissue effectively.\n\nUltrasound imaging mainly works on the principle of reflection and scattering. The system sends out sound waves; those waves hit structures inside the body — tissue boundaries, organs, or small particles — and the echoes are detected to form an image. There are also transmission-based ultrasound methods, but those are less common in clinical imaging.\n\nBeyond diagnosis, ultrasound is used for image-guided procedures, such as biopsies and minimally invasive surgeries, where live ultrasound images can be registered with prior CT or MRI scans to help guide the doctor precisely.\n\nAnd in recent years, ultrasound has even found a role in neuromodulation — using focused ultrasound to stimulate neural tissue, potentially helping to treat conditions like depression or Parkinson’s disease. This is a very exciting and emerging field, showing that ultrasound is far more than just an imaging tool.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
