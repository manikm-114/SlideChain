From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nToday, we’re beginning a very unique chapter in this course, focusing on ultrasound imaging. This is exciting because ultrasound is rather cost-effective, and becomes increasingly more important due to hardware improvements and AI techniques. In this lecture, we’ll go through the fundamental principles behind ultrasound: what it is, how it works, and how it behaves in biological tissues.\n\nThen, in the next lecture, we’ll move on to ultrasound imaging modes — how the system collects, processes, and displays data. So, today is all about understanding the principles, the physics, and the key ideas that make ultrasound imaging possible.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"ultrasound imaging\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"cost-effective\", \"category\": \"software\"},\n    {\"term\": \"hardware improvements\", \"category\": \"instrumentation\"},\n    {\"term\": \"AI techniques\", \"category\": \"ai_ml\"},\n    {\"term\": \"fundamental principles\", \"category\": \"physics\"},\n    {\"term\": \"biological tissues\", \"category\": \"anatomy\"},\n    {\"term\": \"collects, processes, and displays data\", \"category\": \"data_processing\"},\n    {\"term\": \"principles, physics, and key ideas\", \"category\": \"signal_processing\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"This is exciting because ultrasound is rather cost-effective, and becomes increasingly more important due to hardware improvements and AI techniques.\", \"In this lecture, we’ll go through the fundamental principles behind ultrasound: what it is, how it works, and how it behaves in biological tissues.\"]\n}\n```",
