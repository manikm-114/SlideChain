From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, let’s talk about the trade-off between resolution and penetration in ultrasound imaging. This is a very important concept that determines how clearly you can see structures at different depths inside the body.\n\nIf you want to get higher resolution, generally you need to increase the frequency of your ultrasound wave. Higher frequency means a shorter wavelength, and that allows you to distinguish smaller structures — that’s why high-frequency ultrasound is used for imaging shallow organs like the thyroid or the eye.\n\nHowever, there’s a price you pay for this. Higher frequency sound waves are attenuated much faster as they travel through tissue. Remember that the attenuation coefficient, alpha, is proportional to frequency — we can say alpha is proportional to f. So, as frequency increases, attenuation also increases. That means the ultrasound wave loses energy faster, and it can’t penetrate as deeply into the body.\n\nIn contrast, a lower frequency transducer can send energy much deeper, but it comes with lower resolution. For example, a 12 megahertz transducer provides excellent resolution but can’t reach very deep — maybe just a few centimeters. On the other hand, a 3 megahertz transducer can reach much deeper into the abdomen, but the image will be coarser.\n\nSo, in practice, we always balance these two factors. You choose your transducer frequency based on the target you want to image — high frequency for fine detail near the surface, and low frequency for deeper penetration. This is one of the most fundamental trade-offs in ultrasound imaging.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
