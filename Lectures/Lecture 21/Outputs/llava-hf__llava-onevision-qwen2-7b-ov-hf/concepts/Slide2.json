From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere’s our course schedule to remind you where we are. After these two lectures on ultrasound, we’ll finish the green book, which means we’ll have covered everything from X-ray, CT, MRI, PET, to ultrasound imaging.\n\nAfter that, we’ll move beyond the textbook to discuss optical imaging. This topic is not included in the green book, but they’re very important to know. Optical imaging is fascinating, and like US imaging it becomes increasingly relevant with advancement of AI methods in this area.\n\nFor now, your main focus should be on the ultrasound chapter in the green book. It’s about twenty pages long, so it’s quite manageable. I recommend reading it carefully — it’s actually quite an enjoyable read, almost like a story.\n\nSo today, let me walk you through the first part of that chapter — the foundation that connects the physics of sound with medical imaging.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Each concept must appear verbatim (case-insensitive) in SLIDE_TEXT.\n- Assign exactly one category from:\n  software | workflow | mathematics | signal_processing | frequency_domain |\n  physics | instrumentation | data_processing | reconstruction |\n  quality_metric | communication | modality | anatomy | algorithm | ai_ml\n- Category guidance:\n  * software → programming tools/environments (MATLAB, Octave, MathWorks)\n  * workflow → procedural/course steps (BUT exclude admin like office hours)\n  * mathematics / signal_processing / frequency_domain → formulas, transforms, filters, spectra\n  * physics → energy, radiation, waves, gradients, attenuation\n  * instrumentation → scanners, detectors, coils, transducers, gantry\n  * data_processing / reconstruction → corrections, backprojection, iterative, FBP, FFT usage\n  * quality_metric → SNR, resolution, artifacts, MTF, DQE\n  * communication → network or data transfer\n  * modality → CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, Ultrasound (US), Optical/Photoacoustic, etc.\n  * anatomy → biological structures (organs, tissues, bones, vessels) ONLY\n  * algorithm → analytical/iterative computational methods\n  * ai_ml → learning methods (deep learning, CNN, transformer, self-supervised)\n- Reject filler or administrative text (office hours, emails, rooms, homework logistics).\n- Output format:\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"<exact term from slide>\", \"category\": \"<category>\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"<short supporting phrase from SLIDE_TEXT>\"]\n}\nassistant\n```json\n{\n  \"concepts\": [\n    {\"term\": \"ultrasound\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"medical imaging\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"X-ray\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"CT\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"MRI\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"PET\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"AI methods\", \"category\": \"ai_ml\"},\n    {\"term\": \"optical imaging\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"US imaging\", \"category\": \"modality\"},\n    {\"term\": \"AI\", \"category\": \"ai_ml\"},\n    {\"term\": \"SNR\", \"category\": \"quality_metric\"},\n    {\"term\": \"resolution\", \"category\": \"quality_metric\"},\n    {\"term\": \"artifacts\", \"category\": \"quality_metric\"},\n    {\"term\": \"MTF\", \"category\": \"quality_metric\"},\n    {\"term\": \"DQE\", \"category\": \"quality_metric\"}\n  ],\n  \"evidence\": [\"After these two lectures on ultrasound, we’ll finish the green book, which means we",
