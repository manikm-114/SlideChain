From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s take a closer look at how these relationships actually work.\u000bWhen we push on one side of the medium — for example, this piston here — we create a velocity, which we call u. The displacement, denoted as w, shows how far the boundary moves. In a simple case, displacement is proportional to velocity times time. Mathematically, we write this as w equals u times t.\nThat’s a linear relationship, meaning if you double the velocity, the displacement doubles in the same time period.\n\nBut, on the other side of the same element, the motion doesn’t happen immediately. The molecules there need time to respond, and that brings in acceleration, which we represent as a. The displacement caused by acceleration is a second-order relationship, expressed as w equals one-half times a times t squared.\nSo the first one — w equals u times t — is linear, and the second one — w equals one-half a t squared — is quadratic in time.\n\nThis means when you push on one side of a small tissue element, that side moves first, while the far side lags behind slightly. Because of this delay, the material between them becomes compressed, and pressure increases.\n\nThis process isn’t perfectly synchronized — one side moves first, then the other side catches up. That’s why we get a pressure increment. The delay in motion creates compression, and that’s how the ultrasound wave starts to form.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the combination of displacement, velocity, and acceleration, together with changes in pressure and volume, gives us the basic mechanism of wave formation in tissue.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
