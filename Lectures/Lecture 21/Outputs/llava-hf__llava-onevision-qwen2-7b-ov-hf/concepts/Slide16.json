From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, it’s nice for you to know this — as we look deeper into how a sound wave propagates, we can see that when the wave travels into a field, energy is actually being carried through the medium. Earlier, we talked about the wave equation in terms of displacement, and if you take the first derivative of displacement with respect to time, you get velocity. That’s what’s shown here in this equation: u  z equals dW over dT.\n\nA typical value for u z, the particle velocity, is around one to ten centimeters per second, which is much smaller than the speed of sound, c. So that’s something to remember — the medium’s particles move slowly, even though the sound wave itself travels fast.\n\nNow, because the sound wave is propagating, it also introduces pressure into the field. That pressure at a given point can be computed as shown here: p equals rho times c times u z. It’s a very straightforward relationship — the pressure is proportional to the density of the medium, the sound speed, and the particle velocity.\nSince the wave equation can be solved, and as I explained before, both the pressure and the velocity take on sinusoidal waveforms, we can represent each of them using an oscillating form — exponential or sinusoidal — like this: p of t equals p naught e to the j omega t, and u z of t equals u naught e to the j omega t. So now, you have both quantities — pressure and velocity — in a sinusoidal oscillation form.\n\nFrom here, we can define intensity, represented by I. The average intensity over a period, capital T, is defined as the product of p and u, averaged over time. Now, let’s think about this physically. Pressure, p, has the unit of force per unit area, so you can think of it as force distributed across a surface.\n\nIf you apply a force to move something over a certain distance, that’s work. So, this is essentially the work you did. But notice that in this case, we’re not talking about displacement or distance directly — u is the rate of change of displacement, or in other words, velocity. That means we’re really talking about the rate at which work is done — and the rate of doing work is power.\n\nSo, if you multiply pressure (which is force per area) by velocity (which is displacement over time), what you get is power per unit area, and that’s exactly what intensity represents. It’s how much power, or energy per unit time, is transmitted through a certain area in the medium.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\u000bPressure, p, corresponds to force per area.\u000bVelocity, u, is displacement per time.\u000bMultiply them together — p times u — and you get work per time per area, or power density, which we call intensity.\nThat’s how these three physical quantities — velocity, pressure, and intensity — are all linked. And even though these can be derived from the wave equation, here we’re just focusing on their basic definitions and physical meanings.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
