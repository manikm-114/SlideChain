From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAlright, as I mentioned before, the intensity of the acoustic wave — and likewise the pressure amplitude — decreases as you go deeper and deeper into the medium. And the reason both intensity and pressure amplitude become smaller and smaller is due to attenuation.\n\nNow, why do we have attenuation? Because we have two main effects: absorption and scattering. Some of the energy is absorbed and turned into heat, while some is scattered — redirected into other directions. Along the main beam direction, the intensity keeps getting smaller, and the pressure amplitude also decreases.\nThis is not a strange concept to us — we’ve seen exponential decay many times before. In nuclear imaging in X-ray imaging, exponential decay appears everywhere. It’s a very common phenomenon. And every time we see exponential decay, we can use it to understand how strongly our target interacts with the probing beam. Based on the attenuation rate, we can tell how dense or how light certain tissues are.\nThat’s really the imaging mechanism — attenuation gives us contrast.\n\nNow, the same logic applies here as with X-rays. You don’t want something that absorbs energy too quickly. If all the X-rays — or all the ultrasound — are absorbed by the body, then the detector sees nothing. Every photon, or every bit of energy, gets eaten up, and no information is carried out.\nBut on the other hand, you also don’t want the ultrasound beam to pass through the body without any attenuation. If everything goes through unchanged, again, you get no information.\n\nThe ideal situation is somewhere in between — you want about half the energy absorbed, and half transmitted. Not exactly fifty–fifty in every case, but roughly half. That balance gives you the maximum contrast and allows you to reconstruct a meaningful tomographic image.\n\nNow, I often make this analogy with exams. When I give you an examination, I try to set it up so that the class average is around fifty percent. Why? Because that gives me the best spread — I can see which questions are tricky and which ones you can solve easily. It allows me to judge relative performance much more clearly. So, don’t worry if your average score isn’t high. I purposely don’t aim for a high average, because it gives me better information about the class as a whole. And in the end, your final letter grades — A, B, or C — are assigned consistently with the overall performance distribution. So nobody is unfairly graded.\n\nComing back to imaging, the same principle applies. The attenuation curve gives us the contrast we need — not too much, not too little. And in ultrasound, we often use two equivalent forms to describe it: μ, the attenuation coefficient for intensity, and α, the attenuation coefficient for pressure. These are just two different ways to express the same exponential decay behavior. On a decibel scale, μ and α become interchangeable.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
