Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s talk about some practical implications of reflection coefficients — this is really an extension of what I already mentioned earlier.\nYou cannot penetrate ribs or air bubbles easily, because their acoustic impedances are very different from those of soft tissue. When there’s a large mismatch in impedance, most of the ultrasound energy is reflected, and very little gets through.\n\nAlso, if you try to do brain imaging in vivo, the skull will reflect almost all of the ultrasound. That’s why we don’t use ultrasound to image the brain the same way we use CT or MRI. The bone–tissue boundary is such a strong reflector that almost no energy gets inside.\nEven inside the brain, gray matter and white matter are acoustically very uniform. In a uniform medium, the ultrasound wave passes straight through without much change — kind of like a transparent window. But that also means you don’t get contrast. It’s like when everyone in the class scores a perfect 100 — I can’t tell who is better, because everyone looks the same.\n\nOn the other extreme, if you have a strong mismatch — for example, at a tissue–bone interface — the ultrasound wave cannot penetrate at all. Everything is reflected. That’s like an exam where everyone scores zero — again, I can’t tell who’s better.\nSo, what we really need is a good balance — a useful imaging window. In practice, this means finding acoustic windows that allow sound to enter effectively. For instance, when imaging the heart, we position the probe around the ribs to find a small gap where the sound can pass through. We also make sure to use ultrasound gel between the transducer and the skin, because that gel helps match the impedance between the probe and the tissue. Without it, the air gap would cause almost total reflection, and no signal would enter the body.\n\nSo the key idea is this: reflection depends on impedance mismatch. If there’s too little mismatch, there’s no contrast — everything looks uniform. But if the mismatch is too large, nothing penetrates — you can’t see anything. The useful imaging window lies in between.\nThis is something I’ve mentioned before, and you can read through the bullet points on the slide to reinforce the idea. The goal is always the same: find the right balance between reflection and transmission to get good imaging quality.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
