Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAlright, now we’ve arrived at one of the most elegant equations in all of physics — the wave equation. In one dimension, it looks like this: partial squared W over partial Z squared equals one over C squared times partial squared W over partial T squared. So what does that mean? It means that the second derivative of displacement, W, with respect to space, Z, is equal to one over C squared times the second derivative of W with respect to time, T. In plain words, the way the wave changes in space is directly linked to how it changes in time. Space and time are tied together through this relationship. You can even think of it conceptually as “space equals time” — not literally, but in a second-derivative sense. This symmetry is what gives rise to those beautiful, smooth, repeating sinusoidal waves we see in sound or vibration.\n\nNow, let’s talk about the speed of sound, denoted by C. C depends on two key material properties — density, which we call rho, and compressibility, which we call kappa. The relationship is given by this equation: C equals one divided by the square root of kappa times rho. Here, rho — written as the Greek letter ρ — represents the density of the tissue, and kappa — the Greek letter κ — represents compressibility, which is actually the inverse of the bulk modulus, or in other words, how stiff the material is.\n\nNow here’s the interesting part. The stiffer the tissue, the smaller the compressibility. And when compressibility is small, the wave travels faster. So, in biological tissues, sound typically moves at about fifteen hundred meters per second — that’s roughly the speed in soft tissue or water. But in bone, which is much stiffer, the speed can reach around four thousand meters per second. And clinically, this becomes quite important. For example, a malignant tumor tends to be harder than normal tissue. That means sound travels faster through it. So in ultrasound elastography, we can actually measure that difference in speed to assess tissue stiffness — and that helps identify abnormalities like tumors.\n\nSo this simple equation — the wave equation — doesn’t just tell us how sound moves; it also connects directly to the mechanical properties of the body — its density, its stiffness, and its elasticity. That’s the physical foundation of how ultrasound works.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
