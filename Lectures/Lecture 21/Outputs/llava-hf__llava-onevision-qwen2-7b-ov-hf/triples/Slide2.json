  "raw_output": "user \nSystem:\nYou are extracting factual relations from a medical imaging lecture. Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nHere’s our course schedule to remind you where we are. After these two lectures on ultrasound, we’ll finish the green book, which means we’ll have covered everything from X-ray, CT, MRI, PET, to ultrasound imaging.\n\nAfter that, we’ll move beyond the textbook to discuss optical imaging. This topic is not included in the green book, but they’re very important to know. Optical imaging is fascinating, and like US imaging it becomes increasingly relevant with advancement of AI methods in this area.\n\nFor now, your main focus should be on the ultrasound chapter in the green book. It’s about twenty pages long, so it’s quite manageable. I recommend reading it carefully — it’s actually quite an enjoyable read, almost like a story.\n\nSo today, let me walk you through the first part of that chapter — the foundation that connects the physics of sound with medical imaging.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if the relation is clearly visible without the text.\n- confidence in [0,1]. Do not invent entities or relations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"ultrasound imaging\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"medical imaging\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"After these two lectures on ultrasound, we’ll finish the green book, which means we’ll have covered everything from X-ray, CT, MRI, PET, to ultrasound imaging.\"}\n  ]\n}",
