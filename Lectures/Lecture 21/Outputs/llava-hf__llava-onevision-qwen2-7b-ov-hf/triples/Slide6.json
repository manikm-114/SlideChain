Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s look at this picture, which illustrates a classic experiment that helps us understand what sound really is. This is Robert Boyle’s experiment, one of the earliest demonstrations of how sound needs a medium to travel.\n\nSo imagine this setup: we have a ringing alarm clock placed inside a large glass chamber with a valve on top. At first, the clock is ringing, and you can clearly hear the sound through the air inside the container. Then, we connect a vacuum pump and start to remove the air from the chamber.\n\nAs the air is pumped out, the sound of the clock becomes weaker and weaker until eventually, you can hardly hear anything at all. The clock is still ringing, but with almost no air inside the chamber, there’s nothing to carry the sound waves to your ears.\nThen, when you open the valve and let air rush back into the chamber, the sound suddenly becomes loud again.\n\nThis simple experiment beautifully demonstrates that sound waves require a medium — such as air, water, or tissue — to propagate. Unlike light or X-rays, which can travel through a vacuum, mechanical waves cannot.\n\nSo, in ultrasound imaging, the same principle applies: the sound waves travel through biological tissue, reflecting and scattering as they go, allowing us to measure and form images. Without a proper medium — say, if there’s air between the transducer and the skin — no ultrasound signal would be transmitted effectively. That’s why, as you’ll see later, we always use ultrasound gel to eliminate air gaps and ensure good acoustic coupling between the probe and the body.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
