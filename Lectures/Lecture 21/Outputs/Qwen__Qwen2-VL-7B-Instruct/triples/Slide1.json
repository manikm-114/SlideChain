Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nToday, we’re beginning a very unique chapter in this course, focusing on ultrasound imaging. This is exciting because ultrasound is rather cost-effective, and becomes increasingly more important due to hardware improvements and AI techniques. In this lecture, we’ll go through the fundamental principles behind ultrasound: what it is, how it works, and how it behaves in biological tissues.\n\nThen, in the next lecture, we’ll move on to ultrasound imaging modes — how the system collects, processes, and displays data. So, today is all about understanding the principles, the physics, and the key ideas that make ultrasound imaging possible.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.\n- Output a triple only if both subject and object appear verbatim in SLIDE_TEXT (case-insensitive).\n- Predicates must be one of: uses | via | represents | depends_on | measures | produces | reconstructs_with.\n- Add modalities [\"text\"] by default; add \"image\" only if clearly visible without the text.\n- Confidence in [0,1].\n\nOUTPUT:\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"<verbatim subject>\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"<verbatim object>\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"<short quote from SLIDE_TEXT>\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nassistant\n{\n  \"triples\": [\n    {\"s\":\"ultrasound imaging\", \"p\":\"uses|via|represents|depends_on|measures|produces|reconstructs_with\",\n     \"o\":\"ultrasound\", \"modalities\":[\"text\",\"image\"], \"confidence\":0.0, \"evidence\":\"ultrasound is increasingly more important due to hardware improvements and AI techniques.\"}\n  ]\n}",
