Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo now, let’s do a quick review and apply what we just learned. We’ll look at how to calculate remaining intensity and half-value thickness for ultrasound.\nFor the first example, we start with a 100 milliwatt ultrasound pulse that loses 30 decibels as it travels through tissue. Using the formula, negative 30 dB equals 10 log of I2 over 100 milliwatts, we can solve for I2. Rearranging, we get I2 equals 10 to the power of negative three times 100 milliwatts, which equals 0.1 milliwatt. So, after losing 30 dB, the intensity is reduced by a factor of one thousand.\n\nNow, let’s look at the second example — the half-value thickness. This represents the depth at which the ultrasound intensity drops by 50 percent. That means I2 over I1 equals 0.5. Using the decibel formula again, we get 10 log of 0.5 equals negative 3 dB. So, when the intensity is reduced by half, it corresponds to a 3 decibel change.\n\nThis concept is very similar to what we use in X-ray or gamma-ray imaging, where we also talk about a “half-value layer.” It tells us how deep the wave can travel before its intensity is halved.\n\nIn ultrasound, this is just a convenient way to express relative changes using logarithms — there’s no physical constant behind it; it’s simply a mathematical convenience. The decibel scale helps us describe very large or very small intensity ratios in a practical and readable way.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
