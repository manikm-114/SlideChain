Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, let’s talk about how attenuation depends on frequency.\nHere, the coefficient α is proportional to a constant, which we call α-naught, and it’s also proportional to frequency. Mathematically, we often write this as alpha of f equals alpha-naught times f to the power of b.\n\nFor diagnostic ultrasound, the value of b is about one, which means the relationship is almost linear. In other words, as the frequency increases, attenuation increases linearly.\nSo, higher frequency means stronger attenuation. And that makes perfect sense physically. Think about it: when you vibrate molecules more frequently, they move back and forth faster. Faster motion means more friction inside the tissue, and that friction converts energy into heat. So, higher frequency means you lose energy faster — the wave decays in intensity and amplitude more quickly.\nIn simple terms: higher frequency equals higher energy loss equals less penetration.\n\nNow, for different types of materials, the constant α-naught is different. If you look at the table on the slide, you’ll see that fat has a smaller α-naught value, while liver is a little higher. Cardiac muscle is higher still, and bone has a very large value — meaning sound doesn’t penetrate bone very well.\n\nYou can use these numbers to get a sense of how attenuation works in different tissues. For example, let’s take fat at 5 megahertz. You can calculate attenuation as five megahertz times zero point six three decibels per centimeter per megahertz, which equals about three point one five decibels per centimeter. After traveling four centimeters, that’s twelve point six decibels of attenuation. The relative amplitude of the wave becomes ten to the power of negative twelve point six divided by twenty, which is about zero point two three four.\n\nSo, as frequency increases, attenuation increases. That’s why in medical ultrasound we always have to make a trade-off: high frequency gives you better resolution but less depth, while low frequency penetrates deeper but gives you lower resolution.\nThe takeaway is simple and important: higher frequency → larger attenuation coefficient → less penetration depth.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
