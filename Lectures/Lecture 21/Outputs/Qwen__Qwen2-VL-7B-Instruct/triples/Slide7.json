Use only information grounded in the input SLIDE_TEXT.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, let’s take a closer look at what an ultrasound wave actually is.\u000bHere, the medium — whether air, water, or biological tissue — is made up of countless tiny molecules. When a transducer or some vibrating source starts pushing on those molecules, it moves them back and forth along one direction — say, the z-axis.\n\nWhen the transducer pushes the molecules forward, they become compressed, and when it pulls back, they spread apart. This alternating process of compression and rarefaction creates a longitudinal wave that travels through the medium.\nIf you look carefully at the top figure, the denser areas represent compressions, where molecules are packed tightly together and pressure is high. The lighter areas show rarefactions, where the molecules are spread apart and the pressure is lower.\n\nNow, something very interesting happens here: the wave itself travels forward, but the individual molecules don’t actually move along with it. Each molecule simply vibrates back and forth around its equilibrium position — it oscillates, but it doesn’t go anywhere overall.\n\nSo, the sound wave is really a transfer of energy through the medium, not a transfer of matter. The wave moves, but the particles stay roughly where they are, just vibrating locally. That’s an essential idea to keep in mind when we talk about how ultrasound propagates through tissue — the energy travels forward, not the molecules themselves.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return JSON only.
