From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow, let’s take a look at the single-crystal transducer, which is one of the simplest yet most important components in ultrasound systems.\nIf you look at the diagram from your textbook, you can see all the key parts clearly labeled. At the heart of the transducer is the piezoelectric crystal, the active element that generates and receives ultrasound waves. On one side, there is a matching layer, which I mentioned earlier — it’s used to match the acoustic impedance of the crystal to that of the tissue. Without this layer, much of the energy would be reflected at the interface, and very little sound would enter the body.\n\nBehind the crystal, you’ll see a damping material. This is essential because it absorbs unwanted echoes and stops the crystal from ringing after each pulse. The damping material ensures that the emitted pulse is short and well-defined, giving us better axial resolution in the image.\n\nSurrounding everything, there’s an acoustic insulator or backing, which directs the ultrasound wave forward into the tissue rather than allowing it to leak backward into the housing. There’s also a conducting wire, or contact lead, which connects to the electrical circuitry, allowing us to apply voltage across the crystal and receive electrical signals from it.\nAll of these components — the crystal, the matching layer, the damping material, and the insulator — are enclosed in a metal or plastic housing, often with an ergonomic handle. Together they form what we call a single-element transducer.\nMathematically, this crystal has a natural resonant frequency, denoted as f-zero, given by the formula f-zero equals the speed of sound in the crystal divided by twice its thickness.\u000bIn other words,\u000bF-Zero equals c-crystal over 2 d.\n\nSo, the frequency of the ultrasound wave is determined by how fast sound travels in the crystal and how thick the crystal is. A thinner crystal produces higher frequency sound, while a thicker one produces lower frequency sound.\n\nThis simple relationship between frequency, sound speed, and crystal thickness is fundamental to designing ultrasound probes for different applications. High-frequency probes, which give better resolution, use very thin crystals, while low-frequency probes, which penetrate deeper, use thicker ones.\nSo, this diagram gives you the complete picture — from physical design to mathematical principle — of a single-crystal transducer.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
