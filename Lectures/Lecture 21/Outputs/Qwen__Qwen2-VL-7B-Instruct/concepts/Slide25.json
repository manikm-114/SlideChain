From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nAlright, now let’s talk about something quite interesting — the biological effects of ultrasound. When we introduce ultrasound energy into the body, it can lead to two kinds of effects: thermal effects and non-thermal effects.\n\nI’ve already mentioned the thermal effects earlier, but let’s quickly recall them. When ultrasound travels through tissue, part of its mechanical energy gets converted into heat. This heating can cause several physiological changes — for instance, it can increase collagen tissue extensibility, which makes soft tissues more flexible. It can also increase blood flow, which improves circulation and oxygen delivery. In addition, it can increase nerve conduction velocity, meaning that nerve impulses travel faster. This effect can also raise the pain threshold, allowing patients to tolerate more discomfort during therapy.\nMoreover, heating can enhance enzymatic activity — many enzymes in the body function more efficiently at slightly elevated temperatures. And finally, ultrasound heating can help decrease muscle spasm, relaxing the tissue and improving mobility.\n\nNow, in addition to these thermal effects, ultrasound also causes non-thermal effects, and these are especially fascinating. Non-thermal effects are not caused by heating; instead, they result from mechanical interaction with the tissue — the actual pressure waves and oscillations in the medium.\nFor example, ultrasound can increase cell membrane permeability, allowing molecules to move in and out of cells more easily. It can also increase vascular permeability, which means that blood vessels become slightly more “leaky,” allowing nutrients or drugs to diffuse through more effectively. Both of these effects are very useful in therapeutic and drug delivery applications.\n\nUltrasound can also increase local blood flow without significant heating, helping tissue repair and regeneration. It can assist in the reduction of edema, which is the accumulation of fluid in tissues, and that makes it very useful for treating inflammation or swelling.\nOne of the most remarkable non-thermal effects is something called cavitation. Cavitation refers to the formation and oscillation of tiny bubbles — microscopic gas pockets — in the tissue fluid. At certain frequencies and intensities, these bubbles can oscillate and even collapse, releasing bursts of mechanical energy that can affect nearby cells or molecules.\n\nAs shown in the figure on this slide, you can see different frequency ranges where ultrasound is applied — from very low frequencies used in physiotherapy to higher frequencies used in imaging, Doppler studies, and even lithotripsy for breaking kidney stones. The likelihood of cavitation increases with lower frequency and higher acoustic pressure. However, for standard medical diagnostic ultrasound, which operates between about 3 and 20 megahertz, cavitation is highly unlikely, so it’s very safe.\nAlso notice the lower figure — it shows how ultrasound can enhance drug delivery. The red curve shows a larger uptake of drug when ultrasound is applied, compared to the blue curve, which shows little uptake without ultrasound. This demonstrates how ultrasound can help drugs penetrate biological barriers more effectively.\n\nSo, in summary, ultrasound has both thermal and non-thermal effects, and both can be used for different therapeutic and diagnostic purposes. The non-thermal effects, like increased permeability and cavitation, open up some exciting possibilities — such as ultrasound-mediated drug delivery and neurological stimulation. These are emerging areas of research and clinical application.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
