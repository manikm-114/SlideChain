From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo, how do we actually generate ultrasound waves?\n\nEarlier, I mentioned that if you push and pull repeatedly — like stretching and compressing a spring, or vibrating a rope — you can generate waves. Those are good heuristic examples to understand the idea. But for medical ultrasound, we need something that can vibrate millions of times per second — far beyond what we can do by hand. So, we use a physical mechanism called the piezoelectric effect.\n\nThe piezoelectric effect is truly fundamental to ultrasound imaging — it’s the enabling technology behind both the generation and detection of ultrasound waves. In fact, this phenomenon was so important that it earned recognition at the Nobel Prize level.\nNow, the piezoelectric effect works in two directions, which we call the direct effect and the reverse effect.\nLet’s start with the direct effect. When sound vibrations — that is, pressure waves — hit a piezoelectric crystal, the alternating pressure causes the crystal to deform mechanically. As the pressure oscillates from positive to negative, the crystal expands and contracts slightly. This mechanical deformation generates an electrical potential across its surfaces. In other words, mechanical energy — the sound vibration — is converted into electrical energy. This is how the ultrasound echo signal is detected by the transducer and turned into an electrical signal for processing.\n\nNow, the reverse effect works the other way around. When we apply a voltage across the piezoelectric crystal, it causes the crystal to deform — to change shape. When the voltage alternates — positive, then negative, then positive again — the crystal vibrates back and forth. If that electrical signal has a frequency in the ultrasound range, those vibrations produce ultrasound waves that propagate into the surrounding medium.\nSo you can see that the same piezoelectric element can do both jobs — it can generate ultrasound waves and also detect the returning echoes.\nHere’s how it all fits together: when you send a sinusoidal electrical signal to the crystal, it vibrates and emits an ultrasound wave that travels into the body. The wave reflects from tissue boundaries and returns to the transducer. Those returning pressure waves deform the crystal again, and the deformation creates an electrical signal that can be measured.\n\nThat’s why we call it a two-way transduction process — it goes from electrical energy to mechanical energy when we transmit, and back from mechanical to electrical energy when we receive.\nThis process — the piezoelectric effect — is the heart of every ultrasound transducer. It allows the probe to both send and receive sound waves, enabling us to form detailed medical images.\n\nSo, when you see the term “piezoelectric ceramics” or “piezoelectric crystals,” just remember: that’s what’s inside every ultrasound probe, converting electrical energy to sound and sound back to electrical energy, millions of times every second.\nAnd that’s the essence of how ultrasound imaging becomes possible.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
