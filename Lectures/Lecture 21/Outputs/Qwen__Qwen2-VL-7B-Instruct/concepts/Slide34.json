From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nSo this is your homework, and here we start to look at what modern ultrasound transducers actually look like inside. In most modern ultrasound systems, the transducers are not just a single piezoelectric element like we saw earlier — they’re made up of arrays of elements, either one-dimensional or two-dimensional. The image you see here is a schematic of a one-dimensional linear array transducer, which is very common in medical ultrasound imaging.\n\nYou can see that each piezo element is one tiny rectangular piece of piezoelectric material. Beneath these elements, we have the electrodes, which are used to apply oscillating sinusoidal electrical signals. These electrical signals cause the piezo elements to vibrate and generate ultrasound waves — and when echoes return from the body, those same elements work in reverse, converting mechanical vibration back into electrical signals.\n\nNow, above these piezoelectric elements, you can see matching layers — sometimes there are two, a first and a second matching layer. These are just like what we discussed earlier: they help transfer ultrasound energy more efficiently into the body by gradually matching the acoustic impedance between the crystal and the skin. The entire system is connected to a custom-designed flexible circuit that allows precise timing and control for each element, enabling electronic focusing and beam steering.\n\nBehind the piezo elements is the backing layer, which provides damping — it absorbs unwanted vibrations so that each pulse is short and clean. This improves axial resolution by preventing long “ringing” of the crystal. So, when everything is working together — the electrode, the matching layers, the gel, and the backing layer — the ultrasound energy is efficiently transmitted into the body, and the echoes return through the same path.\n\nIn essence, you have a system that is symmetrically optimized for both transmission and reception. The signal path forward is carefully matched, and the reverse path follows the same principle, leading to a higher signal-to-noise ratio and better overall image quality.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
