From the following slide text,\nextract the key technical or scientific concepts that are essential for understanding the topic.\n\nUser:\nSLIDE_TEXT:\nNow let’s move one step further — using microbubbles not just for imaging, but also for therapy.\nThis concept is known as acoustically enabled drug delivery. The idea is both simple and powerful. Suppose we inject a drug together with microbubbles into the bloodstream. These microbubbles circulate throughout the body, including through the small vessels, or microvasculature, around a tumor site.\n\nWhen we know the approximate location of a tumor, we can focus ultrasound waves precisely on that region. The ultrasound energy — tuned to the right amplitude and frequency — causes the microbubbles in that area to oscillate vigorously. If we increase the energy slightly, the bubbles rupture or collapse, releasing their drug payload right at the target site.\n\nThis process delivers the medication directly to the tumor, minimizing side effects and maximizing treatment effectiveness. It’s like having millions of tiny delivery capsules that release the drug only when and where an ultrasound activates them.\n\nThis technique opens the door to an entirely new field known as theranostics — combining therapy and diagnostics. With this approach, ultrasound imaging can both visualize and treat disease simultaneously. The precision and non-invasiveness of this method make it an extremely promising direction for the future, particularly for treating cancers and other localized diseases.\n\nSo, using ultrasound and microbubbles together, we can not only image internal structures in great detail but also control drug delivery dynamically — by sound waves themselves. This is an exciting frontier in biomedical engineering and medical imaging.\n\nSTRICT INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Return pure JSON only.
