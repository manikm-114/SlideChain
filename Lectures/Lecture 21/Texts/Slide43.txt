Alright, let’s wrap up today’s lecture. As we conclude, I’d like to give you the homework assignment for Ultrasound I.

You’ll be working on two related problems, both designed to reinforce your understanding of the transducer and matching layer concepts we discussed earlier. Please refer to your green textbook for additional details and supporting equations — it’s not difficult, and I’m confident you can handle it.

The first problem, number three point five, asks you to plot the transmitted frequency spectrum of an ultrasound beam from a transducer operating at a central frequency of one point five megahertz. Assume that the transducer is damped, and then repeat the plot for the beam returning to the transducer after passing through tissue and being backscattered.

The second problem, number three point six, focuses on the concept of the matching layer, which is one of the most important topics we covered today. The question is:“To improve the efficiency of a given transducer, the amount of energy reflected by the skin directly under the transducer must be minimized. A layer of material with an acoustic impedance Z M L is placed between the transducer and the skin. If the acoustic impedance of the skin is denoted by Z S, and that of the transducer crystal is denoted by Z C, show mathematically that the value of Z M L that minimizes the energy of the reflected wave is given by Z M L equals the square root of Z C multiplied by Z S.”

This derivation is straightforward, and you can find the full explanation in your textbook. The due date for this homework is one working week from today, so please make sure to submit it on time.

We’ll continue our discussion next time, where we’ll wrap up our study of ultrasound imaging. Remember — the matching layer is crucial, both conceptually and practically, because it determines how efficiently energy moves from the transducer into the body. Understanding it deeply will also help you as we move toward more advanced imaging systems in the upcoming lectures.
