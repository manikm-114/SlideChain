You might wonder, why does the piezoelectric effect actually happen? What’s going on inside the material that allows it to generate electricity when we apply pressure?This little cartoon, or infographic, explains it beautifully.

Imagine you have a crystal structure, such as quartz, that is in perfect static balance — both mechanically and electrically. In its no-stress state, the positive and negative charges are arranged symmetrically. The positive charges — usually from the silicon atoms — and the negative charges — from the oxygen atoms — balance one another out, so the overall crystal is electrically neutral. There is no net polarization, no voltage across the surfaces.

Now, let’s apply a horizontal tension — we’re stretching the crystal, pulling its sides apart. The crystal is stable but elastic, so it deforms slightly. When that happens, the charge centers shift — the positive charges move upward, and the negative charges move downward. That means the top surface becomes slightly positive, and the bottom surface becomes slightly negative. In other words, the mechanical strain has produced an electrical potential difference between the two surfaces.
Now imagine the opposite — a compression instead of tension. When we compress the crystal, we push those atoms closer together, but in the opposite direction. The negative charges are forced upward, and the positive charges are pushed downward. Now the top surface becomes negative, and the bottom surface becomes positive.

This alternation between tension and compression causes repeated charge separation, which is what generates an alternating voltage when the material is vibrated continuously.

So what you see in this diagram — the shift of positive and negative charge centers — is the fundamental reason behind the piezoelectric effect. Mechanical deformation creates electrical polarization, and electrical excitation can, in turn, create mechanical motion.
This is the microscopic picture that explains how piezoelectric crystals act as transducers, converting mechanical vibration into electrical energy and back again. It’s this static-electric imbalance, produced by strain, that forms the very foundation of ultrasound imaging.
