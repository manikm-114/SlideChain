So now you understand how we measure intensity, and how energy propagates through a medium. As the ultrasound wave travels through tissue, it doesn’t stay constant — it gets attenuated. That means the amplitude decreases gradually, and the intensity drops as the wave penetrates deeper. Later, we’ll see that the amplitude or intensity decays exponentially with depth, very similar to Beer’s law in optical physics.

Because of this, we often use relative intensity and relative power to describe how intensity changes with distance. And since these values can vary across a huge range — sometimes millions of times between the incident pulse and the reflected echo — it’s much easier to express them on a logarithmic scale.
This is where the decibel, or dB, scale comes in. It compresses large ratios into smaller, more manageable numbers. So, instead of dealing with enormous values, we talk about relative changes in decibels.

For ultrasound, pressure intensity is expressed in decibels. The unit of pressure is the Pascal, which is one Newton per square meter. The atmospheric pressure is about 0.1 megaPascal, while diagnostic ultrasound can have a peak pressure of around 1 megaPascal.

Now, we describe relative intensity using the formula 10 log of I2 over I1. This represents the change in intensity between two points. If you’re dealing with power, however, we use 20 log of P2 over P1, because power is proportional to the square of amplitude.

Let me explain that part carefully. In circuit theory, we know that power equals resistance times current squared — P equals R times I squared. The same idea applies here. Since power is proportional to amplitude squared, we need a factor of two in the logarithmic expression. That’s why, for power, we multiply by 20 instead of 10.

So, in summary:– When we talk about intensity, we use 10 log because intensity is directly proportional to energy flow.– When we talk about power, we use 20 log because it depends on amplitude squared.
A 10 dB change corresponds to a factor of 10 change in intensity.A 20 dB change corresponds to a factor of 100 change in intensity.
This logarithmic relationship is used throughout ultrasound physics because it helps us describe very large variations in intensity and power in a compact, practical way.
