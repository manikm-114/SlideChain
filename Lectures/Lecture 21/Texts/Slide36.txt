Now, let’s move on to beam geometry, which gives us a deeper understanding of how ultrasound beams behave as they propagate through space. This figure from your textbook shows the beam shape produced by a single crystal transducer.
When the transducer vibrates, it sends energy downward in a conical shape. The region closest to the transducer is called the near field, and beyond a certain point — called the near field boundary — the beam starts to diverge, entering what we call the far field.

In the near field, the beam diameter is roughly the same as the transducer’s aperture — so if the transducer has a diameter “a,” the beam width is about the same. But after the near field boundary, the beam starts to spread out or diverge. This divergence angle, which we call theta, is determined by the wavelength lambda and the transducer aperture “a.” It’s given approximately by the equation:

theta equals arc sine of zero point six one times lambda divided by a.

This relationship shows that smaller apertures or larger wavelengths give wider beams — meaning poorer lateral resolution.
Now, within any cross-section of the beam, the intensity isn’t uniform. Along the central axis, the signal is strongest, and as you move away to the sides, the intensity decreases. The intensity profile across the beam can often be approximated by a Gaussian distribution, meaning it has a peak at the center and falls off symmetrically.
To describe this beam width, we use a quantity called full width at half maximum, or F-W-H-M, which literally means the width of the beam where the intensity drops to half of its peak value. For a Gaussian profile, the FWHM is approximately two point three six times sigma, where sigma is the standard deviation of the Gaussian. Mathematically, we write it as:

FWHM equals two times the square root of two times the natural log of two, multiplied by sigma — approximately equal to two point three six sigma.
This measurement gives us a good estimate of the lateral resolution of the ultrasound beam. The narrower the beam, the better the lateral resolution — meaning you can distinguish two nearby structures more clearly.

So, beam geometry, frequency, aperture size, and attenuation — all these factors together define how sharp and how deep your ultrasound image will be.
