In this lecture, our main focus is on the physical principles of ultrasound. We’ll start by understanding what an ultrasound wave really is — how it’s generated, how it travels through biological tissue, and how it interacts with different types of materials inside the body. These are the physical foundations of ultrasound imaging.

Then, we’ll shift to the engineering aspects — how we actually generate and detect these waves using an ultrasound transducer. You’ll hear me mention the term “transducer” a lot today. The word transduction means converting one form of energy into another. In our case, the transducer converts electrical energy into mechanical vibration to generate the ultrasound wave. When the reflected wave comes back, the same device converts the mechanical vibration back into electrical signals. So it’s a two-way process — we transmit and receive using the same component.

We’ll look at both single-unit and array-based transducers, and we’ll talk about different types of resolution specific to ultrasound — axial resolution, lateral resolution, and spatial resolution. Each of these determines how finely we can distinguish structures in an image.

We’ll also talk about imaging contrast, which is very important for ultrasound. You’ll learn about natural contrast, as well as how we can enhance contrast using microbubbles. Microbubbles are a very clever and modern idea — tiny gas bubbles injected into the bloodstream to improve visibility in ultrasound. They’re not discussed much in your textbook, but I’ll expand on them to give you a sense of current developments in ultrasound imaging.

So this is our outline for today. And as always, for every imaging modality we study, pay close attention to the outline — it tells you exactly what to focus on. Try to understand each of these key ideas clearly — the wave, the transducer, the resolution, and the contrast — because together, they form the foundation for everything that follows in ultrasound imaging.
