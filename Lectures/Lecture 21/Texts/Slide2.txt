Here’s our course schedule to remind you where we are. After these two lectures on ultrasound, we’ll finish the green book, which means we’ll have covered everything from X-ray, CT, MRI, PET, to ultrasound imaging.

After that, we’ll move beyond the textbook to discuss optical imaging. This topic is not included in the green book, but they’re very important to know. Optical imaging is fascinating, and like US imaging it becomes increasingly relevant with advancement of AI methods in this area.

For now, your main focus should be on the ultrasound chapter in the green book. It’s about twenty pages long, so it’s quite manageable. I recommend reading it carefully — it’s actually quite an enjoyable read, almost like a story.

So today, let me walk you through the first part of that chapter — the foundation that connects the physics of sound with medical imaging.
