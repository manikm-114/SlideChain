Now that we understand damping, let’s move on to another important component — the matching layer. You can see from this slide that the transducer structure includes this special layer right in front of the piezoelectric crystal, and this layer is absolutely essential for getting ultrasound energy efficiently into the body. Let me start with a quick personal story. I once mentioned that I had a kidney stone, and when you go for an ultrasound scan like that, you’ll notice the doctor always applies a gel on the skin. The gel is completely harmless and painless, though yes, it can feel a little messy. But that gel is doing something very important — it’s not just for comfort or for better contact. It actually helps solve what we call a matching problem.

Here’s why. The piezoelectric material inside the transducer, usually something like PZT — that stands for lead zirconate titanate — has a very high acoustic impedance, which we call Z P or Z transducer. The human skin, on the other hand, has a much lower acoustic impedance, which we call Z skin. And between the two surfaces there are often tiny air bubbles, because the skin isn’t perfectly smooth. Now, whenever two materials with very different acoustic impedances are in contact, most of the ultrasound energy reflects back instead of transmitting forward. So the ultrasound wave generated by the crystal would mostly bounce back at the surface — kind of like shouting into a canyon and hearing your echo. That’s bad for imaging because very little energy actually enters the body.

So what do we do? We introduce a matching layer — a thin material layer whose acoustic impedance lies between those two values. This layer acts as a bridge, transferring acoustic energy more efficiently from the transducer into the skin. Here’s how it works. The vibration from the crystal first transfers its energy into the matching layer, and then from the matching layer into the skin. So instead of one big impedance jump, we now have two smaller steps — from crystal to matching layer, and from matching layer to skin.

Mathematically, the amount of energy that gets transmitted from one medium into another depends on their respective acoustic impedances. The transmitted intensity between two media is proportional to the product of their impedances divided by the square of their sum — that’s shown in the equation on the slide. To optimize this transmission, we choose the impedance of the matching layer carefully. The ideal acoustic impedance of the matching layer, which we call Z M, is the geometric mean of the two adjacent impedances. So we say, Z M equals the square root of Z transducer multiplied by Z skin. Again, that’s Z M equals the square root of Z transducer times Z skin.

This relationship minimizes reflection and maximizes transmission, allowing most of the ultrasound energy to enter the body and come back to the transducer as echoes. That’s why every ultrasound probe has a matching layer built in, and that’s also why we always use gel on the skin — the gel acts as an acoustic coupling medium that functions as part of the matching layer system. And by the way, as you can see on the slide, this topic might appear in your homework, so make sure you remember it.

To summarize: without the matching layer, most of the ultrasound energy would just reflect at the skin’s surface. With the matching layer — and with the gel acting as a coupling medium — the energy is transmitted efficiently, first from the crystal to the gel, then from the gel to the body. This ensures stronger echoes, clearer signals, and higher-quality ultrasound images.
