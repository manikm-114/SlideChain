Now that we know what a wave looks like, let’s think about how a wave is formed. This is a really fundamental question — what makes a wave a wave?
To understand this, we need to bring together three important physical principles.
First, the conservation of mass, which tells us that mass cannot be created or destroyed — it must remain constant within the system.Second, there’s the relationship between pressure and volume — when you squeeze something, the pressure inside changes in a predictable way.And third, we have Newton’s second law, which relates force to mass and acceleration.

If you imagine a perfectly rigid body, and you push on one end, the entire object moves together as one piece — there’s no wave because nothing inside deforms or compresses. But in real materials, there’s some elasticity — things can compress slightly and bounce back. That elasticity allows small disturbances to propagate as waves.
So, when you push on a small region, it compresses and transmits that force to its neighbors, setting off a chain reaction that moves through the medium. The result is a wave.

Now, if we were talking about electromagnetic waves, such as light or X-rays, we’d describe them using Maxwell’s equations. For mechanical waves, like ultrasound, we instead rely on these three mechanical principles: conservation of mass, the pressure–volume relationship, and Newton’s second law.

In more advanced, graduate-level courses, we can actually derive the full wave equation from these laws step by step. But for now, the key point is understanding the intuition — waves exist because a local disturbance in pressure or motion creates a self-sustaining pattern that propagates through the medium.

And for me personally, this is the fun part — not just using formulas, but really understanding why these waves behave the way they do. Once you grasp these core principles, you can always work out the details later. The details may change from one problem to another, but the underlying physics stays the same. That’s what gives you real insight — and the ability to think beyond just using a device as a “black box.”

So now, with this foundation, let’s look specifically at how we form an ultrasound wave.
